The 2017 Volvo S90 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of Scandinavian design, comfort, and technology. Engine options included the T5 (2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4), the T6 (2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged Inline-4), and the T8 (2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged Inline-4 Plug-in Hybrid). The T5 produced 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, while the T6 delivered 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The T8, combining the T6 engine with an electric motor, generated a total system output of 400 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque. All engine options were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praised the S90 for its elegant styling, comfortable ride, and advanced safety features. Common complaints centered around the sometimes-complex infotainment system, and occasional electronic glitches.

**2.0L T5 Turbocharged Inline-4**
*   **No Issues Found**

**2.0L T6 Turbocharged and Supercharged Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Oil consumption is commonly checked for a leak and replaced with the faulty part. If there are no leaks, the entire engine will have to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $10,000+

**2.0L T8 Turbocharged and Supercharged Inline-4 Plug-in Hybrid**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**Aisin Warner 8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**
*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experienced rough shifting, hesitation, or jerking during gear changes, especially at lower speeds. This was commonly reported as a symptom of a software issue.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) was often the first step. In some cases, a transmission flush or replacement of valve body components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with the optional rear air suspension sometimes experienced failures, resulting in a sagging rear end, ride height control issues, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air springs or the air compressor is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system, while visually appealing, was prone to glitches, freezing, slow response times, and connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates were frequently released to address these issues. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported issues with the car's battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle was left unused for a few days. This was often attributed to parasitic drain from various electronic modules.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the drain, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+
*    **Pilot Assist Malfunction**
        * Description/Symptoms: The Pilot Assist function may experience issues that would render it inoperative. This is caused by faults in the sensors or other modules that are responsible for the system, which could trigger a diagnostic trouble code.
        * Solution: Scanning the system with an OBD-II scanner to identify the specific fault code. Check sensors for obstruction or damage. Depending on the fault codes, recalibration may be needed, or the module may need to be replaced.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2,000+

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

**Summary**

The 2017 Volvo S90 presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from minor electrical glitches to more significant mechanical concerns like air suspension failure or excessive oil consumption in the T6 engine. While some issues are resolved through software updates, others require more costly repairs. The infotainment system can be frustrating, and potential battery drain issues require careful monitoring. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into the overall cost of ownership. While not widespread, the air suspension and transmission issues can be expensive to rectify.
