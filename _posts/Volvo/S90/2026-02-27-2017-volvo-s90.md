### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volvo S90 demonstrates good overall reliability, with most reported issues being relatively minor and often addressable through software updates or component replacements. Potential concerns include coolant leaks in the T5 engine, overheating in the T6, and DPF issues in diesel variants. The automatic transmission is generally robust, though some owners have reported occasional shifting anomalies. The optional air suspension can be a source of leaks, and electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and intermittent battery drain, are not uncommon. Exterior and interior components are largely free of widespread problems. Proactive maintenance and addressing early warning signs are recommended for optimal long-term ownership.
