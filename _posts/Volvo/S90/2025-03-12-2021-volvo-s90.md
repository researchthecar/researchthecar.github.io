The 2021 Volvo S90 is a luxury sedan known for its elegant styling, comfortable interior, and advanced safety features. Available powertrains include the T5, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and the T6, which adds a supercharger to the 2.0-liter four-cylinder, boosting output to 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The T8 eAWD plug-in hybrid combines a turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with an electric motor, delivering a combined 400 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the S90's sophisticated design, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. Some common criticisms include the infotainment system's complexity and the relatively limited rear-seat headroom.

**Summary**

The 2021 Volvo S90 generally holds up well in terms of reliability, but some owners do report specific issues, most notably with the infotainment system, potential oil consumption in the T5 engine, and the potential for transmission issues. If the vehicle is equipped with it, the air suspension may need to be repaired. Most of the issues should not have safety impacts but may cause discomfort and frustration. The cost of repairs can vary widely, with electrical issues potentially being the most affordable to fix with just a software update while more serious mechanical repairs can become quite costly.
