### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Volvo S90 demonstrates good overall reliability, with most owners reporting a positive experience. The primary areas that may require attention are specific powertrain components, particularly on the more complex T6 and T8 hybrid variants, where coolant leaks and hybrid battery cooling issues have been noted. Electrical systems, especially the infotainment unit, can occasionally suffer from software glitches requiring updates. While not common, premature 12V battery failure and condensation in LED headlights are also potential concerns. The suspension and interior components are generally robust. For owners of the T5 engine and standard transmission, reliability is particularly high. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are recommended to ensure long-term dependability.
