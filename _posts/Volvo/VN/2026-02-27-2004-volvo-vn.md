### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volvo VN demonstrates solid reliability, especially in its core mechanical components like manual transmissions and chassis. The primary areas requiring attention tend to be the emissions control systems (EGR coolers, DPFs) on the diesel engines, which are common across many heavy-duty trucks of this era. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to wiring harnesses and control modules, can also arise due to age and mileage. While the automated I-Shift transmission has potential actuator issues, the manual Eaton Fuller units are generally robust. Regular maintenance and proactive checks of the emissions and electrical systems are recommended to ensure continued dependable service.
