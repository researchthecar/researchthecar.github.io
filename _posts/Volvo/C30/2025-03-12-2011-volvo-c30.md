The 2011 Volvo C30 is a sporty, compact hatchback known for its distinctive styling and European driving dynamics. Engine options include a 2.4i inline-5 producing 168 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5L T5 inline-5 producing 227 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options for the T5 engine include a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. The 2.4i is only available with a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the C30's unique design, comfortable front seats, and relatively fuel-efficient engines. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space, and the firm ride.

**Summary**

The 2011 Volvo C30, while generally reliable, can experience issues such as oil leaks, PCV system failures (especially in the T5 engine), and potential valve body problems with the 5-speed automatic transmission. Electrical issues, particularly with the CEM, can also occur. Suspension components are prone to wear, contributing to ride and handling issues. While many of these issues are relatively minor, some, like CEM failure or transmission problems, can be more costly to repair. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
