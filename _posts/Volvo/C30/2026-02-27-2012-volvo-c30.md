### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Volvo C30 is a generally reliable vehicle, especially when equipped with the naturally aspirated 2.4L engine. The more performance-oriented 2.5L T5 engine, while offering exhilarating driving, presents a few more potential issues, primarily related to the PCV system and turbocharger, which are common for turbocharged performance engines. Automatic transmission issues, particularly fluid leaks and solenoid problems, are noted for the AW55-50SN. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or sensors, can occur but are not overwhelmingly prevalent. Overall, the C30 offers a good balance of style and dependability, with most issues being manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. Owners should be aware of the specific needs of the T5 engine and the automatic transmission.
