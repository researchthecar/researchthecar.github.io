### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volvo S80 is a generally well-built vehicle with a reputation for safety and comfort. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly concerning the PCV system and turbocharger on the 2.5T models, and timing chain tensioners on the 3.2L inline-six. Diesel variants may encounter DPF-related problems. Transmission issues, while not rampant, can occur, often related to fluid leaks or solenoid failures.
