### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Volvo S80, while offering a comfortable and safe driving experience, presents a mixed reliability profile. Owners should be aware of potential issues primarily within the powertrain, particularly with the automatic transmission's tendency for harsh shifting and the possibility of oil or coolant leaks from the inline-6 engines. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or ABS module, are also a notable concern. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks can wear over time. While the exterior is generally robust, interior climate control and power seat components can occasionally fail. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the S80's longevity.
