### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Volvo S80 is a comfortable and safe luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Powertrain reliability varies by engine, with the inline-6 engines potentially facing oil leaks and the turbocharged variants susceptible to turbocharger and PCV issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the AW55-50SN, are known for solenoid and torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and window regulators, are also frequently reported. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks can wear out. While the exterior is generally robust, headlight lenses can degrade. Interior climate control panels and seat functions can also develop faults. Regular maintenance and proactive attention to these known issues are crucial for maintaining the S80's reliability and value.
