### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Volvo S80 offers a comfortable and safe driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with its engines and automatic transmissions. Oil and coolant leaks are prevalent in the inline-6 engines, while the twin-turbo variant can suffer from turbocharger problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the older 4-speed, may exhibit harsh shifting or slipping. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module or ABS module, can also arise. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts are also wear items that may require attention. Despite these potential drawbacks, many S80s have proven durable with proper maintenance, making them a potentially good value if well-maintained and any existing issues are addressed.
