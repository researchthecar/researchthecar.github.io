Electrical problems, such as battery drain and CEM failures, can also occur. Suspension and interior issues, such as worn strut mounts, shock absorbers, sunroof malfunctions, navigation screen failures, and heater core leaks, can add to the ownership cost. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing thousands of dollars. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
