### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Volvo S80 offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly in its exterior and interior components where widespread issues are uncommon. However, potential owners should be aware of specific concerns related to the engine and transmission. The V8 engine can be prone to timing chain and coolant issues, while the turbocharged engines may face turbocharger or PCV problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the earlier AW55-50/51SN and later TF-80/81SC, can experience solenoid or mechatronic unit failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the CEM module and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts may require attention over time. Addressing these potential issues proactively can contribute to a more dependable ownership experience.
