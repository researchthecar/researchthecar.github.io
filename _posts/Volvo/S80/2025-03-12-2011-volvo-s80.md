Electrical issues with the CEM can also be frustrating to diagnose and fix. While the S80 offers a comfortable and safe driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures.
