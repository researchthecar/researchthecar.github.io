### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volvo S80 offers a generally solid ownership experience, with its most common technical concerns revolving around the PCV system and turbocharger on the 2.5T engine, and timing chain issues on the 3.2L. The V8 engine has fewer reported widespread issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the older AW55 series, can experience issues with their control modules and solenoids. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the CEM module or parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While the suspension, exterior, and interior are relatively robust, climate control system issues can arise. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning the PCV system and timely transmission fluid changes, can mitigate many potential problems.
