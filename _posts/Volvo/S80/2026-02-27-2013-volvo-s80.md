### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Volvo S80 is generally a reliable luxury sedan, particularly with its naturally aspirated engines. The optional turbocharged 2.0L GTDi engine shows some potential for turbocharger and coolant system issues, which are not uncommon for turbocharged applications. Transmission issues, primarily fluid leaks and solenoid problems, are reported but often manageable with timely repairs. The optional Four-C active suspension can be a source of costly electronic damper failures. Electrical gremlins like battery drain and sensor issues are present but not overwhelmingly prevalent. Overall, the S80 offers a good balance of comfort and dependability, with most potential issues being addressable and not indicative of systemic design flaws.
