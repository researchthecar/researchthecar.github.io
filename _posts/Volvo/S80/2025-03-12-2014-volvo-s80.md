The 2014 Volvo S80 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a reputation for safety. Engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, a 3.2L inline-6, and a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6. The 2.0L produced approximately 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The inline-6 engines offered more power and refinement. Owners often praise the S80 for its comfortable seats, quiet cabin, and safety features. Common criticisms include the somewhat dated infotainment system and the limited rear seat legroom compared to some competitors.

**Summary**
The 2014 Volvo S80, while generally reliable, can suffer from a few common issues.
