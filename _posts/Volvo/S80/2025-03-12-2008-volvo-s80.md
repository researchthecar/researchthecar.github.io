The 2008 Volvo S80 is a mid-size luxury sedan that offered a blend of comfort, safety, and understated elegance. Engine options included a 3.2L inline-6 producing 235 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, a 4.4L V8 producing 311 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 producing 281 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque (introduced later in the model year). All engine options were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the S80's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for safety. However, some criticisms include the somewhat dated infotainment system, potential for costly repairs, and the slightly underwhelming performance of the base engine for some drivers.
