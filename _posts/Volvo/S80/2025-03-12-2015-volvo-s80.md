The 2015 Volvo S80 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfort, safety features, and understated elegance. Engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (T5), a 2.5L turbocharged five-cylinder (T5), and a 3.0L turbocharged inline-six (T6). The T5 2.0L engine produces 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the S80's comfortable ride and spacious interior but sometimes find the infotainment system dated and the fuel economy less competitive than some rivals.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (T5)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption in the 2.0L T5 engine. Symptoms include needing to add oil between scheduled oil changes and potentially seeing a low oil level warning light.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the PCV valve has helped, but if the issue persists, further investigation is needed to check for leaks or internal engine damage. A leak-down test can help determine if the piston rings are sealing properly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the source of the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Volvo S80 has some common issues, ranging from moderate to potentially expensive repairs. The most significant issues relate to the torque converter, electrical problems (CEM), and rear air suspension (if equipped).
