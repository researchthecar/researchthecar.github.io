### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Volvo S80 is a comfortable and safe luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The engines, particularly the turbocharged variants, can experience oil leaks and PCV system problems. Automatic transmissions, specifically the AW55-50SN, are prone to harsh shifting and control module failures. Electrical gremlins are a significant concern, often stemming from the BCM, CEM, or ABS module. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts can wear out. While the exterior is generally robust, interior climate control panels and seat heaters can be points of failure. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these known issues are crucial for maintaining the S80's reliability.
