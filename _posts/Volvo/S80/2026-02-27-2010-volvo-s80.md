### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Volvo S80, while offering a premium experience, presents a few key areas that may require attention. The engines, particularly the V8 and the 3.2L inline-six, can experience issues related to PCV systems and oil seals, while the 2.5T can have turbocharger concerns. The automatic transmission is generally robust but can develop solenoid or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the CEM module or parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Interior electronics, such as the infotainment system, can occasionally glitch. However, suspension and exterior components are typically reliable. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the S80's long-term dependability.
