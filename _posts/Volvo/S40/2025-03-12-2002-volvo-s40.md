The 2002 Volvo S40 is a compact sedan known for its safety features and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 1.9L turbocharged inline-four (160 hp, 170 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.0L inline-five (160 hp, 162 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were offered with a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the car's reliability and handling, while some common dislikes include the relatively small back seat, the lackluster fuel economy for a compact car, and the age of parts making them hard to find.

**Summary**
The 2002 Volvo S40, while generally reliable, is prone to certain age-related issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly oil leaks and automatic transmission slippage, can be costly to address. Suspension wear is common, and electrical issues can also arise. Potential buyers should have the car thoroughly inspected, paying particular attention to the engine, transmission, and suspension components, and factor these potential repairs into their budget. The severity of these issues can range from minor nuisances to major mechanical failures, and the cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the mechanic performing the work.
