### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Volvo S40 presents a generally solid ownership experience, particularly regarding its safety and structural integrity. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues that can arise, primarily concerning the automatic transmission, where slipping and control module failures are noted. Engine-related concerns, such as oil leaks and PCV system clogs on the naturally aspirated variants, and turbocharger issues on the turbocharged models, are also documented. Electrical gremlins, like failing window regulators and sensors, can add to ownership costs. The manual transmission and the exterior/interior components generally hold up well. Regular maintenance, especially for the automatic transmission fluid, is crucial for mitigating some of these potential problems.
