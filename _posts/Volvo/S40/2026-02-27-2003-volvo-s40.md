### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Volvo S40, while offering good safety and a comfortable ride, presents a few common areas for potential concern. The turbocharged 1.9L engine can be prone to turbocharger issues and PCV system clogging. Automatic transmissions, particularly the AW55-50SN, may experience leaks or solenoid failures. On the electrical side, the Body Control Module and ABS module are known to be potential failure points, leading to various system malfunctions. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, causing noise and handling issues. Interior electrical components like the HVAC blower resistor are also noted. Despite these points, many S40s have proven to be reliable with proper maintenance, and the issues, while specific, are often repairable.
