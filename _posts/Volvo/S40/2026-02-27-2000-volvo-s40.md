### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Volvo S40 offers a generally robust ownership experience, particularly in its exterior and basic chassis components. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the turbocharged engine's turbocharger and oil seals, as well as common automatic transmission problems like harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and ABS modules, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts can wear over time. Regular maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission and monitoring for oil leaks, is crucial for longevity. While not immune to age-related issues, addressing these specific points can help maintain the S40's reliability.
