### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volvo S40 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly praised for its safety features and comfortable ride. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, especially concerning the engine's PCV system and oil leaks on the naturally aspirated variants, and turbocharger or ignition coil concerns on the T5 models. Automatic transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, can be costly to repair. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts may require attention as the vehicle ages. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the CEM module and window regulators, are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can significantly mitigate these potential reliability concerns.
