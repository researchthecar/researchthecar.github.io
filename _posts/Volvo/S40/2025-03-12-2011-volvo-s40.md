The 2011 Volvo S40 is a compact sedan known for its safety, comfortable ride, and distinctive Scandinavian design. Engine options included a 2.4-liter inline-5 naturally aspirated engine producing 168 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-5 engine producing 227 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque (T5). Transmission options were a 5-speed automatic (2.4i) or a 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual (T5). Owners generally appreciate the car's safety features, comfortable seats, and fuel economy. Common dislikes include relatively small back seats and some potential for expensive repairs as the car ages.

**Summary**

The 2011 Volvo S40 can present a range of issues as it ages, with engine and transmission problems being potentially the most costly. PCV system issues on the 2.4i and turbocharger issues on the T5 are common engine concerns. The AW55-50SN automatic transmission can experience valve body problems leading to expensive repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with the CEM and ABS module, can also be problematic. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as turbocharger or ABS module replacement, can be significant. Regular maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly can help prevent more serious and costly problems down the road.
