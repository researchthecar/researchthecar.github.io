The 2010 Volvo S40 is a compact sedan known for its safety, comfort, and Scandinavian design. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-5 producing 168 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5L inline-5 generating 227 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while some T5 models had a 6-speed manual option. Owners often praise the S40 for its comfortable seats, solid build quality, and distinctive styling. Common complaints include relatively small rear seats, some reported issues with electronic components, and higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors.

**Summary**
The 2010 Volvo S40, while generally reliable, can suffer from a range of issues, some of which can be relatively costly to repair. Engine problems, such as oil leaks and ignition coil failures, can occur. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, may require significant repairs. Electrical problems related to the CEM or ABS module can also be expensive. Suspension components are subject to wear and tear, and broken coil springs or worn bushings are common. While not all S40s will experience all of these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, as well as budget for potential repairs and maintenance.
