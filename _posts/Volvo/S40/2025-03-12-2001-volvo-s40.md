The 2001 Volvo S40 is a compact sedan known for its safety and comfort. Two engine options were available: a 1.9L turbocharged inline-four producing 160 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L inline-five cylinder producing 160 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Both were typically paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the S40's comfortable ride and relatively fuel-efficient engines, but common complaints often revolve around the reliability of some components and the cost of replacement parts.

**Summary**

The 2001 Volvo S40 can be a comfortable and reliable car with regular maintenance. However, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues listed above. Engine issues like MAF sensor and TCV failures, along with potential transmission problems (especially with the automatic), and suspension wear are the most significant concerns. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and the associated costs can vary widely. Electrical and interior issues, while less frequent, can also add to the overall cost of ownership. Rust is a concern for vehicles in colder climates. Overall, prospective owners should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and condition before purchasing.
