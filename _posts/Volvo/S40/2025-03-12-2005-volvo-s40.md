The 2005 Volvo S40 is a compact sedan that offers a blend of comfort, safety, and European styling. Engine options included a 2.4i naturally aspirated 5-cylinder producing 168 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque, and the more powerful T5, a 2.5L turbocharged 5-cylinder generating 218 hp and 236 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. A 5-speed manual transmission was also available on the T5. Owners often appreciate the S40's comfortable ride, distinctive design, and reputation for safety. Downsides frequently cited include relatively high maintenance costs, some quirky electronic features, and limited rear seat space compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2005 Volvo S40, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have its share of common issues. Engine issues such as ETM or Turbo failures can be expensive, and transmission issues can occur, with valve bodies being the main source of problems. Electrical issues, particularly those related to the CEM, can be difficult to diagnose and costly to repair. Suspension components also tend to wear out, leading to noticeable noises and handling problems. While some repairs are relatively minor, others can be quite costly, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
