### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Volvo S40 presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the 1.9L turbo, can be prone to turbocharger issues and oil leaks, while the 2.0L may experience coolant leaks. Automatic transmissions, specifically the AW55-50SN, are known for potential slipping and harsh shifting issues, often requiring significant repair. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items that can lead to noise and handling problems. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can manifest as various system malfunctions. Exterior rust, especially on lower body panels, and interior wear on the driver's seat bolster are also points to consider. Despite these potential issues, many S40s have proven durable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, especially those with manual transmissions.
