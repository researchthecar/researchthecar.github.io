**Introduction:**

The 2004 Volvo S40 is a compact luxury sedan that was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.4-liter inline-5 with 140 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, while the T5 model received a turbocharged version of the same engine that produced 218 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic, and a 6-speed automatic. The S40 was praised for its comfortable interior, responsive handling, and stylish exterior.
