The 2020 Volvo V60 Cross Country is a versatile and stylish wagon known for its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and standard all-wheel drive. The primary engine option for this model year is the T5 Drive-E 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate its sophisticated design, comfortable seats, and safety features. However, common complaints include the infotainment system's complexity, some reported reliability issues, and higher maintenance costs compared to other vehicles in its class.

**Engine**

**T5 Drive-E 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust might also be present in severe cases.
    *   Solution: The severity of the consumption should be measured by a qualified mechanic. If the consumption exceeds manufacturer specifications (often 1 quart per 1,000 miles), the potential repairs could be valve stem seal replacement, piston ring replacement, or even engine replacement in extreme cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur at various points in the cooling system, but common areas include the water pump and coolant hoses. Symptoms include low coolant level, overheating, and visible coolant puddles under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component, which may be a hose, water pump, or other cooling system part. A pressure test can help pinpoint the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin AW TG-81SC 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifting, especially between lower gears. Hesitation upon acceleration can also occur.
    *   Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and inspection. If the problem persists, valve body issues could be present, requiring valve body replacement or repair. In more severe cases, complete transmission replacement or rebuild may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches/Freezing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system can be prone to glitches, freezing, and slow response times. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions integrated into the system.
    *   Solution: Start with a software update through the dealer. If the issues persist, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws using a multimeter. A failing battery should be replaced. If a parasitic draw is found, the faulty component (e.g., module, sensor) needs to be identified and repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (battery replacement) - $500+ (parasitic draw diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found
