The 2015 Volvo V60 Cross Country is a wagon-like crossover known for its blend of comfort, safety, and all-weather capability. The T5 Drive-E engine, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, was the primary powerplant. It was paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the V60 Cross Country's comfortable ride, distinctive styling, and standard safety features. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated infotainment system and higher repair costs compared to some competitors.
