The 2022 Volvo V60 Cross Country is a versatile wagon known for its blend of comfort, style, and off-road capability. It typically comes equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque.

Owners often praise its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and distinctive Scandinavian design. Common complaints sometimes include the infotainment system's complexity and the vehicle's overall cost.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (B5)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between service intervals. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, consult a Volvo technician to check for leaks, worn piston rings, or valve seals. A software update may also address the issue in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+ depending on the source of the consumption.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle stalls while driving or at a stop, causing a safety hazard.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of faulty fuel pump or fuel delivery components.

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rough or jerky shifting between gears, especially during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. The transmission may hesitate or clunk when shifting.
    *   Solution: A software update from Volvo may improve shift quality. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and fill can help. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal damage may require more extensive repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5,000+ depending on the severity.

* **Hesitation When Accelerating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay or hesitation when pressing the accelerator pedal, particularly from a standstill or at low speeds. This can make merging into traffic or quick maneuvers challenging.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates. In some cases, a throttle position sensor issue or other sensor malfunction can cause this. Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty component is often the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1,000+
