The 2020 Volvo B8R is a popular bus chassis known for its reliability and versatility, used in a variety of applications from city buses to luxury coaches. While specific engine options can vary depending on the regional market and application, a common configuration is the Volvo D8K engine. The D8K is a 7.7-liter inline-six diesel engine, typically producing around 330-360 horsepower and 900-1400 Nm of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Common transmission choices are Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the B8R for its smooth ride, fuel efficiency, and robust construction. However, some criticisms include the complexity of the electronic systems and potential for higher maintenance costs compared to simpler bus chassis.
