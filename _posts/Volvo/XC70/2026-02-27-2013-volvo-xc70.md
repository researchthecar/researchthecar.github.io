### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Volvo XC70 generally presents a solid reliability record, especially for its powertrain and chassis components when properly maintained. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the PCV system on the 6-cylinder engines, turbocharger concerns on the T5 models, and occasional transmission glitches like harsh shifting or mechatronic unit problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the CEM module and battery drain, can also arise. While interior electronics like the infotainment system may experience occasional software-related issues, these are often resolvable with updates. Overall, the XC70 remains a durable and safe choice, but proactive maintenance and awareness of these specific potential issues can help ensure a smoother ownership experience.
