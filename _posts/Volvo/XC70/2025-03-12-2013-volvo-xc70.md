The 2013 Volvo XC70 is a wagon known for its safety, comfort, and practicality. Engine options for this year include a 3.2L inline-6, a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (depending on the market). The 3.2L engine produces 240 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Common praises for the XC70 include its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and all-weather capability. Criticisms often revolve around the somewhat dated infotainment system, fuel economy, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2013 Volvo XC70 presents a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. The most concerning problems involve the turbocharger in the 3.0L engine and valve body issues in the Aisin transmission, which can lead to substantial repair costs. Electrical gremlins related to the CEM can also be expensive to diagnose and fix. Other common problems like coolant reservoir cracking, shock absorber wear, and oil leaks, while not as catastrophic, still require attention and can add to the overall cost of ownership. While these issues don't necessarily indicate that the XC70 is unreliable, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs.
