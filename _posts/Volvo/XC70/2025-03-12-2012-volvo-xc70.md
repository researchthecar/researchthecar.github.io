The 2012 Volvo XC70 is a versatile wagon known for its safety, comfort, and practicality. This model year offered several engine options: a 3.2L inline-6 producing 240 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 producing 300 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-5 diesel.
