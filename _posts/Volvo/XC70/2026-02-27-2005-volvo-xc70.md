### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Volvo XC70 offers a compelling blend of practicality and comfort, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 2.5L turbocharged engine can experience problems with the PCV system and turbocharger, while the automatic transmission may develop issues with solenoids or the torque converter. The AWD system's Haldex coupling is a known point of failure. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or CEM modules, are also reported. While the exterior is generally robust, interior issues like clogged sunroof drains can occur. Despite these potential drawbacks, many XC70s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and timely repairs, especially addressing the known weak points.
