### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Volvo XC70 is a robust vehicle with a generally good reliability record. The most common areas of concern tend to be related to the powertrain, specifically the automatic transmission's solenoids and torque converter, and potential issues with the PCV system and turbocharger on the 2.5L engine. The all-wheel-drive system, while beneficial, can also present repair costs if the rear differential or Haldex coupling requires attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the CEM module, can be a significant expense if they arise. Despite these potential issues, many XC70s continue to serve their owners well with proper maintenance. Addressing known weak points proactively can mitigate the risk of more costly repairs.
