### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volvo XC70 is a robust vehicle with a generally good reliability record. The most common reported issues tend to be related to the PCV system on both engine variants, and potential leaks or solenoid issues in the automatic transmission. Suspension components, particularly rear springs and control arm bushings, can also require attention as the vehicle ages. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the CEM module, are not uncommon. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are often manageable and do not indicate a fundamental flaw in the vehicle's design. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate these potential problems.
