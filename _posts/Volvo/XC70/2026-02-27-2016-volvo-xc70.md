### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volvo XC70 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core mechanical components and body structure. Owners can expect a durable vehicle with a comfortable and practical interior. The most frequently cited technical issues tend to revolve around the diesel engine variants, specifically related to emissions systems like the EGR valve and DPF, and potential turbocharger problems. Automatic transmission issues, while not pervasive, can include leaks and torque converter concerns. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components like bushings and strut mounts may require attention as mileage increases. The gasoline engines and most interior and exterior elements are generally trouble-free. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are recommended to ensure long-term dependability.
