### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volvo XC70 demonstrates solid reliability, particularly in its exterior and interior components, where major issues are rarely reported. The powertrain, while generally robust, can occasionally present concerns such as turbocharger issues on the T5 engine, oil leaks on the 3.2L, and coolant leaks on the T6. Transmission problems, like hesitation or shuddering, are also noted, often requiring fluid services or more involved repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are the most common electrical faults. Suspension components like bushings and sway bar links may require attention as the vehicle ages. Overall, the XC70 is a dependable choice, but owners should be aware of these potential, albeit not universal, issues and budget accordingly for maintenance and potential repairs.
