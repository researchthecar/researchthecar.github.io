### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Volvo XC70 offers a compelling blend of utility and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The engines, particularly the turbocharged variants, can experience PCV system and turbocharger problems. Automatic transmissions may develop issues with solenoids or torque converters. Suspension components like control arm bushings and rear springs are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, often related to the CEM module or ABS/DSTC system, can be a significant concern. Interior issues like clogged sunroof drains are manageable but require attention. Despite these potential drawbacks, many XC70s remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, especially if these common failure points are addressed proactively.
