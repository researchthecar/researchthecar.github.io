The 2011 Volvo XC70 is a wagon known for its safety, comfort, and all-weather capability. Engine options included a 3.2L inline-6 naturally aspirated engine (240 hp and 236 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 engine (300 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the XC70's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and standard safety features. Common dislikes include the sometimes-lackluster fuel economy and some reported electrical issues.
