The 2016 Volvo XC70 is a versatile and comfortable wagon known for its safety, reliability, and spacious interior. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 (T5 Drive-E), and a 2.5L Turbocharged I5 (T5). The 2.0L T5 Drive-E produces 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque.

**Summary**

The 2016 Volvo XC70 generally holds up well, but some common issues can arise. Potential engine problems (particularly oil consumption in the 2.0L T5 Drive-E) and transmission issues (specifically with the 5-speed automatic) can be costly. Suspension and electrical problems also exist, though they are generally less prevalent. Buyers should inspect potential purchases carefully, paying attention to signs of these issues. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to significant repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
