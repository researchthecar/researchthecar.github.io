### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volvo XC70 is a capable and safe vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The engine, particularly the turbocharged 2.5L, can experience problems with the PCV system and turbocharger. Automatic transmissions, specifically the AW55-50SN, are prone to solenoid and torque converter failures. The AWD system's viscous coupling can also be a point of concern. Electrical issues, especially with the CEM module due to water ingress, are notable. While the exterior is generally robust, interior water leaks from clogged sunroof drains can occur. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these common problems, the XC70 can remain a reliable choice.
