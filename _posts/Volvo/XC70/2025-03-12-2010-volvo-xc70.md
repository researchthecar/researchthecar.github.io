The 2010 Volvo XC70 is a versatile and comfortable wagon known for its safety, practicality, and all-weather capability. It offered a blend of car-like handling with some SUV-like ground clearance. Engine options for this model year included a 3.2-liter inline-6 producing 235 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 generating 281 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque.
