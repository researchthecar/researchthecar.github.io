### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Volvo WG demonstrates a strong reliability profile, especially concerning its heavy-duty diesel engines and robust chassis. While specific issues like EGR cooler leaks and injector sleeve problems can arise with the D12F and D13F engines, they are generally repairable and not indicative of systemic failure. The transmission options, both manual and automated, are also well-regarded, with the I-Shift's clutch actuator being a notable, though manageable, repair. Suspension components, particularly air springs, may require attention due to wear, and frame corrosion is a concern in certain environments. Overall, the WG is a dependable workhorse, with most reported issues being typical for commercial vehicles of its age and intended use, rather than widespread design flaws.
