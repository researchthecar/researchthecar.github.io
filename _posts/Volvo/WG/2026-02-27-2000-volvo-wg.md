### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Volvo WG demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly in its core mechanical components. The diesel engines, while robust, can experience issues with turbochargers and EGR systems, which are common for high-mileage diesel vehicles. Automatic transmissions, specifically the AW55-50SN, may require attention to solenoids and torque converters. Manual transmissions are less prone to major issues beyond standard clutch wear. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks are typical wear items that may need replacement. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, can be a concern, as can alternator failures. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing specific known issues, the 2000 Volvo WG remains a dependable commercial vehicle.
