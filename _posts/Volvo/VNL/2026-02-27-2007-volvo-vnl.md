### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volvo VNL is a workhorse truck with a generally strong reliability record. Key areas that may require attention include the EGR cooler and fuel system components on Volvo engines, and VGT actuators or fuel pumps on Cummins engines. Transmission issues, particularly with automated manual systems like the I-Shift, can arise, often related to actuators or control modules. Suspension components, especially air springs, can develop leaks over time. Electrical system issues, such as wiring harness corrosion and alternator failures, are not uncommon in heavy-duty applications. While interior components like the HVAC system and driver's seat can experience wear, these are typically less critical to the truck's core operation. Proactive maintenance and timely repairs are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and minimizing downtime of the 2007 Volvo VNL.
