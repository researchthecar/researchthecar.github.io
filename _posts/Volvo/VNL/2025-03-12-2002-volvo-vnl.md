The 2002 Volvo VNL is a popular heavy-duty truck known for its comfortable cab and fuel efficiency. Engine options typically included the Cummins ISX and the Volvo D12, both inline-six diesel engines. The Cummins ISX came in various horsepower ratings, often around 400-500 hp, and significant torque, usually exceeding 1650 lb-ft. Transmission options mainly consisted of Eaton Fuller manual transmissions with 10 or 13 speeds, and some automatic transmissions were also available. Owners appreciate the VNL's spacious sleeper cab and relatively smooth ride for a Class 8 truck, but common complaints often revolve around the age of the vehicle and the associated maintenance costs and potential for breakdowns.

**Summary**

The 2002 Volvo VNL, while a generally reliable truck, is prone to age-related issues, with the engine, transmission, and electrical systems being the most common sources of problems. The Cummins ISX and Volvo D12 engines can experience injector failures and other age-related issues. Transmission problems with the Eaton Fuller units usually involve hard shifting or clutch failure. Electrical issues can range from minor sensor failures to more significant wiring harness problems. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the severity of the issue, from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. The age of the vehicle should be a large factor in considering a purchase of one of these units.
