### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volvo VNL demonstrates strong overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system and fuel delivery on larger diesel engines, as well as potential wear on automated transmission components like clutch actuators. Electrical system integrity, especially wiring harnesses, can be a concern over time due to environmental exposure. Suspension components, particularly air springs and height control valves, may require attention. However, many of these issues are not unique to Volvo and are common in the heavy-duty trucking industry. Proactive maintenance and addressing early warning signs are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and minimizing downtime of the 2017 VNL.
