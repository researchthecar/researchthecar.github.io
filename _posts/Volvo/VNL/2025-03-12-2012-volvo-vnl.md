The 2012 Volvo VNL is a popular Class 8 semi-truck known for its comfortable cab, fuel efficiency, and overall reliability. Common engine options include the Volvo D13, Cummins ISX15, and occasionally the Volvo D11. The Volvo D13 produces around 400-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Transmission options usually include the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission, as well as manual transmissions from Eaton. Drivers often praise the VNL for its smooth ride and ergonomic design, but some criticize the complexity of the Volvo electrical systems and the higher cost of Volvo-specific parts.

**Summary**
The 2012 Volvo VNL is a generally reliable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues with the EGR cooler, DPF, and fuel injectors on the engines. The I-Shift transmission can experience shift actuator and clutch problems. Electrical issues, particularly with wiring harnesses and sensors, are also relatively common. Suspension airbag and ride height sensor failures, as well as HVAC and gauge cluster issues, can also occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars depending on the problem. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the VNL's performance and longevity.
