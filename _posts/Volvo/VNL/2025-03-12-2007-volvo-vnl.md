The 2007 Volvo VNL is a popular Class 8 semi-truck known for its comfort, fuel efficiency, and durability. Engine options for this year include the Volvo D12, Volvo D13, and Cummins ISX15. The Volvo D13 engine produces between 400-500 horsepower and 1450-1750 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific configuration. The most common transmissions were the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission and Eaton Fuller manual transmissions. Owners often praise the VNL for its spacious cab, smooth ride, and overall reliability, while common complaints revolve around electrical issues, particularly with sensors and wiring, and occasional problems with the Volvo I-Shift transmission.

**Summary**

The 2007 Volvo VNL, while generally a reliable truck, does have some common issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly with the Volvo I-Shift and certain engine components like injectors and EGR valves, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, especially sensor failures and wiring issues, are also prevalent. Suspension and interior component failures, while less frequent, can still lead to unexpected repair bills. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can quickly escalate into significant expenses. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to maintaining the VNL's performance and longevity.
