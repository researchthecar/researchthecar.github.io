### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volvo VNL is a generally reliable heavy-duty truck, with most reported issues being specific to individual components rather than systemic failures. Common areas of concern include the EGR cooler and fuel injectors on Volvo engines, VGT turbos and camshafts on Cummins engines, and head gasket/injector sleeves on Detroit Diesel engines. Transmission issues can arise with clutch actuators or torque converters, particularly in automatic models. Suspension air springs and electrical wiring harness integrity are also points to monitor. While some repairs can be costly, proactive maintenance and addressing issues promptly can ensure the longevity and operational efficiency of the VNL.
