### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Volvo VNL demonstrates a generally strong reliability record, typical for a heavy-duty commercial vehicle designed for demanding use. The most frequently reported technical issues tend to be concentrated in the powertrain, specifically with EGR coolers, fuel injectors on Volvo engines, and DPF systems on Cummins engines. Transmission-related problems, particularly with automated manual transmissions like the I-Shift, can arise from actuator or module failures. Suspension components, especially air springs, are susceptible to leaks over time. Electrical system faults, such as wiring harness issues and alternator failures, are also noted. While these issues can lead to significant repair costs, proactive maintenance and timely diagnosis can mitigate most problems, ensuring the VNL remains a dependable workhorse.
