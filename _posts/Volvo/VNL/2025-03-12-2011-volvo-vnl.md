The 2011 Volvo VNL is a popular heavy-duty truck known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable cabin. Engine options for the 2011 VNL included the Volvo D13, Cummins ISX15, and Volvo D11. The Volvo D13, for example, produced around 400-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Transmission options typically included Eaton Fuller manual and automated manual transmissions. Owners often praise the VNL for its driver-friendly features and long-haul comfort, but some common complaints include electrical issues and occasional problems with emissions systems.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**
* **EGR Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption. Often caused by carbon buildup.
    * Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve. Cleaning the EGR valve *may* temporarily resolve the issue, but replacement is often necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, check engine light, reduced engine power, and potential engine shutdown. Can be caused by a clogged DPF.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration, cleaning the DPF, or replacement of the DPF.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (forced regen) - $4,000+ (DPF replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, reduced fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$1,000 per injector.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Cummins ISX15**

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, engine overheating.  The EGR cooler can develop leaks.
    * Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, whistling noises from the engine.
    * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Volvo D11**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**Eaton Fuller Automated Manual (Specific Models)**

* **Shift Solenoid Failure**

    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Clutch Actuator Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging or disengaging the clutch, transmission slipping, grinding noises.
    * Solution: Replacement or repair of the clutch actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Leaks**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights not working, gauges malfunctioning, or engine stalling.
    * Solution: Inspection and repair of damaged wiring harnesses. Can involve tracing wires and replacing connectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and location of the damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures (Various Sensors)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, various performance issues depending on the affected sensor (e.g., coolant temperature sensor, mass airflow sensor).
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor and subsequent replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary**
The 2011 Volvo VNL, while generally reliable, can experience several common issues. Engine-related problems, particularly with the D13 and Cummins ISX15, often involve emissions components like the EGR valve, DPF, and EGR cooler. Electrical issues, such as wiring harness damage and sensor failures, are also prevalent. Suspension and transmission issues, such as air leaks and shift solenoid failures, can also be a concern. The severity and cost of these issues can vary significantly depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage. Engine and emissions related issues are the most expensive to fix, followed by transmission issues.
