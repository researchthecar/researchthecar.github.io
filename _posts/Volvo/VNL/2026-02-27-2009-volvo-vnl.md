### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volvo VNL is a workhorse truck with a generally solid reputation for reliability. The most common reported technical issues tend to be concentrated in the powertrain, specifically with EGR systems, fuel injectors, and turbochargers on the D13 engine, and clutch actuators or TCMs for the I-Shift transmission. Suspension components, particularly air springs, can also develop leaks over time. Electrical gremlins, such as wiring harness corrosion and alternator failures, are not uncommon in heavy-duty applications. While interior and exterior components are generally durable, issues like HVAC blower motor failures and frame corrosion can arise. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble are key to maximizing the longevity and minimizing downtime of the 2009 Volvo VNL.
