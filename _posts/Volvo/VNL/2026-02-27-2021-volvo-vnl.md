### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Volvo VNL generally exhibits strong reliability, consistent with Volvo's reputation in the heavy-duty truck market. Major powertrain components like the D11, D13, and D16 engines, along with the I-Shift and Eaton Fuller transmissions, show no widespread reported issues, indicating robust engineering and build quality. Areas that may require attention over time include suspension components, particularly air springs, which can develop leaks, and electrical systems where wiring harness integrity and control module software can be points of failure. Exterior and interior components are largely reliable, with isolated reports of LED lighting issues or HVAC blower motor problems. Proactive maintenance and timely addressing of minor electrical or suspension concerns are recommended for optimal long-term performance and to mitigate potential downtime.
