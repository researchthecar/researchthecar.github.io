The 2016 Volvo VNL is a popular choice for long-haul truckers, known for its comfortable ride, spacious cab, and fuel efficiency. Engine options include the Volvo D11, Volvo D13, and Cummins ISX15. For example, the Volvo D13 engine produces between 405 and 500 horsepower and up to 1850 lb-ft of torque. Common complaints about the VNL often revolve around the complexity of the electrical systems and the cost of replacement parts. Drivers generally appreciate the comfortable interior and smooth ride but sometimes express frustration with the diagnostic procedures required for repairs. Transmission options include Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission.

**Summary**

The 2016 Volvo VNL, while offering a comfortable and efficient driving experience, can be prone to several issues. Engine problems, particularly with the EGR cooler and fuel injectors in the Volvo D13, and DPF systems and EGR Valves in the Cummins ISX15, can result in high repair costs. Transmission issues, especially with the I-Shift's shift actuators, are also common. Electrical problems, including wiring harness and sensor failures, are frequently reported. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls. While some issues may be relatively minor, others can significantly impact the vehicle's reliability and operational costs.
