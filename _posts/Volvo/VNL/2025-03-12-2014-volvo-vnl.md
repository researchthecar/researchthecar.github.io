The 2014 Volvo VNL is a popular Class 8 semi-truck known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable cabin, and relatively smooth ride. Engine options for this year include the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX15. The D13 engine, a very common choice, produces between 405 and 500 horsepower and up to 1850 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission, as well as manual transmissions from Eaton Fuller. Drivers often praise the VNL for its driver-friendly features and long-haul comfort, but common complaints revolve around the cost of maintenance, specific electrical issues, and some concerns with the reliability of certain components, particularly related to emissions systems.

**Summary**

The 2014 Volvo VNL, while generally a reliable truck, does experience some common issues. The most prevalent issues often revolve around the emissions system (EGR, DPF) on both the Volvo D13 and Cummins ISX15 engines, which can lead to significant repair costs. The I-Shift transmission can also present challenges with shift actuators and the TCM. Electrical issues, particularly with wiring and sensors, are also relatively common. Overall, while major mechanical failures aren't rampant, the cumulative cost of addressing these issues can be significant, particularly as the trucks age. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs.
