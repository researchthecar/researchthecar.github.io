The 2018 Volvo VNL is a popular semi-truck known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable cab, and safety features. Common engine options include the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins X15. The Volvo D13 engine, for example, produces between 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Drivers often appreciate the VNL's smooth ride and ergonomic interior, but some have expressed concerns about the complexity of the electronics and the cost of repairs. Transmission options include the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission and manual transmissions.

**Summary**

The 2018 Volvo VNL, while generally reliable, can experience issues across various systems. Engine-related problems, particularly with the DPF and EGR system in the D13, and fuel injectors and water pumps on the Cummins X15, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues with the I-Shift can also be expensive to address. Electrical issues and problems with the suspension and HVAC system contribute to overall maintenance costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major breakdowns, with repair costs spanning from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's service history before making a purchase.
