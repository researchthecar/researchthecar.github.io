    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Eaton Fuller Manual Transmissions (All Models)**

* **Shift Fork Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, grinding noises, and popping out of gear. Worn or broken shift forks prevent proper gear engagement.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected shift fork(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Clutch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, and complete loss of drive. Wear and tear on the clutch disc, pressure plate, or throwout bearing.
    * Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Eaton Fuller Automated Manual Transmissions (All Models)**

* **Shift Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, erratic shifting behavior, and error codes. The shift actuator is responsible for selecting gears automatically.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty shift actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, no shifting, error codes. The TCM controls the automated shifting functions.
    * Solution: TCM reprogramming or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, ride height issues, air compressor running constantly. Leaks often occur at air bags, fittings, or air lines.

**Summary**

The 2005 Volvo VNL, while generally a reliable truck, can experience several common issues. Engine issues, particularly with the Cummins ISX and Volvo D12, often involve EGR coolers, injectors, and cylinder heads, leading to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, regardless of the specific model, can stem from shift fork wear, actuator failures, and TCM issues. Electrical problems and air suspension leaks can also contribute to maintenance expenses. While some repairs are relatively minor, others can be costly, potentially ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for maintaining the VNL's performance and preventing more extensive damage.
