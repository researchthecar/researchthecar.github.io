The 2009 Volvo VNL is a popular Class 8 semi-truck known for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and durable construction. Engine options commonly include the Volvo D13, Cummins ISX, and Caterpillar C13, offering a range of horsepower and torque options. For example, the Volvo D13 offers approximately 400-500 horsepower and 1450-1750 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific tuning. Common transmission options are the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission, Eaton Fuller manual transmissions, and Eaton Ultrashift automated manual transmissions. Drivers often appreciate the VNL's spacious cab and ergonomic design, while some dislike the complexity of the electrical systems and the cost of certain replacement parts.

**Summary:**

The 2009 Volvo VNL is a reliable truck, but owners may encounter issues related to the engine (specifically injector cups and EGR coolers on the D13, injectors and turbos on the ISX, and HEUI pumps and oil coolers on the C13), transmission (clutch actuator and gear position sensors on the I-Shift, shift forks and synchronizers on the Eaton Fuller manuals, and valve body and TCM issues on the Ultrashift), suspension (air spring leaks and ride height sensor failure), and electrical systems (multiplexing system and alternator failure). The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars depending on the problem and the specific repair needed.
