The 2022 Volvo VNL is a popular choice for long-haul trucking, known for its fuel efficiency, driver comfort, and safety features. Engine options for the 2022 VNL include the Volvo D11, D13, and D16 engines, offering a range of horsepower and torque to suit different hauling needs. The D13 engine, a particularly popular choice, delivers up to 500 horsepower and 1850 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically consist of Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Drivers often praise the VNL for its comfortable cab, smooth ride, and advanced safety systems. Common complaints often revolve around the complexity of the electronics, leading to occasional diagnostic challenges, and the cost of Volvo-specific parts and maintenance.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, white smoke from exhaust, overheating. EGR cooler fails internally, allowing coolant to enter the exhaust stream.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, black smoke. Fuel injectors may become clogged or fail due to fuel quality or wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). May require recalibration after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ per injector
    * Recalls: None Found

**Volvo D11**
*No Issues Found*

**Volvo D16**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift**

*   **Shift Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, erratic shifting, transmission stuck in gear. Shift actuators control gear selection within the I-Shift transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift actuator. May require software update or recalibration after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, shuddering during takeoff. High mileage or aggressive driving can accelerate clutch wear in the I-Shift.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch assembly. Recommended to replace the throwout bearing and pilot bearing at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaning to one side, rough ride, hissing sound from air leaks. Air springs in the suspension system can develop leaks or rupture.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per air spring
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Ride Height Sensor Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Incorrect ride height, suspension not leveling, warning lights. Sensors provide feedback to the suspension control system.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ride height sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, various fault codes, drivability issues. Various sensors throughout the vehicle, such as NOx sensors, particulate matter (PM) sensors, and temperature sensors are prone to failure.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor and replace it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1000+ depending on the sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, short circuits, difficulty diagnosing issues. Wiring harnesses can suffer from chafing, corrosion, or loose connections.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair/replace damaged sections of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the repair. This can be higher due to diagnostic time.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing. Can reduce headlight effectiveness and potentially damage the bulb or electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replace the headlight assembly or attempt to reseal the existing unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per headlight
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent temperature control, inability to direct airflow properly, clicking noises from the dashboard. HVAC actuators control the blend doors and airflow direction.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty HVAC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per actuator
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Volvo VNL is a generally reliable truck, but owners have reported some issues with the D13 engine, the I-Shift transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. EGR cooler and fuel injector issues seem to be the most prevalent for the D13 engines. Clutch and shift actuator failures are common with the I-Shift. While some issues, such as HVAC actuator failure, can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as engine or transmission repairs, can be quite costly. It is important to note that many of these issues are related to high mileage or demanding operating conditions. Regular maintenance and careful driving habits can help to mitigate these problems.
