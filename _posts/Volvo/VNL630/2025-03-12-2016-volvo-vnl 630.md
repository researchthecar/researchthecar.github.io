The 2016 Volvo VNL 630 is a popular choice for long-haul trucking, known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable cab, and relatively aerodynamic design. Engine options for the 2016 VNL 630 include the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX15 (depending on the specific year and configuration). The Volvo D13 engine, for example, could produce between 405 to 500 horsepower and 1450 to 1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Transmissions are typically Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission, or manual transmissions depending on the configuration. Drivers often praise the VNL 630 for its ride quality and spacious sleeper berth. Common dislikes include some of the electronic systems' complexity and the cost of some replacement parts.

**Engine**

    *   Solution: Fuel injector cleaning or replacement. Check fuel quality and fuel filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Cummins ISX15**

*   **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, black smoke from the exhaust, engine knocking, and potential engine damage. The EGR valve becomes stuck or fails to open/close properly.
    *   Solution: EGR valve cleaning or replacement. Inspect the EGR cooler and other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, unusual noises from the turbocharger, and potential engine damage. The turbocharger bearings fail or the turbocharger blades become damaged.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Inspect the oil supply line to the turbocharger for blockage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Shift Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, erratic shifting, transmission slipping, and potential transmission failure. The shift actuator motor or sensors fail.
    *   Solution: Shift actuator replacement. Check the transmission wiring harness for damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
