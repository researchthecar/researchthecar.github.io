**Summary**

The 2015 Volvo VNL 630 is a solid truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the DPF, EGR valve, and I-Shift transmission. Cummins ISX15 engines may experience camshaft and turbocharger issues. Electrical problems can also be a headache due to the complexity of the system. Suspension and interior issues, such as air spring failures and HVAC problems, are also relatively common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls. While there are no recalls currently listed for these issues, regular maintenance and careful monitoring of the truck's performance can help prevent costly breakdowns.
