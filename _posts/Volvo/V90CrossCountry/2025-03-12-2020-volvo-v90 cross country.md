The 2020 Volvo V90 Cross Country is a luxury wagon known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and elegant design. Most 2020 V90 Cross Country models were equipped with a turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some earlier models may have a T5 engine option available as well. Owners generally appreciate the V90 Cross Country's sophisticated styling, comfortable seating, and advanced safety features. However, some common complaints include the complexity of the infotainment system, occasional software glitches, and the high cost of maintenance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged Inline-4 (T6)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. The amount of oil consumed may vary.
    *   Solution: The dealer should perform an oil consumption test to determine if the vehicle is consuming oil at an excessive rate. If confirmed, the common fix is typically the replacement of the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair and if the engine needs to be removed)

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Aisin Warner TG-81SC)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifting, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or hesitation when the transmission shifts gears.
    *   Solution: The dealer may attempt to reprogram the transmission control module (TCM) with updated software. If the issue persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may be recommended. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update ($100 - $200), Fluid flush and filter change ($300 - $500), Valve body replacement ($1,500 - $3,000+), Transmission rebuild ($3,000 - $6,000+)

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system is prone to freezing, crashing, or exhibiting slow response times. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer is the first step. If the issue persists, a hard reset of the system may be necessary. In some cases, the infotainment system module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (typically free or included in service), Infotainment module replacement ($1,000 - $2,000+)

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions of parking sensors or the blind spot monitoring system, resulting in false alerts or the system not functioning at all.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific sensor that is malfunctioning. Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor, depending on location and accessibility.

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues (Sticking, Squeaking)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may stick when opening or closing, or may produce squeaking or rattling noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the sunroof tracks and seals. In more severe cases, sunroof motor replacement or adjustment of the sunroof mechanism may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lubrication ($50 - $100), Motor replacement ($300 - $700+)

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, failure to maintain ride height, or compressor malfunction. This is only relevant to V90 Cross Countrys equipped with the optional air suspension.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the air suspension system, including inspection of air struts, compressor, and air lines for leaks. Replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air strut replacement ($800 - $1500+ per strut), Compressor replacement ($600 - $1200+)

**Recalls**

The 2020 Volvo V90 Cross Country, while appreciated for its luxury and practicality, has some common issues. The most concerning are the potential engine oil consumption and transmission problems which could lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and sensors can be frustrating, though generally less expensive to resolve. Air suspension problems, if equipped, can also be costly.
