The 2017 Volvo V90 Cross Country is a luxury wagon known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and distinctive Scandinavian design. It came standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder engine (T6) producing 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While owners often praise its elegant styling, comfortable seats, and advanced safety features, some common criticisms include the complex infotainment system and the potential for electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged Inline-4 (T6)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by a low oil warning light, noticeable blue smoke from the exhaust, or an unexplained drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Addressing excessive oil consumption can involve several steps, starting with checking for leaks. If no leaks are found, a compression test and leak-down test can help identify potential internal engine issues, such as worn piston rings or valve seals. In some cases, replacing these components or even a short block replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks may be apparent when there is a noticeable drop in the coolant level, coolant smell, or visible leaks under the vehicle. Overheating can occur if there are coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Coolant leaks should be inspected for damaged hoses, clamps, and the water pump. Replacement of these parts will solve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin Warner 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop is also reported.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may be necessary. For more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: V90 Cross Country models equipped with the optional air suspension can experience issues with the air compressor, air struts, or air lines. Symptoms include the car sitting unevenly, a warning light on the dashboard, or a noisy air compressor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the air suspension system for leaks and testing the functionality of the air compressor. Faulty air struts or a failing air compressor will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,500+ for the compressor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus Connect infotainment system in the 2017 V90 Cross Country can be prone to glitches, including screen freezes, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and navigation problems.
    *   Solution: Often, a software update can resolve these issues. Resetting the system or performing a "soft reset" may also help. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing unexplained battery drain, particularly if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Determining the source of the battery drain can involve testing the charging system and checking for parasitic draws. A faulty alternator, a malfunctioning module, or aftermarket accessories can contribute to battery drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the sunroof, including difficulty opening or closing, unusual noises, or leaks.
    *   Solution: The sunroof mechanism should be inspected for obstructions, debris, or worn components. Lubricating the tracks and seals may help. If necessary, the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the specific issue and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front seat heaters may fail or only partially heat. This is often caused by a break in the heating element within the seat.
    *   Solution: The heating element will need to be located and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Volvo V90 Cross Country offers a luxurious and comfortable driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The most frequent complaints involve the infotainment system, potential oil consumption issues with the engine, and the air suspension (if equipped). Repair costs can range from minor software updates to more substantial engine or suspension work. While these issues are not present in every vehicle, a thorough inspection and pre-purchase diagnostic check are highly recommended to avoid unexpected expenses.
