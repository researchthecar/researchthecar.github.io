The 2018 Volvo V90 Cross Country is a stylish and capable wagon that blends luxury with all-weather practicality. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder engine (T6) producing 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an Aisin 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the V90 Cross Country for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and elegant design. Common criticisms include the complex infotainment system and higher-than-average repair costs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged I4 (T6)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add a quart of oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The specific cause of the consumption varies and can require multiple repairs and/or tests. Some owners have reported successful outcomes with new PCV valves, or piston rings if it is determined the consumption is originating inside the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks in the plastic coolant pipe that runs to the turbocharger can occur. Owners report seeing pink or green coolant dripping onto the ground near the front of the engine, or smelling coolant when the engine is hot. A low coolant warning light on the dash can also be triggered.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked plastic coolant pipe with a new redesigned component, preferably an updated version that is more resistant to cracking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin AW TG-81SC 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or delayed shifts, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or "jerk" during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop is also a complaint.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) are often the first step. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and fill can resolve the issue. For more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension, if equipped, can experience leaks or compressor failures. This leads to the vehicle sitting lower in the rear, a noticeably bouncy ride, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air springs or the air compressor. Also, checking and repairing any leaks in the air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues (Sensus)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system is known to be slow, buggy, and prone to freezing or crashing. Owners report issues with the touchscreen responsiveness, navigation system, and Bluetooth connectivity.
    *   Solution: Software updates are frequently released to address these issues. However, some problems may persist even after updates. In severe cases, the infotainment module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $1,500+ (for module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car's battery draining quickly, especially if the car is left sitting for several days. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic draw is key. This can involve testing individual circuits and modules to pinpoint the component that is drawing excessive current. In some cases, a faulty module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks in the sunroof drains can clog and leak water into the interior, leading to wet carpets and headliners.
    *   Solution: Clearing the sunroof drain tubes and verifying the integrity of the sunroof seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters may fail to function properly, either not heating at all or only heating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the seat heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Volvo V90 Cross Country offers a compelling blend of luxury, utility, and style. However, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues reported by owners. Electrical problems, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, appear to be the most frequently encountered. Engine and transmission issues, while less common, can be more costly to repair. The air suspension is also something to consider if equipped. Overall, while the issues aren't overwhelmingly widespread, they are present and could lead to expensive repairs. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended.
