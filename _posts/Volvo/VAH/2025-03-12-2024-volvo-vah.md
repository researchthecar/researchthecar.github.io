The 2024 Volvo VAH is a versatile vocational truck known for its robust construction, driver comfort, and advanced safety features. It's primarily designed for heavy-duty applications like construction, refuse, and logging. The VAH is typically powered by a Volvo D11, D13, or D16 engine paired with a Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission. The D13 engine, a popular choice, delivers around 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific configuration. Owners often praise its fuel efficiency, quiet operation, and ergonomic cab design. Some common complaints include the complexity of the electronics systems, the cost of replacement parts, and the occasional issue with sensor failures.
