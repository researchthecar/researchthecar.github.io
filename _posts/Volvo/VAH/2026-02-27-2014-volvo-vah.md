### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Volvo VAH demonstrates strong overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and chassis components, which are built for heavy-duty service. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the complex emissions systems (EGR coolers), fuel delivery (injectors), and automated transmission control modules, which are common across modern heavy-duty trucks. Electrical gremlins and specific component failures like alternators can occur but are not indicative of systemic design flaws. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning the EGR system and regular fluid changes, is crucial for maximizing the longevity and minimizing downtime of the VAH.
