### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volvo VAH demonstrates solid reliability, particularly in its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The D11 and D13 engines have some documented issues like EGR cooler leaks and fuel injector problems, which are not uncommon in heavy-duty diesel applications and can be costly to repair. The I-Shift transmission, while generally robust, can experience issues with its clutch actuator and software. Suspension components, especially air springs, can develop leaks over time. Electrical system issues, often related to wiring harness wear, are also a possibility in a commercial vehicle environment. Overall, the VAH is a dependable truck, but owners should be aware of potential maintenance needs for the EGR system, fuel system, and transmission actuators to ensure optimal performance and longevity.
