The 2017 Volvo VAH is a heavy-duty truck primarily used for long-haul transportation. While specific horsepower and torque figures vary based on configuration (engine, axle ratio, etc.) its D13 engine is popular and produces around 425-500 horsepower and over 1750 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise its comfortable cab, fuel efficiency, and safety features. Common complaints include the complexity of the electronics and the cost of repairs. It is available with a variety of engine options, including the D11 and D13, and a variety of transmissions including Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission.

**D13**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks often originate from the water pump, radiator hoses, or the EGR cooler. Symptoms include a low coolant warning light, visible coolant leaks, and engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty component (water pump, hose, or EGR cooler).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve can become clogged or fail, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, increased emissions, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve and cleaning of related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Volvo VAH, while praised for its comfort and efficiency, can present owners with a range of issues. Engine problems, particularly with the D13 (coolant leaks, EGR valve failure) and D11 (DPF issues), are prevalent. The I-Shift transmission can also experience shifting problems and clutch failures. Electrical problems and suspension issues can add to the cost of ownership. Severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying widely depending on the specific problem. Due to the complexity of the vehicle, diagnostics and repairs often require specialized equipment and expertise. While some issues might be relatively inexpensive to fix, others can lead to substantial repair bills.
