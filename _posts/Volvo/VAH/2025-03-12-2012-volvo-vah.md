The 2012 Volvo VAH is a heavy-duty truck designed for vocational applications like construction, refuse, and heavy hauling. Engine options for this model year included the Volvo D11, D13, and D16 engines. Available transmissions were typically Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the VAH for its durability, strong chassis, and driver comfort. Common complaints often revolve around the cost of maintenance and specialized parts, as well as some specific issues related to the emissions systems and the automated manual transmission.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, white smoke from the exhaust, decreased engine performance, and potential engine overheating. The EGR cooler is prone to cracking due to thermal stress.
    * Solution: Replacing the EGR cooler.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Plugging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, and eventually a complete engine shutdown. The DPF can become clogged with soot and ash, especially in stop-and-go applications.
    * Solution: DPF cleaning or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Volvo D16**

* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust. Fuel injectors can fail due to wear, contamination, or electrical issues.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift**

* **Shift Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, erratic shifting behavior, or complete transmission failure. The shift actuators are responsible for selecting gears within the I-Shift transmission, and they can fail due to wear or electrical problems.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty shift actuator(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Clutch Wear and Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, and eventually complete clutch failure. Heavy use and improper driving habits can accelerate clutch wear in the I-Shift transmission.
    * Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Component Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, excessive air compressor operation, and a rough ride. Air bags, leveling valves, and air lines can develop leaks over time.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sensor Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs), and various performance issues. Sensors related to engine, transmission, and emissions control can fail, leading to a wide range of problems.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty sensor(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, gauges not working, or engine stalling. Wiring harnesses can become damaged due to chafing, corrosion, or heat exposure.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the damaged wiring harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Assembly Cracking/Fogging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Headlights becoming cloudy or cracked, reducing visibility at night. The plastic headlight lenses can become brittle over time due to UV exposure.
    * Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per assembly
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Control Module Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inability to control temperature, fan speed, or airflow direction. The HVAC control module can fail due to electrical issues or wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the HVAC control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Volvo VAH, while a robust and capable truck, is prone to certain issues. Engine-related problems, particularly concerning the EGR system and DPF, are common and can be expensive to address. The I-Shift transmission can experience issues with shift actuators and clutch wear, also leading to significant repair costs. Electrical problems and suspension component leaks can also arise. While the severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on usage and maintenance, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems.
