### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Volvo VAH demonstrates a solid reliability record, particularly in its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The D13 and D11 engines, while robust, can experience issues like EGR cooler leaks and turbocharger problems, which are not uncommon in heavy-duty diesel applications. The I-Shift transmission is generally reliable, but clutch actuator issues and software glitches can arise. Suspension components, especially air springs and height control valves, are areas to monitor for potential leaks or malfunctions. Electrical system integrity, particularly wiring harnesses, is crucial for preventing intermittent faults. Overall, the VAH is a dependable truck, but proactive maintenance and awareness of these potential issues can significantly mitigate downtime and repair costs for fleet operators.
