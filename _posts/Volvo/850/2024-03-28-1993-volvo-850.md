**Introduction:**

The 1993 Volvo 850 is a mid-size luxury sedan that was available with inline-five or inline-six engines paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The inline-five engine produces 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, while the inline-six engine produces 190 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. The 850 is known for its safety features, spacious interior, and comfortable ride, but it has also been plagued by some common issues.

### **Engine**

**Inline-Five Engine**

- **Oil leaks:** Leaking valve cover gaskets and camshaft seals are common, leading to oil buildup and a burning smell in the engine bay.
- **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt can fail prematurely, causing catastrophic engine damage.
- **Intake manifold gasket failure:** A leaking intake manifold gasket can cause the engine to run rough or stall.

**Inline-Six Engine**

- **Oil consumption:** Excessive oil consumption is a common issue, requiring frequent top-offs.
- **Vacuum leaks:** Vacuum leaks in the intake system can cause the engine to run lean and misfire.
- **Coolant leaks:** Coolant leaks from the water pump or heater core can lead to overheating.

### **Transmission**

**Five-Speed Manual Transmission**

- **Gear grinding:** Difficulty shifting gears can be caused by worn synchronizers or a faulty clutch.
- **Clutch failure:** The clutch may wear out prematurely, especially if the vehicle is used for towing or hard driving.

**Four-Speed Automatic Transmission**

- **Shifting issues:** Rough shifting or delayed shifts can indicate a faulty transmission control module or solenoid.
- **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip or shudder when shifting gears, usually due to worn clutch plates.

### **Suspension**

- **Strut mounts:** Worn strut mounts can cause clunking noises and a rough ride.
- **Sway bar end links:** Broken or loose sway bar end links can cause knocking or rattling sounds when driving over bumps.
- **Ball joints:** Worn ball joints can lead to imprecise handling and uneven tire wear.

### **Electrical**

- **Alternator failure:** The alternator may fail, resulting in a loss of electrical power and difficulty starting the vehicle.
- **Battery drain:** Parasitic battery drain can occur due to faulty components or accessories.
- **ABS module failure:** The ABS module may malfunction, causing the ABS system to become inoperative.

### **Exterior**

- **Tailgate rust:** The tailgate is prone to rusting, especially around the license plate area and window seal.
- **Headlight condensation:** Condensation can build up inside the headlights, impairing visibility.
- **Door handle failure:** The exterior door handles may become loose or fall off, making it difficult to open the doors.

### **Interior**

- **Dashboard cracking:** The dashboard can develop cracks over time, especially on sun-damaged vehicles.
- **Air conditioning issues:** The air conditioning system may not blow cold air due to a faulty compressor or condenser.
- **Window switch failure:** The window switches can fail, preventing the windows from being rolled up or down.

### **Summary**

Overall, the 1993 Volvo 850 is a generally reliable car, but it has its share of common issues. Engine and transmission problems can be expensive to fix, while electrical and suspension issues are usually less severe. Interior issues are primarily cosmetic but can still be annoying. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchase decision.
