The 2020 Volvo XC60 is a compact luxury SUV praised for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and comprehensive suite of safety features. Engine options included the T5, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque; the T6, a supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder generating 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque; and the T8 eAWD Plug-In Hybrid, a supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with an electric motor producing a combined 400 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque. All engine options are paired with an Aisin Warner 8-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the XC60's refined driving experience and elegant design, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's complexity, occasional electronic glitches, and higher repair costs compared to non-luxury vehicles.
