### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volvo VT generally exhibits good reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and chassis components, which are built for heavy-duty service. However, like any commercial vehicle, specific issues can arise. The D13 and D11 engines may experience EGR cooler leaks or fuel injector problems, while the I-Shift transmission can have actuator or TCM faults. Suspension components, especially air springs, are prone to leaks over time. Electrical system issues often stem from wiring harness wear and tear. Regular preventative maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and minimizing downtime of a 2007 Volvo VT.
