The 2010 Volvo XC60 marked Volvo's entry into the compact luxury SUV segment. It was offered with a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 engine (T6) producing 281 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, coupled with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciated the XC60's distinctive Scandinavian design, comfortable seats, and focus on safety.
