**Summary**

The 2007 Volvo XC90 can be a comfortable and safe vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine issues such as timing chain problems (3.2L), turbocharger failure (2.5L), and alternator failures (4.4L) can be costly. Transmission issues, particularly valve body problems, affect all engine variants. Suspension problems, especially with the air suspension (if equipped), can also be expensive to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as sunroof drain clogs and DIM failures, can also occur. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant repair bills. Pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended.
