**Introduction:**

The 1998 Volvo FE is a medium-duty truck that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The most popular engine option was the 9-liter inline-6 diesel engine that produced 250 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque. The FE was also available with a 10-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The FE was known for its reliability and durability, but it was also known for some common problems.

**Engine Issues:**

**9-liter Inline-6 Diesel**

* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail due to a lack of lubrication or a faulty wastegate. Symptoms include a loss of power, increased exhaust smoke, and a whistling noise from the engine. The turbocharger can be replaced for $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Fuel injector failure:** The fuel injectors can fail due to contamination or a faulty electrical connection. Symptoms include a rough idle, decreased fuel economy, and a loss of power. The fuel injectors can be replaced for $500 - $1,000+.
* ** EGR valve failure:** The EGR valve can fail due to a buildup of carbon deposits or a faulty actuator. Symptoms include increased emissions, a loss of power, and a rough idle. The EGR valve can be replaced for $300 - $500+.

**Transmission Issues:**

**10-speed Manual Transmission**

* **Shifting difficulty:** The transmission may be difficult to shift into or out of gear. Symptoms include grinding or popping noises when shifting, and a lack of response from the transmission. The transmission may need to be rebuilt for $1,500 - $2,500+.

**6-speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Slipping:** The transmission may slip between gears. Symptoms include a loss of power, a rough ride, and increased fuel consumption. The transmission may need to be rebuilt for $2,000 - $3,000+.
* **No reverse:** The transmission may not engage in reverse gear. Symptoms include a lack of response from the transmission when reverse is selected. The transmission may need to be replaced for $3,000 - $5,000+.

**Suspension Issues:**

* **Leaf spring failure:** The leaf springs can fail due to overloading or excessive wear and tear. Symptoms include a sagging rear end, a rough ride, and difficulty steering. The leaf springs can be replaced for $500 - $1,000+.
* **Shock absorber failure:** The shock absorbers can fail due to wear and tear or a lack of lubrication. Symptoms include a rough ride, increased body roll, and decreased stability. The shock absorbers can be replaced for $200 - $400+.

**Electrical Issues:**

* **Battery drain:** The battery can drain prematurely due to a faulty alternator or a parasitic draw. Symptoms include difficulty starting the engine, dim headlights, and a dead battery. The alternator or parasitic draw can be replaced for $500 - $1,000+.
* **Electrical short:** An electrical short can occur due to a faulty wire or a loose connection. Symptoms include blown fuses, flickering lights, and a burning smell. The electrical short can be repaired for $200 - $500+.

**Exterior Issues:**

* **Rust:** The body of the FE can rust over time, especially in areas that are exposed to salt or moisture. Symptoms include bubbling paint, rust spots, and holes in the body panels. The rust can be repaired for $500 - $1,500+.

**Interior Issues:**

* **Dashboard cracking:** The dashboard can crack due to exposure to sunlight or extreme temperatures. Symptoms include cracks in the dashboard, peeling paint, and a warped dashboard. The dashboard can be replaced for $500 - $1,000+.
* **Loose door panels:** The door panels can become loose due to worn-out clips or a lack of adhesive. Symptoms include rattling noises from the door panels, and a lack of alignment between the door panels and the dashboard. The door panels can be tightened for $100 - $200+.

**Summary:**

Overall, the 1998 Volvo FE is a reliable and durable truck, but it is not without its problems. The most common issues include turbocharger failure, fuel injector failure, EGR valve failure, shifting difficulty, slipping, no reverse, leaf spring failure, shock absorber failure, battery drain, electrical shorts, rust, dashboard cracking, and loose door panels. The severity of these issues varies, but many of them can be repaired for a reasonable cost.
