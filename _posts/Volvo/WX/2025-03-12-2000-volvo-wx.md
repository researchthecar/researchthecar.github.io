**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-5 (B5244S)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, often originating from the rear main seal, valve cover gasket, or oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Thoroughly clean the affected area to ensure proper sealing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) system can become clogged, leading to increased crankcase pressure, oil leaks, and rough running. A whistling sound from the engine bay can also be an indicator.
    *   Solution: Replace the PCV valve, hoses, and possibly the oil trap.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+

    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to age and mileage, the V70's suspension components are prone to wear. This includes ball joints, control arm bushings, and struts/shocks. Symptoms include clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension components. A full suspension refresh may be necessary on high-mileage vehicles.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on components replaced)

**Summary:** The 2000 Volvo V70, while generally reliable, does suffer from age-related issues. Engine oil leaks and transmission problems are among the more costly concerns. Electrical issues, particularly with the ABS module and instrument cluster, are also common. Suspension wear is expected for a vehicle of this age. Addressing these issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to more significant repairs, potentially impacting the overall ownership cost.
