The 2003 Volvo XC90 marked Volvo's entry into the SUV market, offering a blend of safety, practicality, and Scandinavian design. Engine options included a 2.5L turbocharged inline-5 (208 hp, 236 lb-ft of torque), a 2.9L twin-turbocharged inline-6 (268 hp, 280 lb-ft of torque), and later a 4.4L V8. All engine options were paired with an automatic transmission. Owners often praised the XC90 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for safety. Common complaints include higher repair costs compared to some other SUVs and issues related to the electronic systems.
