The 2002 Volvo S60 was a significant model for Volvo, marking a new design direction. Common engine options included the 2.4L inline-5 producing 168 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque, the 2.4L turbo inline-5 producing 197 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque, and the high-performance 2.3L turbo inline-5 in the T5 model making 247 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the S60 for its safety, comfortable seats, and distinctive Scandinavian design. Downsides often cited include repair costs, some electrical quirks, and a somewhat firm ride.
