The 2008 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty vocational truck designed for demanding applications like construction, logging, and refuse hauling. Engine options for the 2008 VHD included the Volvo D11, D13, and D16 engines, all inline six-cylinder diesels. The D13 produced up to 500 horsepower and 1850 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were typically Eaton Fuller manual transmissions or Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the VHD's durability, robust construction, and comfortable (for a vocational truck) cab. Common complaints often revolve around the cost of parts and specialized maintenance required for heavy-duty trucks.
