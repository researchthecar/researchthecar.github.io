**Summary:**

While the Volvo VHD is generally a reliable and durable truck, it is not immune to issues. Turbocharger and EGR valve failures on the D12C engine, clutch and transmission control module (TCM) problems, and suspension components can cause significant downtime and repair costs. Electrical issues and exterior rust can also be concerns, while interior rattles and HVAC system failures can be annoying but less severe.
