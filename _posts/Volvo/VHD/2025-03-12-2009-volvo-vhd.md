The 2009 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty vocational truck designed for a variety of applications, including construction, refuse, and hauling. Engine options included the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX series. The Volvo D13 engine, a popular choice, produces around 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Transmission options were primarily Eaton Fuller manual transmissions, but automated manual transmissions (AMT) like Volvo's I-Shift were also available. Owners often appreciate the VHD for its robust build quality, driver comfort, and safety features. Common dislikes include potential maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty trucks and complexity in some of the newer automated systems.

**Summary**

The 2009 Volvo VHD can experience a range of issues, from relatively minor electrical faults to more significant engine and transmission problems. Engine issues, particularly related to the EGR system and fuel injectors in both Volvo and Cummins engines, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the I-Shift AMT, may also require specialized attention. Suspension and other systems can present repair costs that should be taken into consideration as well. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these vehicles and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified heavy-duty mechanic to assess the condition of critical components.
