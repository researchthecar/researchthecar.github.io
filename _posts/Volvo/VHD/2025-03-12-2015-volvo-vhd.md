The 2015 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty truck designed for vocational applications like construction, refuse hauling, and concrete mixing. It was available with several engine and transmission options. Common engine choices include the Volvo D11, D13, and D16, offering a range of horsepower and torque outputs. For example, the Volvo D13 produces up to 500 horsepower and 1850 lb-ft of torque. Drivers often appreciate the VHD's robust build, driver comfort, and safety features. However, some common dislikes include potential issues with the complex aftertreatment systems and the higher cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**
*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, DPF warning light illumination. Caused by soot buildup in the DPF.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2015 Volvo VHD, while generally a reliable heavy-duty truck, can experience issues across various systems. Engine-related problems like DPF clogging and EGR valve failure are common, particularly with the D13 engine, leading to moderate repair costs. Transmission problems, particularly with the I-Shift system, can also result in costly repairs. Other common issues like air suspension leaks and sensor failures contribute to the overall maintenance expenses. The severity and cost of repairs can vary, but addressing these issues promptly is essential for maintaining the vehicle's performance and reliability.
