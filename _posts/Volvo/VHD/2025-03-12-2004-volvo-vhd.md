The 2004 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty vocational truck designed for demanding applications such as construction, logging, and refuse hauling. Engine options included the Volvo D12D producing around 435-465 hp and 1550-1650 lb-ft of torque. It was generally praised for its durability, comfortable cab, and strong performance in tough conditions. Some drivers, however, found the ride quality to be stiff and some components expensive to repair. The transmissions include the Volvo ATO2512C and Eaton Fuller manual transmissions, depending on the specifications.
