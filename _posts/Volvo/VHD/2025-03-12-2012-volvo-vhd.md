The 2012 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty vocational truck designed for demanding applications like construction, logging, and refuse hauling. It was offered with a few different engine and transmission options. Common engine choices included the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX12. The Volvo D13, a popular choice, produced between 375 and 500 horsepower and up to 1750 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the VHD's robust build, comfortable cab, and reliability. However, some common complaints include electrical issues, particularly with sensors, and some concerns about the aftertreatment systems.

**Summary**

The 2012 Volvo VHD, while a robust and capable truck, can experience issues common to heavy-duty vehicles, particularly as they age. The most concerning and costly problems often involve the engine (EGR coolers, DPF issues, turbocharger failure) and transmission (shift problems, clutch failure). Electrical issues related to sensor failures and wiring problems are also relatively frequent. Suspension and interior problems, while less severe, can still require attention and expense. Overall, prospective buyers of a used 2012 Volvo VHD should carefully inspect the engine, transmission, and electrical systems, and be prepared for potential repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the specific issue and its severity.
