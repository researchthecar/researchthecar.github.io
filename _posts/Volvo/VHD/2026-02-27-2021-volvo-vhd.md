### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Volvo VHD demonstrates strong reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and structural components, aligning with its heavy-duty vocational purpose. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the complex emissions control systems (DEF system, EGR cooler) and associated sensors, which are common across modern diesel trucks. Transmission issues, primarily with the automated I-Shift, are also noted but generally manageable with timely repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as alternator failures or wiring harness issues, can occur but are not indicative of systemic design flaws. Overall, the VHD is a robust platform, and proactive maintenance, especially concerning emissions components, will contribute significantly to its long-term reliability and operational uptime.
