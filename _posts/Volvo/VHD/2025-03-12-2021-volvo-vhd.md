The 2021 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty truck designed for vocational applications such as construction, refuse, and concrete mixing. Engine options typically include the Volvo D11, D13, and D16. For example, the D13 engine produces around 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque depending on the configuration. Transmission options are typically Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the VHD for its durability, comfortable cab, and Volvo's safety features. Common dislikes include the complexity of the electronics, which can lead to diagnostic challenges, and the higher initial cost compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2021 Volvo VHD is a reliable heavy-duty truck, but like any vehicle, it has potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine (specifically DPF clogging and EGR valve issues), transmission (shift actuator and clutch problems), and electrical system (sensor failures and wiring harness issues). Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission repairs. It is essential to keep up with routine maintenance and address any problems promptly to prevent them from escalating.
