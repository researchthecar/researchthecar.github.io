The 2007 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty vocational truck designed for demanding applications such as construction, logging, and refuse hauling. Engine options for the 2007 VHD included the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX engines. The Volvo D13 engine, for example, produced around 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific configuration. Volvo offered their I-Shift automated manual transmission as well as manual transmissions from Eaton Fuller. Owners often appreciate the VHD's robust build quality, comfortable cab, and Volvo's reputation for safety. Common dislikes may include the higher initial cost compared to some competitors and the potential for costly repairs due to the specialized nature of its components.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

* **Cylinder Head Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking externally from the cylinder head, overheating, white smoke from exhaust. Typically occurs between valve seats.
    * Solution: Cylinder head replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, rough running engine.  Internal leaks within the EGR cooler allow coolant to enter the exhaust stream.
    * Solution: EGR cooler replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, loss of power, black smoke from exhaust.  Caused by wear, contamination, or electrical malfunction.
    * Solution: Fuel injector replacement, fuel system cleaning.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector (depending on location)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Cummins ISX**

* **Injector Cup Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fuel in the coolant, coolant system pressurization, potential for hydrolock. The injector cups seal the injectors in the cylinder head, and if they crack or corrode, fuel can leak into the coolant.
    * Solution: Replacement of the injector cups, coolant flush, and potential injector replacement if contaminated.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black or blue smoke from exhaust, unusual turbocharger noise (whining or screeching).  Bearing failure within the turbocharger is a common cause.
    * Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**
