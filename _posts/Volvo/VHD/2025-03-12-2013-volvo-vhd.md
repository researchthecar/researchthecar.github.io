The 2013 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty vocational truck designed for demanding applications like construction, logging, and refuse hauling. Engine options for the 2013 VHD include the Volvo D11, D13, and D16 engines. The D13 engine, a popular choice, produces between 375 and 500 horsepower and up to 1850 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission, as well as manual transmissions from Eaton. Owners appreciate the VHD's robust build quality, comfortable cab, and Volvo's focus on safety. Common dislikes often revolve around higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors, and occasional issues with the complex electronic systems.

**Summary**

The 2013 Volvo VHD, while a robust and capable vocational truck, can experience issues, particularly with its complex engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Engine issues with the D13 and D16 can lead to significant repair costs, especially related to the EGR cooler, DPF, and injectors. Transmission issues with the I-Shift can also be expensive to address, especially if shift actuators or the clutch fails. Electrical and suspension problems, while typically less expensive than engine or transmission repairs, can still cause downtime and inconvenience. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and consider the potential for higher maintenance costs compared to some other trucks in its class.
