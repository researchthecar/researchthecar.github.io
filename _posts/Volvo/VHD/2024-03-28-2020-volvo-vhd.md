**Introduction**

The 2020 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty truck known for its robust construction, advanced safety features, and fuel efficiency. It is available with a range of engine and transmission options, including the D11, D13, and I-Shift transmission. Drivers generally appreciate its spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and ample power. However, there have been some reported issues with specific components.

**Engine**

**D11 Engine (370 hp, 1450 lb-ft torque)**

* **Turbocharger failure:** Early production models experienced turbocharger failures due to a faulty bearing, resulting in reduced power and potential engine damage. Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $7,000+
* **EGR valve issues:** The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve may experience carbon buildup or malfunction, leading to increased emissions and reduced engine performance. Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**D13 Engine (405 hp, 1650 lb-ft torque)**

* **Injector failure:** Some VHDs equipped with D13 engines manufactured in 2020 reported injector failures, causing engine hesitation, rough idling, and decreased power. Solution: Injector replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $3,500

**Transmission**

**I-Shift Transmission**

* **Shift solenoids:** Shift solenoids, responsible for engaging and disengaging gears, may fail, resulting in erratic shifting, loss of gears, or transmission failure. Solution: Replacement of the shift solenoid pack. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
