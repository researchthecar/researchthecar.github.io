### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Volvo VHD is a robust commercial vehicle known for its durability. However, like many heavy-duty trucks of its era, specific components can be prone to issues over time. The most frequently reported concerns revolve around the engine's EGR system and injector sleeves, particularly with the Volvo D12, and potential camshaft wear or turbocharger issues with the Cummins ISX. Transmission reliability is generally good, but actuators and control modules can require attention. Suspension air springs and height control valves are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from wiring harnesses, and corrosion on the exterior are also points to consider. Regular proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of these issues are key to maximizing the VHD's operational lifespan and minimizing downtime.
