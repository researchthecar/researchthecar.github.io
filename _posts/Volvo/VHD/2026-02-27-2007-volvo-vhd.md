### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volvo VHD demonstrates solid reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and structural components. However, like many heavy-duty trucks, specific issues can arise, primarily related to the emissions system (EGR coolers), fuel delivery (injectors), and automated transmission control modules. Suspension components, especially air springs and their control systems, can also require attention over time. Electrical system issues often stem from wiring harness wear and tear in a demanding operational environment. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of these common problems can significantly extend the lifespan and operational efficiency of the VHD.
