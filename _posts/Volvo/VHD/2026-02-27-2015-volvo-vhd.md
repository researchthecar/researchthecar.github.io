### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volvo VHD demonstrates a generally strong reliability profile, particularly in its core powertrain and chassis components. The D16 engine option stands out with no widespread issues reported. However, the D11 and D13 engines can experience EGR cooler leaks and DPF clogging, respectively, which are common in heavy-duty diesel applications and require attention. Transmission reliability, especially with the I-Shift system, is good, though occasional actuator or software issues can arise. Suspension components, particularly air springs, may develop leaks over time. Electrical systems and interior components like the HVAC blower motor are also areas where minor repairs might be needed. Overall, the VHD is a robust truck, and addressing potential issues proactively will ensure continued dependable service.
