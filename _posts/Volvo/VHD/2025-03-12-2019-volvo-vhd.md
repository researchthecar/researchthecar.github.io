The 2019 Volvo VHD is a vocational heavy-duty truck designed for demanding applications like construction, refuse, and heavy hauling. Engine options include the Volvo D11, D13, and D16. The D13 engine, being a popular choice, produces between 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific tuning. Drivers often praise the VHD for its robust build quality, comfortable cab, and Volvo's focus on safety. However, some common complaints include the complexity of the electrical systems and the higher cost of parts and service compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

*   **EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine derate, check engine light, reduced power, increased emissions, rough idling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging/Failure**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Volvo D11**
No Issues Found

**Volvo D16**
No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift**

*   **Shift Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Rough or jerky shifts, potentially accompanied by a clunking noise.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration/update of the transmission control module (TCM). If the problem persists, inspection and potential replacement of the transmission solenoids, valve body, or clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ for software update, $1000 - $5000+ for component replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPM increases without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, especially under heavy load or acceleration. Burning smell may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, excessive compressor cycling, hissing sound from air lines or air bags.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair or replace leaking air lines, air bags, or leveling valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the component and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, erratic engine behavior, transmission issues, ABS or other system malfunctions. Fault codes indicating specific sensor failures (e.g., wheel speed sensor, temperature sensor).
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific sensor failure and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor (depending on the sensor type and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, short circuits, corrosion, damaged wires due to chafing. Can manifest as various system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Inspection, repair, or replacement of damaged wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent heating or cooling, blower motor malfunction, strange odors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of faulty HVAC components (e.g., blower motor, blend door actuator, compressor).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Volvo VHD, while a robust and capable truck, can experience certain issues. The most prevalent problems appear to revolve around the D13 engine's emissions control system (EGR valve and DPF) and the I-Shift transmission's shifting performance and clutch durability. Electrical issues, particularly sensor failures and wiring harness problems, also contribute to owner complaints. While some repairs, like sensor replacements, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission or DPF replacement, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
