The 2014 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty vocational truck designed for demanding applications like construction, refuse, and logging. Engine options typically include the Volvo D11, D13, and D16 diesel engines. For example, the D13 can produce between 375 and 500 horsepower and up to 1850 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the VHD for its durability, robust construction, and comfortable cab. However, some common complaints revolve around the cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as some specific component issues that can arise in heavy-duty use.

**Summary**

The 2014 Volvo VHD, while a robust and capable truck, can experience several common issues. The engine, particularly the DPF and EGR systems on the D13, and fuel injectors on the D11, and turbos on the D16, are prone to problems. The I-Shift transmission can suffer from SCM and clutch-related failures. Suspension issues, wiring problems, and HVAC malfunctions can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues can range from relatively minor repairs to major overhauls, making preventative maintenance crucial. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to address (lighting), others can be very costly (engine or transmission work).
