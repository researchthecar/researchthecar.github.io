The 2020 Volvo VHD is a heavy-duty vocational truck designed for various applications, including construction, refuse, and distribution. Engine options include the Volvo D11, D13, and D13TC, with horsepower ranging from 325 to 500 and torque from 1250 to 1850 lb-ft, depending on the engine and configuration. These trucks are praised for their robust build, driver comfort, and safety features, but some owners have reported issues related to electrical systems, emissions components, and specific engine components. The automated manual transmission (I-Shift) is standard.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, reduced engine power, and DPF clogging. Can trigger fault codes related to excessive soot accumulation.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration, cleaning, or replacement. Check for underlying issues causing excessive soot production (e.g., faulty injectors, EGR system problems).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Volvo D13TC**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke, unusual noises from the turbocharger, and fault codes.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect oil lines and air filters to identify potential causes of premature failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Volvo D11**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift (Automated Manual)**

*   **Shifting Problems/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, difficulty engaging gears, and jerking during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of the transmission, replacement of faulty solenoids or sensors, or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fault codes related to various sensors (e.g., temperature sensors, pressure sensors, speed sensors). This can lead to inaccurate readings and potentially affect engine performance and fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor. Diagnose underlying causes of sensor failure, such as wiring issues or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, short circuits, and corrosion within wiring harnesses. Can affect various systems, including lighting, sensors, and engine controls.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace damaged wiring harnesses. Ensure proper grounding and protection from moisture and abrasion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, difficulty maintaining ride height, and hissing sounds from air leaks.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace leaking air springs, airlines, or valves. Inspect the air compressor and dryer for proper functioning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ per air spring/component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Lighting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlight, taillight, or turn signal failures. Can be caused by bulb burnout, wiring problems, or faulty connectors.
    *   Solution: Replace bulbs, repair wiring, or replace faulty lighting components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent heating or cooling, blower motor failures, and issues with temperature controls.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace faulty components, such as the blower motor, control module, or actuator. Recharge the refrigerant if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2020 Volvo VHD can experience several issues, primarily related to the D13 engine's EGR cooler and DPF systems, as well as electrical and transmission components. These issues can range from relatively minor sensor failures to more costly repairs involving EGR coolers, turbochargers, DPFs, and transmissions. The air suspension and HVAC systems can also be sources of problems, adding to the overall maintenance cost. While the VHD is known for its durability and comfort, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their maintenance budget.
