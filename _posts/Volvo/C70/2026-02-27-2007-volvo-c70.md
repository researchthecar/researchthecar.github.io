### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volvo C70, while offering a premium convertible experience, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and complexity. The turbocharged engines, particularly the 2.3L and 2.4L variants, can be prone to turbocharger issues and PCV system clogging, requiring attention. The automatic transmission, specifically the AW55-50SN, may develop problems with solenoids and the torque converter. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module or the complex convertible roof mechanism, are also noted. Owners should be aware of potential water leaks from the retractable hardtop seals. Despite these points, the manual transmission and other core components like suspension and the general interior/exterior build quality are generally reliable when properly maintained.
