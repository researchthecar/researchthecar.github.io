The 2008 Volvo C70 is a stylish and versatile hardtop convertible known for its safety features and comfortable ride. It came with a single engine option: a 2.5L turbocharged inline-5 cylinder engine producing 218 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the C70's sleek design and secure feel, but some find the rear seats cramped and the trunk space limited, especially when the top is down.
