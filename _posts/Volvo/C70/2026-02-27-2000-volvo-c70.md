### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Volvo C70 is a generally reliable vehicle, especially considering its age. The most common areas for concern revolve around the turbocharged engines, particularly the turbocharger itself and the PCV system, which require diligent maintenance. Automatic transmissions can experience issues with solenoids and torque converters. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window regulators, are also noted. Convertible models may face challenges with the top's hydraulic system. While these issues can be costly, they are often repairable. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can significantly extend the life and reliability of a 2000 C70.
