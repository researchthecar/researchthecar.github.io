### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Volvo C70, particularly with its turbocharged gasoline engines, can be a rewarding ownership experience. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as turbocharger problems and PCV system blockages, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission, while generally functional, has had reports of solenoid and torque converter failures. The convertible roof mechanism is a complex system and can be a source of expense if hydraulic leaks or pump failures occur. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the CEM module, and window regulator failures are also noted. Despite these points, the C70's robust build and safety features remain strong selling points. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble are key to maintaining reliability.
