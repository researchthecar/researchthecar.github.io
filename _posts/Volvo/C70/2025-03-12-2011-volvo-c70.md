The 2011 Volvo C70 is a stylish and unique retractable hardtop convertible that offered a blend of comfort, safety, and European flair. It came equipped with a 2.5L turbocharged inline-5 engine producing 227 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. All C70s were front-wheel drive and came standard with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the C70 for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and relatively quiet cabin with the top up. Common dislikes include its limited rear seat space, smaller trunk with the top down, and some reliability concerns as it ages.

**Summary**

The 2011 Volvo C70, while a stylish and comfortable convertible, can present several reliability concerns as it ages. Engine oil leaks and transmission issues are among the more common and potentially costly problems.
