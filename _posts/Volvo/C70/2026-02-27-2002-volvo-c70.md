### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Volvo C70 offers a blend of style and safety, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The turbocharged engines, while potent, can be prone to PCV system clogs and turbocharger wear. Automatic transmissions, particularly the AW55-50SN, may develop issues with solenoids or torque converters. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or ABS module, are not uncommon in vehicles of this era. The convertible top mechanism requires regular inspection for leaks and proper function. While the manual transmission is generally more reliable, the overall complexity of the C70 means that some repairs, especially for the convertible top and electrical systems, can be costly. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the reliability of this sporty Volvo.
