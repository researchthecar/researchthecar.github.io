### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Volvo C70, while offering a unique blend of style and safety, presents a mixed reliability picture typical for a vehicle of its age and complexity. Common issues tend to revolve around the turbocharged engines, particularly the turbocharger itself and the PCV system, which require diligent maintenance. Automatic transmission solenoids and torque converters can also be a source of concern. The convertible top mechanism, a defining feature, can be prone to hydraulic leaks or pump failures. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window regulators, are not uncommon. Suspension components like bushings and shocks will likely need attention due to age. While the interior can show wear, especially on leather seats, and headlight lenses may degrade, these are often cosmetic or related to wear and tear. Overall, the C70 can be a rewarding car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
