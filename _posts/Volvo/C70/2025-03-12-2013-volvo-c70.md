The 2013 Volvo C70 is a retractable hardtop convertible offering a unique blend of open-air driving and coupe-like comfort. It came equipped with a single engine option, a 2.5L turbocharged inline-5 producing 227 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the C70 for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and relatively quiet cabin when the top is up. However, some criticisms include limited rear seat space, a somewhat dated infotainment system, and the potential for costly repairs as the car ages.

**Summary**

The 2013 Volvo C70, while stylish and comfortable, has several potential issues that owners should be aware of. Engine oil leaks and PCV system problems are common, as are suspension issues like strut mount failure. The retractable hardtop mechanism can also be a source of expensive repairs.
