The 2006 Volvo C70 is a stylish and versatile convertible offering a blend of comfort and performance. The 2006 model year marked the beginning of the second generation C70, featuring a retractable hardtop.

All engines were paired with either a 5-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praised the C70 for its attractive design, comfortable ride, and safety features.
