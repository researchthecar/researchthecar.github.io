The 2022 Volvo C40 Recharge is an all-electric compact SUV, known for its sleek coupe-like design, quick acceleration, and comfortable interior. It's equipped with a dual-motor setup, delivering all-wheel drive and a combined output of 402 horsepower and 487 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally praise its performance and distinctive styling, but some common complaints revolve around range limitations compared to competitors, the infotainment system's complexity, and limited rear visibility due to the sloping roofline.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Motor (402 hp)**

*   **Reduced Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The real-world range often falls short of the EPA estimated range, especially in colder temperatures or during highway driving. Some owners report significantly lower mileage than expected.
    *   Solution: There is no single "fix," but driving habits, preconditioning the battery, and utilizing energy-saving features can help maximize range. Software updates from Volvo can also sometimes improve battery management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual loss of battery capacity over time and mileage, resulting in reduced range and/or performance. Some early 2022 models reported faster degradation than expected.
    *   Solution: Battery degradation is inherent in all EVs. Volvo offers a battery warranty that covers excessive degradation beyond a certain threshold. Battery replacement is the ultimate fix, but very costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Android Automotive OS-based infotainment system can be slow to respond, glitchy, or prone to freezing. Connectivity problems with mobile devices, navigation errors, and app crashes are also reported.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the primary solution. Resetting the system or performing a factory reset can sometimes resolve minor issues. If the problem persists, dealer diagnosis and potential hardware replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the charging port failing to recognize the charging cable, slow charging speeds, or complete charging failures.
    *   Solution: Try a different charging cable or charging station to isolate the problem. If the issue is with the vehicle's charging port, it may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Software Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A variety of software-related issues, including error messages, malfunctioning safety systems (e.g., Pilot Assist), and unresponsive controls.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the primary solution. A dealer visit may be necessary for more complex issues.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, or other driver assistance features due to sensor failure or miscalibration.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the noise and tighten any loose panels or components. Applying felt tape or other sound-deadening material can help reduce or eliminate the noise. This is often a DIY fix, but a dealer can address it as well.
