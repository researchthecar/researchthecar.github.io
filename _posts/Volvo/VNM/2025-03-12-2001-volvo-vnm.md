The 2001 Volvo VNM series were workhorse semi-trucks designed for regional and vocational applications. Engine options included the Volvo D12, Cummins ISX, and Caterpillar C12. The Volvo D12 produced around 465 horsepower and 1650 lb-ft of torque. Known for their durable construction and comfortable cabs, these trucks were generally well-received for long-haul driving. However, common complaints often revolved around specific engine issues, electrical gremlins, and air suspension problems.
