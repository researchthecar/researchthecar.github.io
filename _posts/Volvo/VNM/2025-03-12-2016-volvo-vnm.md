The 2016 Volvo VNM is a versatile Class 8 semi-truck known for its fuel efficiency, driver comfort, and safety features. Engine options typically included the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX12 (depending on the specific year and configuration). The D13 engine, for example, could produce between 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the VNM for its comfortable cab and smooth ride, while common dislikes include the complexity of the Volvo electrical systems and the higher cost of Volvo-specific parts. Transmission options were often the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission or Eaton Fuller manual transmissions.
