### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volvo VNM demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The most frequently cited technical issues tend to revolve around the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system and turbochargers for the D11 and D13 engines, as well as potential issues with the I-Shift transmission's clutch actuator and control module. Electrical system faults, particularly wiring harness integrity, can also arise. However, many of these issues are not unique to Volvo and are common in heavy-duty trucks. Suspension components, especially air springs and height control valves, may require attention over time. Overall, with diligent preventative maintenance and prompt attention to emerging issues, the 2016 VNM is a capable and reliable truck for commercial operations.
