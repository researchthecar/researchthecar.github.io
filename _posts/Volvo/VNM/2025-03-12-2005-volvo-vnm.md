The 2005 Volvo VNM is a Class 8 commercial truck often used for long-haul trucking. Engine options for this year included the Volvo D12 and Cummins ISX series. The Volvo D12 offered horsepower ranging from 435 to 465 and torque up to 1650 lb-ft. Cummins ISX engines provided a broad range of power outputs, typically from 400 to 565 horsepower. Drivers generally appreciate the VNM for its comfortable cab and reliable engine, but some complain about the complexity of its electrical systems and the cost of Volvo-specific parts.

**Summary**

The 2005 Volvo VNM can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine-related problems, especially those concerning the EGR system and fuel injectors on the D12 and turbo/injector issues on the ISX, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, especially related to the I-Shift's shift actuators, can be expensive as well. Electrical gremlins related to wiring harnesses can also be frustrating to diagnose and fix. While some repairs may be relatively inexpensive, others can easily exceed several thousand dollars. A thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
