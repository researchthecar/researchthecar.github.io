### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Volvo VNM is a capable commercial vehicle with a generally strong reputation for durability. However, specific engine options like the Volvo D12 and Cummins ISX can experience issues such as EGR cooler leaks, fuel injector problems, and turbocharger failures, requiring attention. Transmission reliability is good, but clutch wear in manuals and torque converter issues in automatics are noted. Suspension components, particularly air springs, can develop leaks over time. Electrical systems, especially wiring harnesses, may suffer from corrosion. Frame corrosion is a concern in certain environments. Overall, with diligent maintenance and prompt repair of identified issues, the 2002 VNM can remain a reliable workhorse.
