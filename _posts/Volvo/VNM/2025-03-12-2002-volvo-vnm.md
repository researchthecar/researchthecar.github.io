The 2002 Volvo VNM is a Class 8 heavy-duty truck designed for regional and vocational applications. Engine options typically included Cummins and Volvo engines. The Cummins ISX15 was a common choice, producing around 400-600 horsepower and 1450-2050 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific tuning. Transmission options were generally Eaton Fuller manual transmissions, with 10-speed and 13-speed being the most prevalent. Owners often praised the VNM for its comfortable cab, maneuverability, and reliability, especially in regional hauling. Common complaints included issues with the air conditioning system and certain electrical components, as well as the typical maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty trucks.

**Summary**

The 2002 Volvo VNM, while generally a reliable workhorse, does have its share of common issues. Engine problems, particularly with turbochargers and EGR valves on the Cummins ISX15, and cylinder head cracking on the Volvo D12, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with shift forks and range selectors, can also lead to significant downtime. Electrical problems, due to the age of the vehicle, are common and require careful diagnosis. Overall, owning a 2002 VNM can be a good option if it has been well-maintained, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance and repair costs.
