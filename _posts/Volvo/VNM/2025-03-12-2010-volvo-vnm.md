The 2010 Volvo VNM is a Class 8 heavy-duty truck designed for regional and vocational applications. Engine options for this year included the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX15. Transmissions were typically Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmissions, but manual transmissions from Eaton were also available. The D13 engine, a popular choice, offered horsepower ratings between 405 and 500 hp, and torque ranging from 1450 to 1850 lb-ft, depending on the specific tuning. Owners often appreciate the VNM for its maneuverability, comfortable cab, and fuel efficiency (particularly with the Volvo engines and I-Shift transmission). Common complaints center around the cost of parts and service, as well as some specific issues related to the emissions systems and electrical components.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive coolant consumption, white smoke from the exhaust, engine overheating, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler. Ensure proper cooling system maintenance to prevent future failures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Plugging/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, and eventually, engine shutdown. Often caused by excessive oil consumption or faulty sensors.
    * Solution: DPF cleaning or replacement. Address the underlying cause of the plugging (e.g., oil leaks).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500 (cleaning), $2,000 - $4,000 (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Fuel injector replacement. Diagnose and repair any related issues with fuel pressure or fuel quality.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector (depending on location and accessibility)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Cummins ISX15**

* **EGR Valve Failure**

    * Recalls: None Found

**Eaton Manual Transmissions**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Truck leaning to one side, ride height issues, hissing sound from air leaks.
    * Solution: Identify and repair air leaks (e.g., replace air bags, fittings, or lines).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity and location of the leak)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, warning lights, sensor malfunctions, difficulty starting. Often caused by corrosion or chafing of wires.
    * Solution: Inspect and repair wiring harnesses. Replace damaged wires or connectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, performance issues, incorrect readings from sensors.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty sensors (e.g., ABS sensors, speed sensors, temperature sensors).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor (depending on the sensor type)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight/Taillight Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dim or non-functional headlights or taillights, bulb failures.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Volvo VNM, especially when equipped with a D13 engine and I-Shift transmission, offers a good balance of fuel efficiency and performance. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as EGR cooler/DPF failures on the D13, EGR and Turbocharger issues on the Cummins ISX15, shift actuator issues on the I-Shift transmission, air suspension leaks, and electrical wiring problems. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission repairs. Addressing these issues promptly can prevent more extensive and costly damage down the road.
