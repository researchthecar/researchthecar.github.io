The 2018 Volvo VNM is a versatile Class 8 semi-truck designed for regional and vocational applications. Engine options typically include Volvo's D11, D13, and D13TC (Turbo Compound) engines, offering a range of horsepower and torque. For example, the D13 engine can produce between 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific configuration. Transmission options primarily involve Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Drivers often appreciate the VNM for its maneuverability, comfortable cab, and fuel efficiency. Common dislikes include the proprietary Volvo parts, which can sometimes lead to higher maintenance costs, and some drivers find the I-Shift transmission behavior takes some getting used to.

**Summary**

The 2018 Volvo VNM, while generally reliable, can experience issues ranging from moderate to severe, with repair costs varying widely depending on the component involved. Engine-related problems, particularly concerning the DPF, EGR cooler, and turbocharger, can be costly. Transmission issues with the I-Shift, mainly concerning the clutch actuator and TCM, are also common. Electrical and suspension issues, while less frequent, can still present significant repair expenses. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to maintaining the vehicle's performance and avoiding further damage.
