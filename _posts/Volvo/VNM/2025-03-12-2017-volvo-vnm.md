The 2017 Volvo VNM is a versatile Class 8 semi-truck designed for regional and vocational applications. It's known for its maneuverability, driver comfort, and fuel efficiency. Engine options for the 2017 VNM include the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX12 (depending on specific configuration and model year availability). The Volvo D13 engine produces between 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque, offering a good balance of power and efficiency for regional hauling. While appreciated for its comfortable cab and relatively low operating costs, owners sometimes report issues with the aftertreatment system and electrical components. Common dislikes include the complexity of the emissions systems and the expense of certain repairs.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, DPF warning light illumination, and eventual engine shutdown. Often caused by excessive idling, short trips, or faulty sensors.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration, cleaning of the DPF, or replacement of the DPF. Diagnose and address underlying issues like faulty sensors or excessive oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on cleaning vs. replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and engine warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve. Inspection and cleaning of the EGR cooler may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Cummins ISX12**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, DPF warning light illumination, and eventual engine shutdown. Often caused by excessive idling, short trips, or faulty sensors.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration, cleaning of the DPF, or replacement of the DPF. Diagnose and address underlying issues like faulty sensors or excessive oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on cleaning vs. replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Shift Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, erratic shifting, transmission stuck in gear, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shift actuator. Calibration of the transmission after replacement is critical.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, unusual noises during shifting.
    *   Solution: Clutch adjustment, repair, or replacement. Inspection of the flywheel is recommended during clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, uneven ride height, air compressor running constantly, audible hissing sounds.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair air leaks. This may involve replacing air bags, leveling valves, or air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the leaks and components needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Multiple warning lights illuminated, inaccurate sensor readings (e.g., coolant temperature, oil pressure), performance issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor failure using diagnostic tools and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, short circuits, corrosion, difficulty starting, or complete electrical failure.
    *   Solution: Inspection and repair of the wiring harness. This may involve replacing damaged wires, connectors, or entire sections of the harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Volvo VNM, while generally reliable, experiences common issues, particularly related to the engine's aftertreatment system (DPF, EGR) and electrical components. Transmission problems, especially with the I-Shift, and suspension issues like air leaks can also occur. While sensor and wiring harness failures might not be universal, electrical faults were common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more significant repairs, with costs varying accordingly. DPF and transmission repairs can be costly, while sensor replacements are generally more affordable. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle's service history, focusing on maintenance related to the emission system and transmission.
