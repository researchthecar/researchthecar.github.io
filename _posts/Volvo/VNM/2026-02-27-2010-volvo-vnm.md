### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Volvo VNM demonstrates solid reliability, particularly with its larger D16 engine option. The D11 and D13 engines, while powerful, have documented issues with EGR coolers and fuel injectors, respectively, which are common in many modern diesel engines. Transmission reliability is generally good, with the I-Shift requiring occasional software attention or actuator service. Suspension components, especially air bags, can require attention over time. Electrical system issues, such as wiring harness problems, are not uncommon in heavy-duty vehicles and can be costly to repair. Overall, the VNM is a capable truck, but proactive maintenance and awareness of potential issues, especially concerning the EGR system and fuel delivery on specific engines, are key to maximizing its operational lifespan and minimizing downtime.
