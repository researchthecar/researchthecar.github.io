The 2011 Volvo VNM is a versatile class 8 semi-truck designed for regional and vocational applications. Engine options for this year include the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX12. The Volvo D13, a popular choice, produces around 400-500 horsepower and 1450-1750 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Transmission options primarily include Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission and Eaton Fuller manual transmissions. Owners often appreciate the VNM for its comfortable cab, maneuverability in urban environments, and fuel efficiency. Common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs and the complexity of some of the electronic systems.
