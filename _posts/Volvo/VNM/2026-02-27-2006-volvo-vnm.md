### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Volvo VNM demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and chassis components when properly maintained. The most frequently reported technical issues tend to be related to the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system and DPF clogging on specific engine variants, as well as potential issues with automated transmission control modules. Electrical gremlins and air suspension leaks can also occur, especially on higher mileage units. However, these are often repairable with dedicated service. The VNM's reputation for durability remains strong, with most problems being addressable and not indicative of systemic design flaws, making it a dependable choice for vocational use.
