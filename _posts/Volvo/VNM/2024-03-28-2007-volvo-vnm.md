**Introduction**

The 2007 Volvo VNM is a heavy-duty commercial truck offered with several engine and transmission options. The D13 engine produces 425 horsepower and 1,550 pound-feet of torque, while the D16 engine produces 475 horsepower and 1,750 pound-feet of torque. Both engines are mated to a standard 10-speed transmission or an optional 12-speed transmission. Owners appreciate the VNM's reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable interior, but some have encountered issues with the vehicle.

**Engine**

**D13 Engine**

* **Injector Failure:** Injectors can fail, causing rough idling, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. Replace all injectors. $1,500+

**D16 Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** Turbos can fail prematurely, resulting in reduced power and increased exhaust smoke. Replace the turbocharger. $2,000+
* **EGR Valve Issues:** EGR valves can become clogged or malfunction, leading to reduced engine performance and increased emissions. Clean or replace the EGR valve. $500+

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Transmission**

* **Shifting Problems:** Some transmissions may experience difficulty shifting gears or may slip out of gear. Replace faulty transmission components. $1,000+

**12-Speed Transmission**

* **Synchronization Issues:** Synchronizers can wear prematurely, causing grinding noises and difficulty shifting. Replace the synchronizers. $1,200+
* **ECM Failure:** The electronic control module (ECM) can fail, resulting in erratic shifting and loss of power. Replace the ECM. $2,000+

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Breakage:** Leaf springs can break, causing the vehicle to sag and affect handling. Replace the leaf springs. $500+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Electrical components can draw power when the vehicle is off, draining the battery. Diagnose and repair the electrical system. $50 - $200+
* **Alternator Failure:** Alternators can fail, preventing the battery from charging. Replace the alternator. $500+

**Exterior**

* **Corrosion on Exhaust System:** Exhaust components can corrode and rust, leading to leaks and reduced performance. Replace the affected components. $500+

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Lights Malfunction:** Dashboard lights may fail to illuminate or may flicker. Diagnose and repair the electrical issue causing the malfunction. $100 - $200+
* **Climate Control Issues:** Climate control systems may malfunction, affecting heating and cooling performance. Replace faulty components within the system. $500+

**Summary**

The 2007 Volvo VNM is generally a reliable and efficient truck, but owners have experienced some issues that can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the 12-speed transmission, seem to be the most common and expensive issue. Electrical and interior issues are relatively minor and less expensive to fix. Overall, the VNM's issues are not widespread or severe enough to detract significantly from its overall reliability and value.
