The 2017 Volvo B290R is a bus chassis commonly used for coaches and city buses. Specific engine and transmission configurations can vary depending on the bodybuilder and intended application, but a common engine option is the Volvo D8 engine, a 7.7-liter inline-six diesel. This engine can produce around 330-350 horsepower and roughly 900-1000 lb-ft of torque, again dependent on exact specification. Volvo buses are generally liked for their reliability, safety features, and comfortable ride. Common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs and the complexity of modern bus systems.

**Engine**

**Volvo D8**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, increased fuel consumption, and potential black smoke from the exhaust. Diagnostic trouble codes related to fuel injector performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors. It is often recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, poor fuel economy, black smoke, and potential engine stalling. Diagnostic trouble codes related to EGR system performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve. Cleaning the EGR cooler may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF Ecolife 6AP2000B**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or slipping during acceleration, difficulty shifting, and abnormal noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Inspecting the transmission for further damage is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, failure to shift, limp mode, and diagnostic trouble codes related to the transmission control unit.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reprogramming of the mechatronic unit. Check wiring harness and connections for damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaning to one side, uneven ride height, rough ride, and hissing sound from the air spring.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air spring. Inspecting the air lines and compressor for leaks is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per air spring
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ride Height Sensor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Incorrect ride height, unstable ride, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ride height sensor. Calibrating the suspension system may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Multiplexing System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failures of various electrical components, such as lights, wipers, and HVAC system. Error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the wiring harness, replacing faulty control modules, and reprogramming the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, and eventual battery drain.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator. Inspecting the battery and charging system for further issues is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors failing to open or close properly, requiring manual operation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$1,000+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent heating or cooling, blower motor failure, and unusual noises from the HVAC unit.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the HVAC system, replacing faulty components such as the blower motor, compressor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Volvo B290R is a robust bus chassis, but like any vehicle, it is susceptible to certain issues. The most commonly reported problems revolve around the engine (fuel injectors, EGR valve), transmission (torque converter, mechatronics unit), suspension (air springs, ride height sensors), and electrical systems (multiplexing system, alternator). The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for maintaining the reliability and safety of the bus. Overall, the cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the nature and extent of the problem.
