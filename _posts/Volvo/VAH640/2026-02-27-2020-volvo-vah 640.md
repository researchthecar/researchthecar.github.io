### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Volvo VAH 640 demonstrates a generally strong reliability profile, typical of Volvo's heavy-duty offerings. The most frequently cited technical concerns revolve around the emissions control system, specifically the Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) system, which can present issues across both the D11 and D13 engines. EGR cooler leaks are also a noted concern for the D13. For transmissions, the automated I-Shift can experience issues with its clutch actuator and control module, while manual Eaton Fuller transmissions are robust. Suspension components, particularly air springs and height control valves, can develop leaks over time. Electrical system issues, primarily related to wiring harness integrity, are also a possibility in heavy-duty vocational use. Overall, proactive maintenance and prompt attention to emissions-related warnings are key to maximizing the reliability of the VAH 640.
