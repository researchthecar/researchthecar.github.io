### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Volvo S60 demonstrates a strong overall reliability record, especially considering its advanced technology and premium positioning. The powertrain, particularly the automatic transmission, is generally robust. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the engine's cooling system and turbocharger on the T5 and T6 variants, and specific hybrid system components on the T8. The adaptive suspension can also be a source of repair costs if dampers fail. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Despite these points, the S60 remains a solid choice for those prioritizing safety and comfort, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of systemic failure across the model range.
