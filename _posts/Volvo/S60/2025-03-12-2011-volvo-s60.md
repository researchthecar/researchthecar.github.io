The 2011 Volvo S60 marked a significant redesign, offering a sportier and more luxurious experience than its predecessor. Engine options included a 2.5L turbocharged inline-5 (T5) producing 250 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 (T6) making 300 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the S60 for its comfortable seats, distinctive styling, and emphasis on safety. Common dislikes included a somewhat cramped rear seat, infotainment system complexity, and potentially higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors.
