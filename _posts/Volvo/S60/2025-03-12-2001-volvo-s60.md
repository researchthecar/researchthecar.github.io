The 2001 Volvo S60 marked a shift for Volvo, blending safety with a more sporting character. The S60 came with several engine options, including a 2.4L inline-5 producing around 168 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque, a turbocharged 2.4L inline-5 delivering 197 hp, and the higher-performance T5 variant with a turbocharged 2.3L inline-5 generating 247 hp. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the S60 for its comfortable ride, safety features, and distinctive styling. Common dislikes include electrical gremlins, some maintenance costs, and the age-related issues that plague older vehicles.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-5 (Non-Turbo)**

*   **Electronic Throttle Module (ETM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power warning, limp mode, erratic idling, and potential stalling. These symptoms are often intermittent. The ETM is known to have issues with its internal sensors degrading over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ETM with an updated version or having the existing ETM refurbished by a specialist. Software updates can sometimes help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ depending on whether a new or refurbished ETM is used and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor fuel economy, rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the brand and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L/2.3L Inline-5 (Turbo)**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the turbo, reduced power, and potential oil leaks. The turbocharger can fail due to oil starvation or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on whether a new or rebuilt turbo is used and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Boost Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, poor fuel economy, and hissing sounds during acceleration. Common culprits are cracked or loose vacuum hoses and intercooler piping.
    *   Solution: Replacing the damaged hoses and clamps.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Electronic Throttle Module (ETM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power warning, limp mode, erratic idling, and potential stalling. These symptoms are often intermittent. The ETM is known to have issues with its internal sensors degrading over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ETM with an updated version or having the existing ETM refurbished by a specialist. Software updates can sometimes help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ depending on whether a new or refurbished ETM is used and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AW50/51 (5-speed Automatic)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, and potential failure to shift at all. The valve body contains solenoids and valves that control the flow of transmission fluid, and these can wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. A complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether a new, rebuilt, or used transmission is installed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, and poor acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. The bushings degrade over time due to age and exposure to the elements.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on whether just the bushings or the entire arm is replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noisy suspension (clunking or creaking), poor handling, and vibrations.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Electronic Module (CEM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as malfunctioning lights, wipers, or power windows. The CEM controls various electrical functions in the car and can be susceptible to moisture damage.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the CEM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminated on the dashboard, loss of ABS functionality, and potential issues with the speedometer.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the ABS module.

**Summary**

The 2001 Volvo S60, while appreciated for its comfort and safety, is prone to age-related issues, especially within the engine's ETM and turbo systems (if equipped), transmission valve bodies, suspension bushings, and electrical components. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the chosen solution, but owners should budget for potential expenses related to these common faults. The most expensive repairs are typically related to the transmission and turbocharger.
