**Summary**

While the 2004 Volvo S60 is generally a reliable and well-built vehicle, it has been reported to have some common issues. The most severe and expensive issue is the turbocharger failure on the 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-5 engine (218 HP). Other issues, such as the intake manifold failure on the 2.4-liter naturally aspirated inline-5 engine and the TCM failure on the 6-speed automatic transmission, can also be costly to repair. However, many of the other issues, such as the suspension issues and the interior issues, are relatively minor and less expensive to fix.
