### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volvo S60 offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly with its manual transmission variants. The turbocharged engines, while potent, are more prone to specific issues like PCV system clogs and turbocharger wear, requiring diligent maintenance. Automatic transmissions can develop solenoid or torque converter problems. Suspension components, especially bushings and strut mounts, are common wear items on vehicles of this age. Electrical gremlins, often centered around the CEM module, can be a significant concern, leading to various intermittent faults. Interior issues are typically minor, such as climate control actuators or sunroof drain blockages. Proactive maintenance and addressing early symptoms are key to mitigating these potential reliability concerns.
