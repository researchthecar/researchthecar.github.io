**Introduction:**

The 2001 Volvo S60 is a compact luxury sedan that debuted with a 2.4-liter, 170-horsepower 5-cylinder engine mated to a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. Other engine and transmission options include a 2.4-liter, 197-horsepower turbocharged 5-cylinder engine paired with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission, and a 2.3-liter, 268-horsepower turbocharged 5-cylinder engine paired with a 6-speed manual transmission.

Drivers praise the S60 for its comfortable and spacious interior, sharp handling, and excellent safety features. However, it has received some criticism for its limited rear seat space and somewhat underwhelming performance from the base engine.

**Engine**

**2.4-liter, 170-horsepower 5-cylinder engine**

- **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt can break prematurely, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include rough idling, engine misfires, and difficulty starting. Solution: Replace the timing belt and associated components, typically around $1,000 - $1,500.
- **Oil leaks from valve cover gasket:** The valve cover gasket can fail, causing oil to leak onto the engine. Symptoms include visible oil leaks and a burning oil smell. Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket, typically around $200 - $400.

**2.4-liter, 197-horsepower turbocharged 5-cylinder engine**

- **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail, resulting in reduced engine power and a loss of boost. Symptoms include black smoke from the exhaust, a whistling noise during acceleration, and sluggish performance. Solution: Replace the turbocharger, typically around $1,500 - $2,500.

**Transmission**

**5-speed manual transmission**

- **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out over time, leading to difficulty engaging or disengaging gears. Symptoms include slipping gears, a burning smell, and difficulty changing gears. Solution: Replace the clutch, typically around $500 - $1,000.

**5-speed automatic transmission**

- **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing the transmission to slip or shudder. Symptoms include a slipping transmission, rough shifts, and a whining noise. Solution: Replace the torque converter, typically around $1,000 - $2,000.

**Suspension**

- **Strut mount failure:** The strut mounts can fail, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps. Symptoms include a knocking or rattling noise, reduced handling, and uneven tire wear. Solution: Replace the strut mounts, typically around $200 - $400 each.

- **Control arm bushing failure:** The control arm bushings can wear out over time, leading to a loss of alignment and poor handling. Symptoms include vibrations, a pulling sensation when steering, and uneven tire wear. Solution: Replace the control arm bushings, typically $150 - $300 per bushing.

**Electrical**

- **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, resulting in a loss of electrical power. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car, dim headlights, and a battery warning light. Solution: Replace the alternator, typically around $500 - $1,000.

- **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, preventing the engine from starting. Symptoms include no sound when turning the key, a clicking noise, or intermittent starting problems. Solution: Replace the starter, typically around $300 - $600.

**Exterior**

- **Weak headlight performance:** The headlights may provide insufficient illumination at night. Symptoms include poor visibility, especially in low-light conditions. Solution: Upgrade the headlights, typically $500 - $1,000+.

**Interior**

- **Dashboard rattle:** The dashboard may rattle or creak when driving over rough roads. Symptoms include a buzzing or squeaking noise coming from the dashboard. Solution: Apply sound-deadening material to the dashboard, typically $100 - $200.

- **Power window failure:** The power windows may fail to operate or become intermittent. Symptoms include windows that do not roll up or down or windows that operate sporadically. Solution: Repair or replace the power window motor, switch, or wiring, typically $200 - $500 per window.

**Summary**

Overall, the 2001 Volvo S60 has a few common issues that can be costly to repair, particularly the timing belt failure and turbocharger failure. However, the car's strengths in safety, comfort, and handling make it a popular choice among drivers who value those qualities. The severity of the issues and the cost to fix them vary depending on the specific problem and the extent of the repairs needed.
