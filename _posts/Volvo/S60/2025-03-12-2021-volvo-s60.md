The 2021 Volvo S60 is a stylish and comfortable compact luxury sedan. Engine options include the T5, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque; the T6, a 2.0-liter turbocharged *and* supercharged four-cylinder making 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque; and the T8 Recharge, a plug-in hybrid combining the supercharged/turbocharged engine with an electric motor, resulting in 400 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque (or 415hp in later 2021 models). All engines are paired with an Aisin-Warner 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the S60's elegant design, comfortable interior, and advanced safety features. Common dislikes include the somewhat complex infotainment system and occasionally reported reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged (T5)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled services. This is often noticed by observing the low engine oil warning light illuminating or by physically checking the dipstick and seeing low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Addressing the issue might involve performing an oil consumption test to determine the extent of the problem. The fix could range from replacing PCV valve components to, in more severe cases, replacing piston rings or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: The cost can range from a few hundred dollars for PCV valve repairs to several thousand dollars for more extensive engine work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged (T6 & T8 Recharge)**

*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced performance, a whining noise from the engine bay (especially during acceleration), and potential error codes related to the supercharger. The supercharger clutch is responsible for engaging the supercharger, and failure can cause the engine to rely solely on the turbocharger, resulting in sluggishness.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the supercharger clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking from around the water pump. May be able to smell coolant as well.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin-Warner 8-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifts, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or "jerk" during acceleration or deceleration. Some vehicles may also exhibit hesitation when shifting from Park or Reverse into Drive.
    *   Solution: The common first step is a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). If the problem persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may be recommended. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal transmission damage might necessitate transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 for a software update, $300 - $500 for a fluid flush, $2,500 - $6,000+ for repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues (Sensus)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system can experience glitches such as freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation malfunctions.
    *   Solution: The initial step is often a software update. If problems persist, a system reset or, in rare cases, replacement of the infotainment unit might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$200 for a software update, $500 - $1500+ for unit replacement (if necessary).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with various sensors, including parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring sensors, and adaptive cruise control sensors, can lead to warning lights, error messages, and malfunctioning safety systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on the type and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions, including failure to open or close properly, unusual noises during operation, and water leaks.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and cleaning the sunroof tracks and drains. Replacing faulty sunroof motor or components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for cleaning and lubrication; $300 - $1000+ for component replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Braking System Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sudden and unexpected braking, often with no obstacles present in front of the vehicle.
    * Solution: Software update. If that does not work, then it could be a malfunctioning sensor that needs replacing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 for a software update. $200-$800+ per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Volvo S60, while generally well-received for its design and features, has some common issues. Engine problems, such as oil consumption and supercharger issues, are significant. Transmission problems mostly revolve around shifting smoothness. Electrical and interior problems are less severe but can be annoying. The potential costs to address these problems can vary widely, from a few hundred dollars for software updates and sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission repairs. Potential buyers should have a mechanic do a pre-purchase inspection of the vehicle, and be aware of these possible issues before buying a used 2021 Volvo S60.
