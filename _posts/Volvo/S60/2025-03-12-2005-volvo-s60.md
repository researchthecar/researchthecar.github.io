The 2005 Volvo S60 is a popular sedan known for its safety, comfort, and distinctive Scandinavian design. Engine options include a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-5 producing 168 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L turbocharged inline-5 producing 208 hp and 236 lb-ft of torque, and a high-performance 2.5L turbocharged inline-5 in the S60R producing 300 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was generally paired with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.5L and S60R models came with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. People appreciate the S60's comfortable ride, supportive seats, and robust build quality. Common dislikes include higher repair costs compared to domestic vehicles and some quirky electronic features.

**Summary**
The 2005 Volvo S60, while generally a reliable and comfortable vehicle, can suffer from several common issues. Engine problems, such as ignition coil and PCV system failures, can be relatively inexpensive to fix. However, turbocharger failures, especially on 2.5L models, can be costly. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic transmission's valve body, are also a common concern. Electrical problems, such as ETM and CEM failures, can be complex and expensive to diagnose and repair. While the S60 is praised for its safety and driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs.
