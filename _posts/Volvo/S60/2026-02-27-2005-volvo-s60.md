### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Volvo S60 is a solid vehicle with a reputation for safety and durability. Common issues tend to be related to age and mileage, particularly concerning oil leaks from seals and gaskets, and potential PCV system clogs on the gasoline engines. Automatic transmission solenoids and torque converters can also be a point of concern. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and ABS module, are not uncommon. Suspension components like bushings and shocks will likely require attention on higher mileage examples. While not immune to problems, most issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, making the S60 a potentially reliable choice if well-maintained.
