### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Volvo S60 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly known for its safety and comfort. However, common issues tend to center around the PCV system in gasoline engines, potential turbocharger problems on turbocharged models, and some specific electrical gremlins related to the BCM and CEM modules. Automatic transmission solenoids and torque converters can also be a point of concern. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts may require attention over time. While not overwhelmingly problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into their ownership considerations.
