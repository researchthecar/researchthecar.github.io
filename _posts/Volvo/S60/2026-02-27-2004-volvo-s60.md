### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volvo S60 is a well-built car, but like many vehicles from this era, it can develop specific issues. Common concerns revolve around the engine's PCV system and potential oil leaks, especially on the naturally aspirated engines. Turbocharged models may face turbocharger wear. Automatic transmissions, particularly the AW55-50SN, are known for potential harsh shifting or solenoid issues, requiring diligent maintenance. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, ABS module, or CEM module (especially due to water ingress), are also reported. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts can wear over time. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the S60 can remain a reliable and enjoyable vehicle.
