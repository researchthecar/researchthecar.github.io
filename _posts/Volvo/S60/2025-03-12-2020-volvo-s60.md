The 2020 Volvo S60 is a stylish and comfortable compact luxury sedan, known for its safety features and Scandinavian design. Engine options include the T5 (turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque), the T6 (turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque), and the T8 eAWD Plug-In Hybrid (turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter inline-4 paired with an electric motor, producing 400 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with an Aisin-Warner 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the S60's comfortable ride, elegant interior, and advanced safety technology. Common complaints include the somewhat complex infotainment system and the limited rear-seat legroom compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2020 Volvo S60 is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues related to oil consumption, the infotainment system, and hybrid system components (for T8 models). While some issues are minor and easily resolved with software updates or fluid changes, others can be more serious and costly, such as engine or transmission repairs. The hybrid battery issues, while not widespread, can be a significant expense. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used S60, especially hybrid models, before purchasing.
