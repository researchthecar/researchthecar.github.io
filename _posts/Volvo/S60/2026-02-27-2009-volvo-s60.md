### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volvo S60 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly known for its safety and comfort. However, owners should be aware of potential issues related to the PCV system and turbochargers on its turbocharged engines, as well as common transmission problems like solenoid or valve body failures, especially on higher mileage examples. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Body Control Module and ABS module, can also arise. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts may require attention due to age and mileage. While interior and exterior components are typically robust, climate control panel issues and seat heater failures have been noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these specific issues can help maintain the S60's reliability.
