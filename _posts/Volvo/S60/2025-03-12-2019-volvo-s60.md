The 2019 Volvo S60 is a luxury sedan offering a blend of Scandinavian design, comfort, and technology. It's available with several powertrain options. The T5 engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The T6 adds a supercharger to the turbocharger, boosting output to 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The T8 eAWD is a plug-in hybrid variant of the T6, adding an electric motor for a combined output of 400 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an Aisin 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the S60 for its stylish interior, comfortable seats, and advanced safety features. However, some criticisms include the complex infotainment system and the limited rear seat space.

**Summary**

The 2019 Volvo S60 presents a mixed bag of potential issues. The severity ranges from minor electrical glitches and interior annoyances to more serious engine and transmission problems. Coolant leaks, sensor malfunctions, and infotainment system issues are somewhat common, but the excessive oil consumption with the T5 and battery problems on the T8 are potentially more costly to address. While not every S60 will experience these problems, it's essential to be aware of them during pre-purchase inspections and regular maintenance. Overall, the severity is moderate, and the cost to repair the listed issues may vary depending on the extent of the damage and which part has failed.
