### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Volvo S60 generally offers good reliability, particularly in its suspension, exterior, and interior components, which show no widespread reported issues. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the turbocharged engines, specifically the turbocharger itself and potential coolant leaks on the 2.0L, and PCV system and timing chain issues on the 3.0L. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, are also noted, often addressable with maintenance or module replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also reported. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate many of these potential problems.
