### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Volvo S60 offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly in its core mechanical components. The most frequently reported issues tend to revolve around the turbocharged engines, specifically turbocharger longevity and PCV system health, along with potential transmission shudder in the automatic gearbox. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are also noted but not excessively common. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Exterior and interior elements are typically robust, with no widespread critical failures reported. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning fluid changes and monitoring for early signs of turbo issues, is recommended for optimal long-term reliability.
