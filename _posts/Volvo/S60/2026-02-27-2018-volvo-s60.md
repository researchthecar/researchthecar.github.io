### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Volvo S60 demonstrates good overall reliability, with the powertrain, particularly the turbocharged and supercharged engines, being the most common source of reported technical issues. Common problems include coolant leaks and turbocharger concerns for the T5, and PCV system clogs and timing chain wear for the T6. The 8-speed automatic transmission is generally robust but can experience software glitches. Electrical systems, especially battery drain and infotainment issues, are also noted. Suspension, exterior, and interior components show strong reliability. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of engine or electrical issues can help maintain the S60's dependability.
