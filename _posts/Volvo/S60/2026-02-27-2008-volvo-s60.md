### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Volvo S60 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its naturally aspirated engines and manual transmissions. The turbocharged 2.5L and 2.0L engines are generally robust but can be prone to PCV system issues and, in some cases, turbocharger problems, especially if not maintained diligently. Automatic transmissions, specifically the AW55-50SN, may require attention for solenoid or torque converter issues as mileage increases. Suspension components like control arm bushings and rear springs can wear over time. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or ABS module, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age. While not immune to age-related wear, the S60 remains a solid choice with proactive maintenance addressing these potential concerns.
