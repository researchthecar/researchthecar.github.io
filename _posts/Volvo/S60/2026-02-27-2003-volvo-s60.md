### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Volvo S60 offers a blend of safety and comfort, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The engine's PCV system and turbochargers (on turbocharged models) are notable weak points. Automatic transmission solenoids and torque converters can also require attention. Electrically, water intrusion into the CEM module is a significant concern, leading to a cascade of problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and sway bar links are also subject to wear. While the exterior and manual transmission are generally reliable, addressing these specific areas proactively can help maintain the S60's overall dependability and value.
