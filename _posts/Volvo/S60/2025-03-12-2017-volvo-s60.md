The 2017 Volvo S60 is a compact luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and focus on safety. Engine options for this year included several variations of a 2.0L turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder engine, often referred to as the "T6" or "Drive-E" engine, producing around 302 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque in its most powerful configuration. Other engine options include the T5 2.0L turbo four cylinder which outputs 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an Aisin-Warner 8-speed automatic transmission. Common likes include the comfortable and supportive seats, upscale interior, and responsive handling. Dislikes often center around the somewhat complicated infotainment system and limited rear seat space compared to some competitors.
