## Engine

### 2.0L Turbocharged (B4/B5)
**Coolant Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible coolant puddles under the vehicle, low coolant level warning light, engine overheating.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of leaking hoses, seals, or the water pump.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Turbocharger Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of power, whistling noises from the engine bay, increased oil consumption, check engine light.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential replacement of the turbocharger or related components like wastegate actuator.
- **Cost:** $1,200 - $2,500


### 2.0L Plug-in Hybrid (T8/Recharge)
**Hybrid Battery Pack Degradation**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced electric-only range, decreased overall performance, hybrid system warning lights.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis by a Volvo specialist; potential battery module replacement or full pack replacement.
- **Cost:** $5,000 - $15,000+

**High-Voltage System Faults**
- **Symptoms:** Warning messages related to the hybrid system, loss of power, inability to charge.
- **Solution:** Requires specialized diagnostic tools and expertise to identify and repair faulty components within the high-voltage system.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $5,000+


## Transmission

### 8-Speed Geartronic Automatic
**Harsh Shifting / Jerking**
- **Symptoms:** Noticeable jolts or hesitations during gear changes, particularly at lower speeds.
- **Solution:** Software updates for the transmission control module, or in more severe cases, internal transmission repairs or replacement.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,000

**Transmission Fluid Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Leaking fluid from the transmission pan or seals, potential for slipping gears or warning lights.
- **Solution:** Replacement of seals, gaskets, or the transmission pan.

### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Volvo S60 demonstrates solid reliability, particularly in its chassis, suspension, and exterior components, where no significant widespread issues are reported. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the powertrain, especially with the more complex plug-in hybrid system experiencing potential battery degradation or high-voltage faults, and the turbocharged engines occasionally showing coolant leaks or turbocharger issues. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting, often rectifiable with software updates. Electrical gremlins, mainly concerning the infotainment system's responsiveness and premature 12V battery failure, are also noted. Overall, the S60 is a reliable vehicle, but owners of hybrid models should be aware of the potential for higher repair costs associated with the advanced hybrid technology.
