The 2018 Volvo VNL 300 is a popular semi-truck known for its comfort, fuel efficiency, and safety features. Engine options for this model year include the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins X15. The D13 engine, a popular choice, delivers around 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Transmission options typically include Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission, as well as manual transmissions. Drivers often appreciate the VNL 300's spacious cab and smooth ride, but some have reported issues with certain electronic components and aftertreatment systems.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**
*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, decreased engine performance. Internal EGR cooler leaking coolant into the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler. It's often recommended to inspect and clean the EGR valve and related components at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, DPF light illumination, potential for engine derate. Can be caused by ash accumulation, soot buildup, or sensor malfunction.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration, DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement. Check related sensors and exhaust system components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+ depending on the solution required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Cummins X15**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injector(s). Perform injector cutout test to confirm the cylinder with the failing injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per injector, depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke from exhaust, unusual turbocharger noise.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect the oil supply line for restrictions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Volvo D11**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift**
*   **Shift Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, transmission getting stuck in gear, error codes related to the shift actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the shift actuator. Recalibration of the transmission system might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, clutch noise.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Manual Transmission**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**
*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, uneven ride height, air compressor running constantly, hissing sound from air leaks.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair air leaks in the air lines, air bags, or leveling valves. Replace damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**
*   **Sensor Failures (various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A wide range of issues depending on the sensor affected. Examples include faulty ABS sensor leading to ABS warning light, faulty coolant temperature sensor leading to incorrect temperature readings, etc.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor failure and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the sensor and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
*   **Headlight Condensation**

**Summary**

The 2018 Volvo VNL 300 has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant problems appear to be related to engine components like the EGR cooler (D13) and fuel injectors (Cummins X15), as well as transmission issues in the I-Shift models. Electrical sensor failures and air suspension leaks also surface with some frequency. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. While not all VNL 300s will experience these problems, it's crucial to have a thorough pre-purchase inspection conducted by a qualified mechanic to identify potential issues early on.
