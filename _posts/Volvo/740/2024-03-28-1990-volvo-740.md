**Introduction:**

The 1990 Volvo 740 is a mid-size sedan known for its safety, durability, and practicality. It was offered with various engine and transmission options, providing drivers with a range of performance choices. Despite its reputation, the 740 has been associated with several specific issues over the years.

**Engine**

**2.3 Liter Inline-4**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** This issue occurs when the gasket between the intake manifold and engine head fails, resulting in vacuum leaks and performance issues. Symptoms include loss of power, rough idling, and increased emissions. Replacing the gasket typically costs $100 - $200+.
* **Oil Pan Leak:** The oil pan gasket can develop leaks, causing oil loss. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle and low oil levels on the dipstick. The repair involves replacing the gasket and resealing the oil pan, costing around $200 - $300+.

**2.3 Liter Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail due to bearing wear or oil starvation. Symptoms include reduced power, increased exhaust smoke, and unusual noises. Replacing the turbocharger is a major repair costing $1,500 - $2,500+.
* **Head Gasket Failure:** This issue is similar to the intake manifold gasket failure on the non-turbo engine. It results in coolant and oil leaks, along with performance issues and overheating. Replacing the head gasket is a labor-intensive repair costing $1,000 - $1,500+.

**Transmission**

**M46 Manual Transmission**

* **Clutch Failure:** The clutch can wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting gears, slipping, or shuddering. Replacing the clutch kit typically costs $500 - $700+.
* **Transmission Mount Failure:** The transmission mounts can deteriorate, causing excessive vibration and difficulty shifting gears. Replacing the mounts costs around $200 - $300+.

**AW70 Automatic Transmission**

* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** The shift solenoids can malfunction, leading to transmission problems such as delayed or harsh shifting and disengagement from gears. Replacing the solenoids typically costs $300 - $500+.
* **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter can develop issues, causing shuddering, slipping, or overheating. Replacement is a major repair costing $1,000 - $1,500+.

**Suspension**

* **Suspension Strut Wear:** The suspension struts can wear out, leading to reduced handling, a rougher ride, and premature tire wear. Replacing a set of struts typically costs $500 - $800+.
* **Sway Bar Link Failure:** The sway bar links can break, resulting in increased body roll and excessive noise. Replacing the links costs around $200 - $300+ per pair.

**Electrical**

* **Headlight Wiring Harness Failure:** The headlight wiring harness can develop problems, causing intermittent or complete headlight failure. Replacing the harness typically costs $300 - $500+.
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, resulting in loss of electrical power and difficulty starting the vehicle. Replacing the alternator costs around $500 - $700+.

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Corrosion:** The tailgate on the 740 can develop rust and corrosion, especially around the hinges and lower edges. This can lead to structural damage and water leaks. Repair or replacement costs vary depending on the extent of damage.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard can develop cracks over time, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight. This is a cosmetic issue with no known solution beyond replacement.
* **Radio Display Failure:** The radio display can fail, resulting in incorrect or no information being displayed. Replacing the display typically costs $200 - $300+.

**Summary:**

The 1990 Volvo 740 is a practical and durable vehicle but has faced several specific issues over the years. Some of these issues, such as gasket failures and transmission problems, can be moderately expensive to repair. However, the vehicle's overall reliability and safety still make it a popular choice for those seeking a classic Swedish sedan.
