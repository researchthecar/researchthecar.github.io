## Summary

The 1992 Volvo 940 is a reliable and comfortable vehicle, but it has some common issues that owners should be aware of. The most serious issue is the timing belt failure on the 2.4-liter inline-6 engine, which can lead to catastrophic engine damage if not repaired promptly. Other issues include head gasket failure, intake manifold gasket failure, oil leaks, and transmission problems. However, many of these issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, and the overall cost of ownership for the 940 is reasonable.
