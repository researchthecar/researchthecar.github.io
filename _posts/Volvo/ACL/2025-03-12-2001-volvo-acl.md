The 2001 Volvo S60, known as the ACL internally, marked Volvo's entry into the competitive mid-size sedan market. It was praised for its safety, comfort, and distinctive Scandinavian design. However, like all vehicles, it has its share of common issues. Engine options for the 2001 S60 included a 2.4L inline-5 producing around 168 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque and a turbocharged 2.3L inline-5 producing 247 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciated the S60's comfortable ride and secure handling. Some disliked the somewhat quirky electronics and occasional reliability quirks.
