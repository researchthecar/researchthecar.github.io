**Summary**

The 2002 Volvo C70, while stylish and comfortable, can suffer from several common issues. Engine problems, particularly with oil leaks and turbocharger issues on the 2.3L turbo and ETM issues on the 2.4L turbo, can be costly to address. Transmission problems, specifically slipping and harsh shifting with the Aisin Warner automatic, are also significant concerns. Suspension wear, electrical glitches, and convertible top motor failures (on convertible models) add to the potential maintenance burden. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as turbocharger replacements or transmission rebuilds, can be quite costly. These issues make a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
