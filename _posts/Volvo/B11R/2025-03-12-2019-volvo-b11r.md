The 2019 Volvo B11R is a coach chassis known for its reliability and comfort, often utilized for long-distance travel. The B11R is equipped with a Volvo D11C engine that outputs 450 horsepower and 1570 lb-ft of torque, paired with the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission. The B11R is generally praised for its smooth ride, fuel efficiency, and robust build quality. However, some common complaints relate to the complexity of the electronics, leading to occasional sensor failures and diagnostic difficulties.

**Engine**

**Volvo D11C**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, poor acceleration, increased emissions, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors can become clogged or fail, leading to misfires, reduced power, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, delayed gear changes, or complete failure to shift. These issues often stem from the valve body, solenoids, or sensor failures within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to pinpoint the issue, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty component. This might involve valve body replacement, solenoid replacement, or sensor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+ (depending on the severity and parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor fails to maintain the correct air pressure in the system, leading to a sagging suspension, a rough ride, and potentially making the vehicle unsafe to drive. The warning light illuminates to indicate that the suspension system has a problem.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Spring Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air springs can develop leaks over time, causing the vehicle to sag on one side or at the front/rear. This leads to an uneven and uncomfortable ride. Hissing sound when the vehicle is running or parked.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per air spring.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors (e.g., ABS sensors, wheel speed sensors, engine temperature sensors) can fail, leading to warning lights on the dashboard, incorrect readings, and potential drivability issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty sensor, followed by sensor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Multiplexing System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The B11R uses a multiplexing system to control various functions. Problems with this system can lead to intermittent electrical issues, such as lights not working, gauges malfunctioning, or even starting problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the multiplexing system, which may involve software updates, module replacement, or wiring repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Lighting Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues with headlights, taillights, or side marker lights can occur. These issues are usually caused by the bulb, but may sometimes be due to wiring or fuses.
    * Solution: Inspect the fuses, wiring, and bulb. Repairing the fuse or wiring and replacing the bulb.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, such as blower motor failure, compressor issues, or blend door actuator problems, can result in inconsistent or non-existent climate control.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the HVAC system, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Volvo B11R is a robust coach chassis, but owners may encounter some issues, primarily relating to engine components like the EGR valve and fuel injectors, as well as transmission problems, air suspension components, and electrical system glitches. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with associated costs varying accordingly. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs can help mitigate these potential problems.
