**Introduction:**

The 2013 Volvo V40 Cross Country is a compact luxury SUV that combines rugged off-road capability with premium features. It is powered by a choice of two engines: a 2.5-liter inline-five and a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four. The former produces 250 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, while the latter churns out 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.
