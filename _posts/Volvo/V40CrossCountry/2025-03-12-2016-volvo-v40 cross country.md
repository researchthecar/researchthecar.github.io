The 2016 Volvo V40 Cross Country is a stylish and practical hatchback that offers a blend of comfort, safety, and Scandinavian design. Engine options vary depending on the market, but commonly include a range of petrol and diesel engines. One popular option is the T5 petrol engine, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing around 245 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine is often paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the V40 Cross Country for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel engines), and advanced safety features. Some criticisms include the somewhat limited rear passenger space and cargo capacity compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**T5 2.0L Petrol Engine**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between service intervals. This can manifest as the low oil level warning light illuminating frequently.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels. In some cases, a PCV valve replacement or piston ring replacement may be necessary if consumption is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the severity and repair needed. PCV valve replacement can be around $200-$400. Piston ring replacement can be a significantly more expensive repair, ranging from $2000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**D4 Diesel Engine**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**Aisin Warner 8-Speed Automatic (TF-80SC)**
*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or hesitant shifting, particularly when cold. This can sometimes be accompanied by a slight "clunk" noise during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Fluid change or valve body replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change $200-$400. Valve body replacement: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorbers Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking rear shock absorbers are sometimes reported, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. This can also manifest as visible oil residue on the shock absorbers themselves.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 for both rear shock absorbers replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, particularly if the car is left unused for several days. This can result in the car being difficult to start or requiring a jump start.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the parasitic drain (e.g., faulty module, improperly closing component). Repair or replacement of the offending component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the cause, ranging from a simple relay replacement ($50-$100) to replacing a module ($300+).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require restarting the system or, in some cases, can affect other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates may be free or low cost from a dealer. Infotainment unit replacement can range from $500 - $1500+ depending on the complexity of the system and parts availability.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Parking Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The parking sensors may occasionally fail or become inaccurate, providing false readings or failing to detect obstacles.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor(s). Replacement of the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per sensor, including labor.

*   **Sunroof Rattles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can sometimes develop rattles or squeaks, particularly when driving over uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Adjusting or lubricating the sunroof mechanism. In some cases, replacement of worn parts may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$300+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Volvo V40 Cross Country, while generally a reliable vehicle, has some known issues. The most concerning are excessive oil consumption in the T5 engine and rough shifting with the 8-speed automatic transmission, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues like battery drain and infotainment system problems can also be frustrating. Suspension and exterior/interior issues are typically less severe and costly to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect any prospective purchase carefully, paying close attention to service history and any signs of the aforementioned issues.
