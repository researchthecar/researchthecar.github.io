The 2014 Volvo V40 Cross Country is a compact hatchback with slightly increased ride height and rugged styling cues, aiming for a blend of practicality and adventurous spirit. Engine options typically include a range of gasoline and diesel engines. A popular choice is the T5 gasoline engine, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing around 245 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options vary depending on the engine and market, often including a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the V40 Cross Country for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and Volvo's reputation for safety. Downsides can include limited rear passenger space compared to some competitors and potentially higher maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.0L T5 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and potentially engine knocking sounds if the oil level becomes critically low.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and topping off as needed. In some cases, a PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve replacement or piston ring replacement might be necessary to address the underlying cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for PCV Valve, $1500 - $4000+ for piston rings.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Diesel Engines (D2, D3, D4)**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clogging of the DPF, particularly in vehicles used primarily for short trips or city driving. Symptoms include reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, DPF warning lights, and potential limp mode activation.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (can sometimes be initiated by the driver), DPF cleaning by a specialist, or DPF replacement. Ensuring the engine reaches operating temperature regularly can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for forced regeneration, $200 - $500 for cleaning, $800 - $2000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin Warner 6-Speed Automatic (TF-80SC)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. These issues are often related to wear and tear or clogging within the valve body.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild, including cleaning and replacing worn solenoids. A transmission fluid flush may help in some cases but is unlikely to resolve severe valve body problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 for fluid flush and diagnostic, $800 - $2000+ for valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. Visible signs of leakage from the shock absorbers are also common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers. It is recommended to replace them in pairs to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per pair, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Electronic Module (CEM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems such as failure of interior lights, malfunctioning power windows, issues with the central locking system, and difficulty starting the vehicle. The CEM controls various electrical functions and can be susceptible to water ingress or internal failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician to confirm the CEM is the source of the problem. Repair or replacement of the CEM, followed by reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 for diagnostic, $500 - $1500+ for CEM repair or replacement, including programming.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of one or more door lock actuators, preventing the door from locking or unlocking with the key fob or interior switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per door, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunction including getting stuck open or closed, failing to open smoothly, or excessive noise during operation. This is often due to motor failure or issues with the track.
    * Solution: Diagnose the root cause to see if track repair or motor replacement is needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 depending on the specific cause.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Volvo V40 Cross Country presents a mix of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with oil consumption and DPF clogging (in diesels), can lead to moderate repair costs. Transmission valve body issues are also a concern. Electrical problems related to the CEM can be frustrating and require specialized diagnosis. Suspension and other component failures contribute to the overall maintenance picture. While some issues may be relatively minor, others, such as CEM or transmission repairs, can be quite expensive. Potential buyers should prioritize a thorough inspection and review maintenance records to assess the vehicle's condition.
