**Introduction:**

The 1998 Volvo V90 is a full-size luxury station wagon that was discontinued in 1998. It was available with a choice of two engines: a 2.9L inline-6 or a 2.9L turbocharged inline-6. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The V90 was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong performance. However, it was criticized for its high price and poor fuel economy.
