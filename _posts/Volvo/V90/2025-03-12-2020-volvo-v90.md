The 2020 Volvo V90 is a stylish and comfortable luxury wagon known for its spacious interior, elegant design, and advanced safety features. Engine options include the T5, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and the T6, a 2.0L turbocharged *and* supercharged inline-4 generating 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate its comfortable ride and premium interior, while others dislike its somewhat complex infotainment system and limited cargo space compared to some SUVs. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**T5 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running rough.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection is recommended. In severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (if piston ring replacement is required)

**T6 2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged Inline-4**

*   **Coolant Leak from Supercharger**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant may leak from the supercharger unit, leading to low coolant levels and potential engine overheating. This may be noticeable with a sweet smell and/or visible coolant pooling around the supercharger.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger unit or the specific coolant lines/seals that are leaking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ depending on parts and labor.

    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty component, which could be the air compressor, air spring, or height sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per air spring, $800 - $2,000+ for the air compressor, $200-$500+ per height sensor.

**Summary**

The 2020 Volvo V90, while praised for its design and comfort, does have a few common issues to be aware of. The most concerning are potential engine problems like excessive oil consumption (T5) and supercharger leaks (T6), which can lead to costly repairs. The infotainment system can also be a source of frustration for some owners. Suspension and transmission issues can also arise. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, it's prudent to have a pre-purchase inspection performed, especially focusing on the engine, transmission, and infotainment system, to avoid any surprises. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances (infotainment glitches) to potentially expensive repairs (engine and suspension).
