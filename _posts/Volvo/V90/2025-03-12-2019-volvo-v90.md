The 2019 Volvo V90 is a stylish and comfortable wagon that offers a luxurious driving experience. Engine options included the T5 (2.0L turbocharged inline-4, 250 hp, 258 lb-ft torque), T6 (2.0L turbocharged and supercharged inline-4, 316 hp, 295 lb-ft torque), and the T8 eAWD Plug-In Hybrid (2.0L turbocharged and supercharged inline-4 + electric motor, 400 hp combined, 472 lb-ft torque). All engine options are paired with an Aisin 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the V90 for its elegant design, comfortable interior, and advanced safety features. Common dislikes include the sometimes-frustrating infotainment system and the limited cargo space compared to some competitors.
