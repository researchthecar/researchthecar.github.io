The 2021 Volvo V90 is a stylish and comfortable wagon known for its luxurious interior, smooth ride, and advanced safety features. Engine options include the T5, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and the T6, a turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder generating 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The T6 engine is what you will find in the B6 configuration. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the V90's elegant design, spacious cargo area, and comfortable seats. Some common dislikes include the somewhat complex infotainment system and limited availability in certain markets.

**Engine**

**T5 (2.0L Turbocharged I4)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent topping off between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust can be a symptom.
    *   Solution: Initially, monitoring oil levels closely and using the manufacturer-recommended oil is advised. If consumption persists, a dealer inspection to check for leaks, piston ring issues, or valve seal problems is necessary. More aggressive fixes would be replacing the PCV valve or replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+

**T6/B6 (2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged I4)**

*   **Supercharger Clutch Noise/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A whining or rattling noise from the engine, particularly at lower speeds, is a common symptom. The supercharger clutch might eventually fail, leading to reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the supercharger clutch assembly is the typical fix. In some cases, the entire supercharger unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+

**Transmission**

**Aisin Warner TG-81SC 8-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifts, particularly between lower gears. This can be accompanied by a noticeable "clunk" or "jerk". The problem may be exacerbated when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the Transmission Control Module (TCM) can resolve the issue. More involved solutions include valve body replacement or, in rare cases, a full transmission replacement. Fluid changes may also assist in solving the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $6,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some V90 models are equipped with rear air suspension. Problems can include the suspension compressor failing, leading to the rear of the car sagging or not maintaining proper ride height. Leaks in the air springs are also possible.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty compressor or air spring is the typical solution. It's important to diagnose the leak source properly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system can be prone to occasional freezing, slow response times, or spontaneous rebooting. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update is often the first step. If the problem persists, a dealer visit may be needed to diagnose hardware issues within the infotainment system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (hardware replacement)

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car battery draining prematurely, especially if the car is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly check for any aftermarket accessories that may be drawing power. Have the battery and charging system tested by a qualified technician. A parasitic draw test may be necessary to identify the source of the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate can sometimes fail to open or close properly, or it may become misaligned. This is typically due to a faulty motor, sensor, or hinge.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected motor, sensor, or hinge is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can experience problems such as getting stuck, making excessive noise during operation, or leaking.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks may resolve minor issues. More significant problems may require replacement of the sunroof motor or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+

**Recalls:**

*   **Recall Number: 21V928000**
    *   Description: The high-voltage coolant heater may corrode internally and cause an electrical short circuit.
    *   Solution: Dealers will inspect and replace the high-voltage coolant heater, free of charge.

**Summary:**

The 2021 Volvo V90 is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners have reported issues with the engine (especially the supercharger on T6/B6 models), transmission, electrical system, and air suspension (if equipped). The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences like infotainment glitches to more costly repairs such as supercharger or transmission replacements. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase, especially checking for any signs of rough shifting, unusual engine noises, or electrical malfunctions. Software updates and proper maintenance can help mitigate some of these issues.
