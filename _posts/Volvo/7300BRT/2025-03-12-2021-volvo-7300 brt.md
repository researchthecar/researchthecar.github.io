The 2021 Volvo 7300 BRT is a popular choice for public transportation, known for its reliability and comfort. It is equipped with the Volvo D8 engine, a 7.7-liter inline-six diesel engine producing around 330 horsepower and 995 lb-ft of torque. While specific data on other engine options for this model are limited, the D8 is the most prevalent. Users generally praise the bus for its smooth ride, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency relative to its size. Common complaints revolve around the complexity of the electronic systems and the potential for costly repairs related to emissions controls.

**Engine**

**Volvo D8**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, frequent regeneration cycles, and the "check engine" light illuminating.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration by a technician, DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement if cleaning is ineffective.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the solution and extent of damage to the DPF or other emissions components.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor engine performance, increased emissions, and potential engine stalling. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to EGR flow issues.
    * Solution: EGR valve replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ depending on labor and parts costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, reduced fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and difficulty starting.
    * Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the faulty injector(s) and replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector depending on labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*No Engine Option Specified*

* **Allison Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement, slipping between gears, harsh shifting, and unusual noises from the transmission.
    * Solution: Diagnosis may require software update, valve body repair/replacement, or complete transmission overhaul/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8000+ depending on the severity of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible fluid leaks under the vehicle, difficulty shifting, and transmission overheating.
    * Solution: Identify and repair the leak source (seals, gaskets, lines). Top off or replace transmission fluid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the location and complexity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging or uneven ride height, longer inflation times, and potential "air suspension fault" warnings.
    * Solution: Air compressor replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Air Spring Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gradual deflation of the suspension, leading to a lower ride height and compromised ride quality. Hissing sounds from the suspension components.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking air spring(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per air spring.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Multiplexing System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical faults, such as malfunctioning lights, door controls, or instrument panel displays. Communication errors between electronic control units (ECUs).
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician with experience in multiplexing systems. Could involve software updates, wiring repairs, or ECU replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CAN Bus Communication Errors**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various seemingly unrelated electrical malfunctions due to communication breakdown between modules.
    * Solution: Diagnosis with specialized tools to identify the faulty module or wiring. Repair/replacement of the affected components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3000+ depending on the fault.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
