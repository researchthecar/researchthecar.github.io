### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Volvo 7300 BRT demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the complex emission control systems (EGR coolers), turbochargers, and specific transmission components like the torque converter, especially under high-mileage, demanding urban operations. Electrical system gremlins, particularly with the multiplex wiring, can be complex to diagnose but are not necessarily widespread. Suspension components, especially the air springs and control valves, require attention due to their role in ride comfort and kneeling functionality. Proactive maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to mitigating repair costs and ensuring consistent fleet availability.
