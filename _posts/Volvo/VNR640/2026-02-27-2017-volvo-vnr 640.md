### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volvo VNR 640 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to emissions systems (EGR coolers, DPFs) and specific transmission control elements, especially with the I-Shift automated manual. Electrical system integrity and exterior component durability are generally sound, though moisture ingress into lighting can occur. Interior comfort features like the HVAC and driver's seat are susceptible to wear and tear on actuators and air components. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning the emissions system and regular checks of air suspension, is key to maximizing the longevity and minimizing unexpected downtime of the VNR 640.
