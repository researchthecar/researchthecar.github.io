The 2017 Volvo 9700 is a luxury coach bus often used for long-distance travel. While specific engine options are somewhat dependent on regional market configurations, it commonly features Volvo's D11 or D13 engine variants. The D13 engine, for example, typically produces between 425-500 horsepower and upwards of 1750 lb-ft of torque. Operators and passengers alike appreciate the 9700 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and safety features. Some common dislikes involve the complexities of modern bus electronics and the higher maintenance costs associated with advanced engine technologies and air suspension systems.

**Engine**

**D13 Engine**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive coolant consumption, white smoke from the exhaust, and engine overheating. This is often caused by cracks in the EGR cooler due to thermal stress.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, and a DPF warning light. This can be caused by a buildup of soot and ash within the filter.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (cleaning) or DPF replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (for cleaning) - $4,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Shift Hesitation or Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delays in shifting gears, rough or jerky shifts, and occasional slipping. This is often related to worn clutch packs or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Clutch adjustment or replacement, valve body repair or replacement, transmission software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 (for software update/adjustment) - $6,000+ (for full clutch/valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks from the transmission housing, low transmission fluid levels, and potential slipping or failure. Often related to seals or gaskets.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaking seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The bus leans to one side, the ride height is incorrect, or the air suspension warning light is illuminated. The compressor may be making excessive noise or not running at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Spring Leaks**

    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per air spring
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Multiplexing System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical components malfunctioning intermittently, such as lights, wipers, or climate control. This can be caused by faulty control modules or wiring harness problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the multiplexing system, which may involve replacing control modules or repairing wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Problems**

**Summary**

The 2017 Volvo 9700, while a comfortable and reliable coach, does experience some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the D13 variant, often involve EGR cooler failures and DPF clogging, leading to costly repairs. The I-Shift transmission can suffer from shifting problems and oil leaks. The air suspension system is also a potential area of concern. Electrical issues related to the multiplexing system can be difficult to diagnose and expensive to repair. While some issues are relatively minor, others can result in significant downtime and repair bills. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and obtain service records to assess the vehicle's overall condition.
