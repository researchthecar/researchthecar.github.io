The 2019 Volvo 9700 is a premium coach bus known for its comfort, safety features, and fuel efficiency. Engine options typically include Volvo's D11 and D13 diesel engines, paired with Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. The D13 engine often boasts around 425-500 horsepower and 1650-1850 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise its smooth ride, spacious interior, and advanced safety systems. Common dislikes include the higher upfront cost and potential for complex repairs.

**Engine**

**D13 Engine**
*   **DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, leading to reduced fuel economy. Clogging of the DPF can trigger warning lights and eventually lead to engine derating.
    *   Solution: Regular DPF cleaning or replacement. Ensuring proper engine maintenance and using high-quality fuel can help prevent premature DPF clogging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on cleaning vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, increased emissions, and potential engine stalling. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to EGR flow may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty EGR valve. Cleaning the EGR cooler can also help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Shifting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, delayed engagement, or failure to shift properly. These issues can be more pronounced at lower speeds or during uphill driving.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) can often resolve minor shifting issues. More severe problems may require valve body replacement or complete transmission overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+ (for software updates), $2,000 - $8,000+ (for more extensive repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension System Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging of the vehicle on one or more sides, hissing sounds coming from the air suspension components, and a rougher ride quality. The air compressor may run continuously in an attempt to maintain the correct ride height.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing leaks in the air lines, air springs (bags), or leveling valves. Replacing worn or damaged air suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ (depending on the component needing repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Multiplexing System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failures of various electrical components, such as lighting, climate control, or entertainment systems. Diagnostic messages related to CAN bus communication errors may be present.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the multiplexing system to identify faulty modules or wiring. Repairing or replacing affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, resulting in difficulty starting the engine or complete battery failure. This can be caused by parasitic drains from aftermarket accessories or faulty electrical components.
    *   Solution: Testing for parasitic draws and isolating the source of the drain. Replacing the battery if it is no longer holding a charge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **LED Lighting Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of LED headlights, taillights, or marker lights. This can be caused by water intrusion or overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty LED lighting units. Ensuring proper sealing of the lighting housings can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per light (depending on the specific light and the labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent heating or cooling, blower motor failures, or unusual noises coming from the HVAC system. Problems with the climate control settings.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of faulty HVAC components, such as the blower motor, compressor, or blend door actuators. Recharge the freon.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Volvo 9700, while a generally reliable coach bus, can experience issues related to its emissions control systems (DPF, EGR), transmission, suspension, and electrical components. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue, ranging from relatively minor software updates to more extensive component replacements. Addressing these issues promptly through regular maintenance and inspections can help ensure the continued reliable operation of the vehicle.
