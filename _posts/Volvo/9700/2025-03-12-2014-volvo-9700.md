The 2014 Volvo 9700 is a popular coach bus known for its comfort, safety features, and reliability. Typically powered by a Volvo D13 engine, it provides a good balance of power and fuel efficiency. This engine option generally produces around 425-500 horsepower and 1550-1750 lb-ft of torque. Common transmissions are Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Owners often praise its smooth ride, spacious interior, and advanced safety systems, but some common complaints include issues with the multiplexing system and some wear items related to its heavy-duty usage.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**
* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust. This occurs when the EGR cooler cracks, allowing coolant to enter the exhaust stream.
    * Solution: Replace the EGR cooler. Ensure proper coolant levels are maintained and inspect the EGR system regularly for leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, engine misfires, check engine light. Fuel injectors can become clogged or fail due to fuel contamination or wear.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector and replace it. Cleaning the fuel system and using high-quality fuel can prevent future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift**

* **Shifting Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed shifting, harsh shifting, inability to shift into certain gears, error codes. This can be due to sensor failures, solenoid problems, or issues with the transmission control module (TCM).
    * Solution: Diagnose the cause using diagnostic tools. Replace faulty sensors, solenoids, or repair/replace the TCM. Ensure proper fluid levels and regular maintenance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ (depending on the issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Clutch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, grinding noises. This can occur due to normal wear and tear, especially in high-mileage vehicles.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch assembly, including the pressure plate, friction disc, and release bearing. Inspect the flywheel for damage and resurface or replace as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Component Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride height, air leaks, hissing sounds, poor ride quality. Air bags, air lines, leveling valves, or the air compressor can fail.
    * Solution: Identify the leaking component and replace it. Check the air compressor for proper operation and repair or replace as needed. Inspect air lines for cracks or leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Multiplexing System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights not working, instrument panel errors, or climate control malfunctions. The multiplexing system controls various electrical functions and can be prone to software glitches or wiring issues.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific problem using diagnostic tools. Update software as needed, repair wiring, or replace faulty control modules.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, low voltage, frequent battery drain. Batteries can fail prematurely, especially in vehicles with high electrical loads or infrequent use.
    * Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Replace the battery if necessary and check for parasitic drains.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    * Solution: Remove the headlight housing and dry it out. Seal any cracks or leaks in the housing to prevent moisture intrusion. Replacing the headlight housing may be necessary in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent temperatures, poor airflow, failure to switch between hot and cold. Issues can stem from faulty blend door actuators, blower motor problems, or refrigerant leaks.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific problem and replace faulty components, such as the blend door actuator or blower motor. Repair any refrigerant leaks and recharge the system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Volvo 9700, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine and transmission problems, especially those related to the EGR system, fuel injectors, and the I-Shift transmission, can be costly to repair. Electrical issues with the multiplexing system can also be frustrating. Suspension and interior problems, such as air suspension failures and HVAC malfunctions, can affect ride comfort. While not all 2014 Volvo 9700s will experience these problems, it's important to be aware of them when considering purchasing one and to factor potential repair costs into your budget.
