The 2011 Volvo 9700 is a luxury coach known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. It's favored for long-distance travel and touring purposes. The 2011 model came with a Volvo D13 engine, a 12.8-liter inline-six diesel engine, typically producing around 500 horsepower and 1750 lb-ft of torque, paired with an I-Shift automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the smooth ride and fuel efficiency, but some common dislikes include the complexity of the electrical systems and the cost of replacement parts.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13 (12.8L Inline-Six Diesel)**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler cracking, leading to coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, and potential engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the EGR cooler with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, and DPF warning light illumination. This is often caused by short trips and infrequent high-speed driving.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF or replacement if severely clogged. Addressing underlying issues like faulty injectors or excessive oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty fuel injectors and recalibrating the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Shift Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delay in shifting gears, jerky or abrupt shifts, and potential slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM), replacement of faulty solenoids within the transmission, or complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, and complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly, including the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Component Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking air bags, air lines, or ride height control valves, leading to uneven ride height, compressor running constantly, and poor ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty air bags, air lines, or ride height control valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Multiplexing System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failures of various electrical components, such as lights, wipers, or climate control. Difficult to diagnose due to the complex nature of the system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician with experience in Volvo multiplexing systems. Replacing faulty modules or wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Display Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illumination failure, flickering, or inaccurate readings on the instrument cluster.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent heating or cooling, blower motor failures, or malfunctioning temperature controls.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty blower motors, actuators, or control modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Volvo 9700, while generally reliable, can experience issues related to its diesel engine, automated manual transmission, air suspension, and complex electrical systems. The most common complaints revolve around EGR cooler failures, DPF clogging, transmission shifting problems, and air suspension leaks. The cost of repairs can vary significantly, from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission overhauls. Thorough inspections and proactive maintenance can help minimize the risk of these issues.
