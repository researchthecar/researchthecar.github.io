### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volvo 9700 demonstrates a commendable level of reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and structural components. The primary areas where owners might encounter issues are related to the advanced emission control systems (DEF injectors, EGR coolers) and the sophisticated automated transmission (I-Shift clutch actuators, TCM). Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or infotainment system, can also arise. However, these are generally addressable with proper diagnostics and component replacement. The exterior and interior, barring typical wear, are robust. Proactive maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are key to maintaining the 9700's operational efficiency and longevity.
