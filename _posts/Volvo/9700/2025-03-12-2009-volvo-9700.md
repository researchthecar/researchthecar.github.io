    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced fuel economy, black smoke from exhaust, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the faulty injector(s) and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (per injector)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, unusual noises (whining or screeching) from the turbocharger, and potential engine damage.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Input Shaft Seal Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leaks, especially around the front of the transmission, leading to low fluid levels and potential transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the input shaft seal, inspection of the input shaft and surrounding components for wear or damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension System Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging of the bus on one or more sides, extended time for the suspension to level, hissing noises from air leaks, and potential ride quality issues.
    *   Solution: Inspection of air bags, air lines, leveling valves, and air compressors for leaks or damage. Replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (per component)
