The 2018 Volvo 9700 is a popular choice for long-distance touring and charter bus services, prized for its comfort, safety features, and fuel efficiency. Engine options typically include Volvo's D11 and D13 series diesel engines. For example, the D13 engine could produce around 425-500 horsepower and 1650-1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Transmissions are usually Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Operators generally appreciate the smooth ride, passenger amenities, and Volvo's reputation for reliability. However, some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the electronics, leading to diagnostic challenges, and the cost of replacement parts.
