The 2016 Volvo XC90 is a luxury SUV that marked a significant step for Volvo, introducing a new design language and advanced technology. It came with engine options including a 2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged inline-4 engine (T6), producing around 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4 engine (T5) producing around 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a plug-in hybrid version (T8). All models were equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the XC90 for its comfortable interior, stylish design, and advanced safety features, but some have reported issues with the infotainment system and certain mechanical components.
