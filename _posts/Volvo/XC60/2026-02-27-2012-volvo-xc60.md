### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Volvo XC60 offers a solid ownership experience with a strong emphasis on safety. While it doesn't suffer from widespread, catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of potential issues related to the PCV system and oil leaks on the inline-6 engines, and turbocharger concerns on the turbocharged variants. Transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting, can occur and may require professional attention. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from water ingress, are also a point to monitor. Regular maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission and proactive checks for leaks, will significantly contribute to the long-term reliability of this Volvo SUV.
