The 2012 Volvo XC60 is a compact luxury SUV known for its safety features, comfortable ride, and stylish design. Engine options included a 3.2-liter inline-6 producing 240 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 offering 300 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque (T6). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the XC60's comfortable seats and solid build quality, while some dislike its fuel economy and occasionally complex electronic systems.

**Summary**

The 2012 Volvo XC60, while generally reliable, can suffer from several common issues. Engine problems can range from relatively minor oil leaks to more significant turbocharger failures (specifically the T6 models), while transmission issues primarily revolve around valve body and torque converter problems in the Aisin Warner TF-80SC. Suspension components, particularly strut mounts and rear shocks, may require replacement. Electrical glitches and battery drain are also reported. The cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the issue, ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major repairs. While not every XC60 will experience all of these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic prior to purchase.
