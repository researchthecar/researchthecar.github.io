### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Volvo XC60 generally offers good reliability, particularly with its robust safety systems and comfortable interior. Common issues tend to be concentrated in areas like the electrical system (battery drain, infotainment glitches) and specific engine components, especially on the turbocharged and diesel variants (turbocharger, DPF, EGR). Transmission issues, while not widespread, can manifest as harsh shifting. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear over time, and optional adaptive suspension systems may require costly repairs if they fail. Addressing potential oil leaks and ensuring proper maintenance of the climate control and interior features will contribute to a more positive ownership experience. Overall, it remains a solid choice for those prioritizing safety and comfort, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific technical considerations.
