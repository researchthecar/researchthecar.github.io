### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Volvo XC60 demonstrates good overall reliability, with most owners reporting a positive experience. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the advanced hybrid powertrain (T8 model) and the sophisticated infotainment system, which can occasionally exhibit glitches. The optional air suspension is another component that has seen some reports of issues. However, these are not universally experienced and often fall within the expected range for vehicles with complex technology. Standard components and the core mechanicals of the mild-hybrid and non-hybrid variants are generally robust. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are recommended, especially for the hybrid system.
