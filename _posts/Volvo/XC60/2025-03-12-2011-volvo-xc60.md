The 2011 Volvo XC60 is a compact luxury SUV known for its safety features, comfortable ride, and Scandinavian design. Available engine options included a 3.2L naturally aspirated inline-6 producing 240 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 3.0L inline-6 producing 300 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the XC60 for its comfortable seats, spacious interior, and distinctive styling. Common complaints include a somewhat dated infotainment system and occasionally finicky electronics.
