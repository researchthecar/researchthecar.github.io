### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volvo XC60 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly when considering its luxury and safety focus. The most frequently reported technical concerns tend to revolve around the powertrain, specifically issues with turbochargers on gasoline engines and DPF/EGR systems on diesel variants. Transmission shudder can also be a point of attention. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon.
