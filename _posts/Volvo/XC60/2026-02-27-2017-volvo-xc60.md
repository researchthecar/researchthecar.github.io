### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volvo XC60 is generally a reliable vehicle, particularly with its core mechanical components. The T5 engine and the standard automatic transmission show a strong track record with minimal reported issues. The more complex T6 engine, with its twin-charging system, can occasionally present coolant leaks, and some owners have noted issues with the PCV system on the larger 3.0L turbo engine. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are the most frequently cited non-wear-and-tear problems. Overall, the XC60 offers good reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine variants and the possibility of minor electrical faults.
