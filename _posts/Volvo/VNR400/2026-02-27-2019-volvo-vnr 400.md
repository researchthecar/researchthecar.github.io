### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Volvo VNR 400 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the aftertreatment systems (DPF/SCR) for the D13 engine and potential EGR cooler leaks on the D11, which are common in modern diesel technology. Transmission reliability, especially with the I-Shift, is generally strong, though actuator or module issues can arise. Electrical gremlins, often related to wiring harness integrity in vocational applications, are also a point to monitor. Proactive maintenance, adherence to service intervals, and prompt attention to warning lights are key to maximizing the uptime and longevity of the VNR 400.
