### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volvo VNR 400 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly for its intended vocational use. The most frequently cited technical issues tend to be related to the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, fuel injectors, and the automated manual transmission's clutch actuator, especially on the I-Shift. Diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration issues can also arise, particularly with heavy-duty cycles. Electrical system components like alternators and wiring connections require attention over time. However, many of these are manageable with proactive maintenance and timely repairs. The manual transmission options and core structural components generally exhibit robust performance. Fleet operators should prioritize regular diagnostics and address warning lights promptly to maintain optimal uptime and prevent more costly repairs.
