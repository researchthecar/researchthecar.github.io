The 2018 Volvo VNR 400 is a regional haul tractor designed for efficiency and driver comfort. Engine options included the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins X15, paired primarily with the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission. The Volvo D13 engine produces between 405 to 500 horsepower and 1450 to 1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Owners appreciate the VNR's comfortable cab, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability. Common complaints often center around the complexity of the Volvo electrical systems and the cost of proprietary parts.

**Summary**

The 2018 Volvo VNR 400, while appreciated for its comfort and efficiency, does present some common issues. Engine-related problems like EGR cooler failures and fuel injector issues can be costly, as can DPF problems on Cummins-equipped models. The I-Shift transmission can experience slipping and shifting issues, and electrical problems, including sensor failures and wiring harness issues, can be frustrating to diagnose. Air spring leaks are common suspension problems. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major repairs, with repair costs spanning from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Thorough inspection and preventative maintenance are crucial for minimizing these potential problems.
