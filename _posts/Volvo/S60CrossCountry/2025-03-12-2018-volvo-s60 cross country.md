The 2018 Volvo S60 Cross Country is a unique offering, blending the sleekness of a sedan with the ruggedness of a crossover. It was only offered with one engine option, the turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the comfortable ride, distinctive styling, and standard all-wheel drive. However, some criticisms include a somewhat cramped rear seat and limited cargo space compared to traditional SUVs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (B4204T11)**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Visible blue smoke may be present upon startup or acceleration.
    * Solution: The PCV valve may be faulty, which causes excess vacuum in the crankcase, increasing oil consumption. Replacing the PCV valve may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine rebuild may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (PCV Valve), $2,000 - $5,000+ (Piston Rings/Rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various sources, including the water pump, radiator hoses, or the coolant reservoir. Low coolant levels and overheating are common symptoms.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin Warner TG-81SC 8-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop can also occur.
    * Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush or replacement of the valve body may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (Software Update), $300 - $600 (Fluid Flush), $800 - $1,500+ (Valve Body)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Air Suspension Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The S60 Cross Country features a self-leveling rear suspension using air springs. Some owners have reported issues with these air springs, including leaks, compressor failures, and uneven ride height.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking air spring(s). Replace the air compressor if it is not functioning properly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ per air spring, $400 - $800+ for the compressor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can occur, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    * Solution: Check for parasitic draws by testing the current draw when the vehicle is off. A faulty module can cause a parasitic draw. Replace the battery if it is old or tests poorly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (Battery Replacement), $100+ (Diagnosis and parasitic draw fix).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system can sometimes experience glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, or connectivity issues with smartphones.
    * Solution: Software updates from Volvo can often address these glitches. A hard reset of the system may also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update), $0 (Hard Reset), $100+ (Diagnosis if more complex)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the sunroof mechanism, including difficulty opening or closing, unusual noises, or leaks.
    * Solution: Inspect and lubricate the sunroof tracks. Replace any damaged or worn components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Volvo S60 Cross Country generally presents a blend of comfort and capability. The most prevalent issues appear to be related to the engine's oil consumption, the transmission's shifting quality, and the rear air suspension. While some electrical and interior problems exist, they are less frequent. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences requiring software updates to more significant repairs like engine work, potentially leading to costs from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. It is important to look out for the issues while purchasing the car and to do the proper maintenance.
