The 2017 Volvo S60 Cross Country is a unique vehicle, blending the practicality of a sedan with the rugged appeal of a crossover. It was only available with a single engine option, the T5, a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with an Aisin 8-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Owners often praise the S60 Cross Country for its comfortable ride, distinctive styling, and standard safety features. Criticisms often center on the infotainment system's complexity and the vehicle's relatively high price point compared to its competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (T5)**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. The rate of consumption varies, but can be significant enough to warrant concern. Symptoms include low oil warning lights or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Addressing this issue often involves first determining the cause of the oil consumption. A dealer may perform an oil consumption test to track oil levels over a set period. Potential causes range from worn piston rings or valve seals to issues with the PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system. Repair options include replacing faulty components (like piston rings or valve seals) or addressing PCV system problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported coolant loss without any visible external leaks. Symptoms include low coolant level warning lights and the need to frequently top off the coolant reservoir.
    *   Solution: Coolant loss in these cars can be caused by the coolant expansion tank cracking or leaking due to age or heat exposure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly when shifting between lower gears or during initial acceleration. Symptoms may include a noticeable clunking or lurching sensation.
    *   Solution: This issue can sometimes be addressed with a transmission fluid flush and software update. In more severe cases, valve body issues or wear within the transmission may necessitate repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush and software update) to $4,000+ (transmission repair or replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly when going over bumps or uneven road surfaces. Symptoms include excessive body roll during cornering and noticeable noises coming from the rear suspension.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (both left and right) to ensure balanced suspension performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (including parts and labor for both sides).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system can be prone to freezing, crashing, or exhibiting slow response times. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Initial troubleshooting steps often involve performing a system reset or software update. In some cases, hardware issues may necessitate component replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) to $1,000+ (for hardware replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with the car battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits unused for an extended period. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or requiring a jump start.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking for parasitic drains (components that continue to draw power even when the car is off). Potential causes include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery. Repair options range from replacing the battery to addressing the source of the parasitic drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (battery replacement) to $500+ (diagnosing and repairing parasitic drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the sunroof, including difficulty opening or closing, unusual noises during operation, or leaks.
    *   Solution: The specific repair depends on the cause of the problem. It may involve lubricating the sunroof tracks, replacing faulty motors or switches, or addressing sealing issues to prevent leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the severity of the issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters failing to operate or becoming excessively hot.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis will involve checking the seat heater elements, switches, and wiring. Repair options may include replacing faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Volvo S60 Cross Country presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine-related concerns, particularly oil consumption, can be significant in terms of both inconvenience and potential repair costs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also relatively common annoyances. Suspension and interior issues are less prevalent but still worth noting. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor them into their purchasing decision. The cost to address these problems can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for more extensive work.
