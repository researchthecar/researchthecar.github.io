It is powered by a 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-5 engine that delivers 250 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. The engine is mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission, offering a smooth and responsive driving experience. While the S60 Cross Country is known for its reliability and safety, it has experienced some issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-5**

- **Turbocharger Failure:** Failing turbochargers can cause loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and a rattling noise. Repair involves replacing the turbocharger and related components. $2,000 - $3,000+
- **Intake Manifold Leaks:** Leaks in the intake manifold can lead to poor engine performance, vacuum leaks, and reduced fuel economy. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. $500 - $700+
- **Timing Chain Stretch:** Excessive stretching of the timing chain can cause a noisy engine, reduced power, and potential engine damage. Replacing the timing chain is necessary, along with any damaged components. $2,500 - $4,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

- **Transmission Slipping:** Sudden or gradual loss of power while driving indicates a slipping transmission. The fix typically involves replacing worn clutches or seals. $2,000 - $3,500+
- **Valve Body Issues:** Malfunctioning valve bodies can cause erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and transmission shuddering. Repair involves replacing the valve body or solenoid packs. $1,000 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

- **Front Strut Mount Failure:** Worn or damaged front strut mounts can lead to a rattling noise, reduced handling, and uneven tire wear. Replacing the strut mounts is necessary. $500 - $800+
- **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks:** Leaking rear shock absorbers can compromise ride quality, stability, and braking performance. Shock absorber replacement is required. $800 - $1,200+

**Electrical**

- **Battery Drain:** Premature battery drain can occur due to parasitic losses or faulty electrical components. Diagnosis and repair of the underlying issue is necessary. $100 - $500+
- **Electrical Module Failures:** Various electrical modules, such as the powertrain control module or body control module, can fail, causing electronic malfunctions and warning light illumination. Module replacement is required. $1,000 - $2,000+

**Exterior**

- **Headlight Condensation:** Buildup of moisture inside the headlight assemblies can occur, affecting visibility. The fix involves replacing the headlight seals and drying the assembly. $300 - $500+
