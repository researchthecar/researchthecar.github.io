The 2016 Volvo V40 is a stylish and practical hatchback, known for its safety features and comfortable ride. Engine options vary depending on the market, but commonly include petrol and diesel engines. A popular petrol engine is the T3, a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing around 150 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the V40's refined interior, comfortable seats, and comprehensive safety equipment. Downsides often mentioned are the relatively small rear passenger space and infotainment system datedness compared to newer models.

**Engine**

**T3 1.5L Petrol**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption in the T3 engine, especially in higher mileage examples. This can manifest as the low oil level warning light illuminating frequently.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and top up as needed. In severe cases, a compression test might be necessary to check for internal wear. Replacing piston rings and valve stem seals may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the work.

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure, characterized by a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining or whistling), and/or the engine management light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger is the usual fix. Ensure the replacement unit is of high quality and that the oil feed lines are clean and properly functioning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+ including labor.

**Diesel Engines (D2, D3, D4)**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common in diesel engines, particularly those used mainly for short journeys, the DPF can become clogged. Symptoms include reduced engine power, the DPF warning light illuminating, and increased fuel consumption.
    *   Solution: Attempt a forced DPF regeneration. If unsuccessful, the DPF may need to be cleaned or replaced. Ensure the car is driven regularly on longer journeys to promote DPF regeneration.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for cleaning, $800 - $2000+ for replacement.

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and the engine management light illuminating.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifts between gears, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can be accompanied by clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change using the correct Volvo-specified fluid. If the problem persists, valve body issues or solenoid failures may be the cause, requiring further diagnosis and repair or replacement of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid and filter, $800 - $2000+ for valve body repair/replacement.

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or thumping noises from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps. The car may also feel less stable or controlled in corners.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers. It's recommended to replace them in pairs for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ including labor for both sides.

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Try a software update of the infotainment system. If the problem persists, the unit may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update, $500 - $1500+ for infotainment system replacement (aftermarket or used options may be cheaper).

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car battery draining quickly, especially when left parked for a few days. This can be caused by parasitic drain from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: A professional electrical system diagnosis is required to identify the source of the drain. This may involve testing individual circuits and modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for diagnosis, variable depending on the cause. Battery replacement $150-$300

**Exterior**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door locks may fail to operate correctly, either not locking/unlocking with the remote or the interior door switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per door.

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, fail to open or close smoothly, or make unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the sunroof tracks. If the problem persists, the sunroof motor or mechanism may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 for lubrication, $300 - $1000+ for motor/mechanism repair or replacement.

**Recalls**

*   **R01291 - Fuel Hose**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to a potential manufacturing defect in the fuel hose, cracks may form which can lead to fuel leakage. A fuel leak in the presence of an ignition source can increase the risk of a fire.
    *   Solution: Dealers will replace the fuel hose, free of charge.
*   **R01285 - Airbag Control Unit (ACU)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A software error in the Airbag Control Unit (ACU) may cause the airbags and seatbelt pretensioners to deploy unexpectedly during a collision.
    *   Solution: Dealers will update the ACU software, free of charge.
*   **R01228 - Engine Cooling Fan**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine cooling fan may malfunction, potentially leading to overheating of the engine.
    *   Solution: Dealers will replace the engine cooling fan, free of charge.

**Summary**

The 2016 Volvo V40 has a few common issues to be aware of. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption and turbocharger issues on the T3 petrol engine, and DPF/EGR concerns on the diesel models, can be costly. Transmission issues, mainly rough shifting, can also be a factor. Electrical and interior issues are generally less frequent but should be considered. Suspension and exterior issues such as worn shocks and door lock actuators can also occur. Overall, potential buyers should have the vehicle inspected thoroughly, especially looking for signs of these common issues, and check for any outstanding recalls. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the chosen repair method.
