### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Volvo V40 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly known for its safety features. Common issues tend to be concentrated in areas like the turbocharged engine's ancillary components (turbocharger, ignition coils) and the automatic transmission, which can develop leaks or solenoid problems. Suspension components, especially bushings and strut mounts, are also areas to inspect due to age and mileage. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and ABS sensors, can also arise. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these potential issues are typical for a car of this vintage and should be considered during ownership.
