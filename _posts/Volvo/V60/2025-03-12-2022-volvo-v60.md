The 2022 Volvo V60 is a stylish and practical wagon that offers a blend of Scandinavian design, comfortable driving, and advanced safety features. The V60 lineup for 2022 offered several powertrain options. The T5 was a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The T6 added a supercharger to the 2.0-liter four-cylinder, boosting output to 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque.

**Summary**

The 2022 Volvo V60 experiences some common issues, primarily related to the infotainment system and transmission. The electrical gremlins in the infotainment can be frustrating, and the transmission issues can be concerning due to their potential cost and impact on drivability. The Recharge T8 version may also experience issues with its high-voltage coolant heater, reducing the efficiency of the hybrid system. While some issues can be resolved with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs, more serious problems like transmission or infotainment unit replacements can be costly. The sunroof leak issue is less frequent, but it is definitely worth noting. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, including budgeting for potential repairs and checking for any applicable recalls or technical service bulletins (TSBs).
