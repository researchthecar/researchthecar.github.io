### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Volvo V60 demonstrates strong reliability across most of its core mechanical components, including the engine (for non-hybrid variants) and transmission. The primary areas where minor concerns have been noted are within the complex electrical and hybrid systems. Infotainment software glitches and occasional sensor issues for driver assistance features are the most frequently reported, though typically resolvable with software updates or recalibration. The plug-in hybrid variants, while offering excellent efficiency, present a slightly higher potential for hybrid system-specific issues. Overall, the V60 is a reliable choice, with most potential problems being manageable and not indicative of fundamental design flaws.
