The 2018 Volvo V60 is a stylish and practical wagon, offering a blend of Scandinavian design, comfort, and safety. The V60 was available with several engine options including the T5 (2.0L turbocharged inline-4, around 240 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque), the T6 (2.0L turbocharged and supercharged inline-4, around 302 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque), and the Polestar variant (2.0L turbocharged and supercharged inline-4, around 362 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque). All engines were generally paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the V60 for its comfortable ride, spacious cargo area, and distinctive styling. Some common complaints involve the infotainment system's complexity and higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L T5 (Turbocharged)**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust can sometimes be observed.
    *   Solution: The fix can range from replacing the PCV valve ($150-300) to piston ring replacement, which involves a more extensive engine overhaul. A leak-down test can help determine the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L T6 (Turbocharged and Supercharged)**

*   **Coolant Leak from Water Pump/Supercharger**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur around the supercharger area, often originating from the water pump or connections to the supercharger's intercooler. This can result in low coolant levels and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the water pump and/or associated hoses and seals. Some cases require replacement of the supercharger assembly if it's determined to be the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin Warner 8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush *may* resolve minor issues. More significant problems might require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild. Diagnostic software and tools must be used to properly diagnose the issue as some reported issues have turned out to be related to the ECU needing software updates and not the transmission itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking rear shock absorbers, especially on vehicles with higher mileage. This can cause a bouncy ride and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system can experience occasional glitches, including screen freezes, slow response times, and Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In some cases, the infotainment system module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Free (software update) - $1,200+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the parasitic draw. This might involve checking for aftermarket accessories that are drawing power or replacing a faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck in position, fail to close completely, or make excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks. In more severe cases, the sunroof motor or entire assembly may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Delamination of Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vinyl or leather on the dashboard may peel off or delaminate.
    * Solution: Replacement of the entire dashboard or professional repair/reupholstering.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Volvo V60, while generally a reliable and enjoyable vehicle, can experience some common issues. Engine oil consumption, cooling system leaks on T6 models, transmission shifting problems, infotainment system glitches, and potential battery drain are the most frequently reported problems. Repair costs can range from relatively minor fixes like software updates to more substantial repairs such as engine or transmission work. Before purchasing a used 2018 V60, it is wise to have it inspected by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems.
