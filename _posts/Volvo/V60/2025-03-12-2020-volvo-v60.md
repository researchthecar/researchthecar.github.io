The 2020 Volvo V60 is a stylish and practical wagon praised for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and advanced safety features. Engine options include the T5, a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque; the T6, a 2.0-liter turbocharged and supercharged inline-4 producing 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque; and the T8 eAWD plug-in hybrid, which combines the T6 engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 400 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the V60's Scandinavian design and comfortable seats, but some dislike the infotainment system's complexity and the limited cargo space compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**T5 (2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test. Potential fixes range from replacing PCV valve components to piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and required repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**T6 (2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged Inline-4)**

*   **Coolant Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks may occur from the water pump or other connections in the cooling system. This can lead to overheating and potential engine damage. Look for coolant pooling under the vehicle or low coolant level warnings.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. This may involve replacing hoses, clamps, the water pump, or the coolant reservoir.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**T8 eAWD Plug-in Hybrid (2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged Inline-4 + Electric Motor)**

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in the hybrid battery's capacity over time, resulting in reduced all-electric range.
    *   Solution: While some degradation is normal, excessive loss of range may warrant a battery health check at the dealer. In some cases, battery replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+ for battery replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating is also a common complaint.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve some shifting issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $5,000+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system can be slow to respond, glitchy, or prone to freezing. Connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto are also reported.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) rely on various sensors. Malfunctions of these sensors can cause warnings lights, and disable safety features like lane keeping assist, blind spot monitoring, and adaptive cruise control.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is required to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor and recalibration of the system is typically necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ per sensor, including labor and calibration.
