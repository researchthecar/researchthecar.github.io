The 2021 Volvo XC40 Recharge is an all-electric compact SUV marking Volvo's first fully electric vehicle. It features a dual-motor setup producing 402 horsepower and 486 lb-ft of torque. There are no other engine or transmission options available. Owners generally appreciate the XC40 Recharge's brisk acceleration, stylish design, and comfortable interior. Common criticisms include the limited range compared to some competitors, the infotainment system's complexity, and some reports of software glitches.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Motor (402 hp)**
*   **Reduced Battery Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The actual range experienced by some owners falls significantly short of the EPA-estimated 208 miles. Factors such as driving style, weather conditions, and use of climate control can drastically reduce the range.
    *   Solution: No specific mechanical fix. Improved driving habits to extend range, such as limiting aggressive acceleration and using regenerative braking more effectively, and pre-conditioning the cabin while plugged in can help. Volvo has also issued software updates to optimize battery management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Behavioral changes and software updates are involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Decreased Performance with Cold Weather**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In extremely cold temperatures, some owners have reported a noticeable decrease in acceleration and overall performance of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Some vehicles have had success after receiving a software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Software Update)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical System**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Android Automotive OS-based infotainment system can be buggy, leading to issues like slow response times, freezing, crashing, and connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Volvo releases over-the-air (OTA) software updates to address these issues. Sometimes, a hard reset of the system may be necessary. For more severe issues, dealer intervention for software re-flashing might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Typically covered by warranty or software updates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, which powers auxiliary systems, can drain unexpectedly, leading to starting problems or other electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a Volvo technician to identify the parasitic drain. Possible solutions include software updates, replacing faulty modules, or replacing the 12V battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the charging port failing to latch properly, or not releasing the charging cable after a charging session.
    *   Solution: Software updates have been released. If that fails, the charging port itself may need to be inspected and possibly replaced.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2021 Volvo XC40 Recharge faces several common issues, primarily related to its electrical systems and infotainment glitches. These electrical issues can range from minor inconveniences to more significant problems like battery drain, but Volvo has been actively addressing them through software updates. Interior rattles and exterior tailgate malfunctions are also reported. The severity of these issues varies. Costs of repair depend on the source of the issue, ranging from no cost (software updates) to potentially several hundred dollars or more for hardware replacements.
