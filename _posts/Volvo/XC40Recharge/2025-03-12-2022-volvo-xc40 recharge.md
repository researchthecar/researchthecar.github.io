The 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge is a fully electric compact SUV, boasting a dual-motor setup producing 402 horsepower and 486 lb-ft of torque. There are no other engine or transmission options, as it's solely offered as an EV. Owners often praise its peppy acceleration, stylish design, and comfortable interior. Some common criticisms include its limited range compared to some competitors and the sometimes-unintuitive infotainment system.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Motor (402 hp)**

*   **Reduced Battery Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The real-world range of the XC40 Recharge often falls short of the EPA-estimated range, especially in colder weather or when driving at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: There is no true fix, but being mindful of driving habits, pre-conditioning the battery, and keeping tires properly inflated can help maximize range. Volvo has also issued over-the-air software updates to optimize energy management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A - No specific repair. Software updates are typically free.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HV Battery Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported high voltage (HV) battery module failure causing the vehicle to be inoperable. The dashboard warning lights will illuminate, and the vehicle may display a "Propulsion System Service Required" message.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty battery module is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (Likely covered under warranty if within the battery warranty period)

    *   Description/Symptoms: The Android Automotive-based infotainment system can be prone to freezing, crashing, or experiencing glitches. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset (holding the home button), installing software updates when available, or in some cases, requiring dealer intervention for a full system re-flash.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free. A dealer re-flash may incur a labor charge.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, used for auxiliary systems, can drain prematurely, leading to starting issues or failure of electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to identify the parasitic drain source. This could involve replacing the battery, updating software to prevent excessive draw, or repairing faulty modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ depending on the cause and if the battery needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Connectivity Issues (Volvo App)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties connecting to the Volvo app for remote functions such as preconditioning, locking/unlocking, and monitoring battery status.

    *   Solution: Lubricating the sunroof seals and mechanisms, adjusting the sunroof alignment, or, in some cases, replacing worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Reflection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard's design creates a glare/reflection on the windshield in certain lighting conditions.

**Summary**

The 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge presents a mix of issues. Some of the common complaints relate to the infotainment system, battery range, and connectivity. While some issues are relatively minor, such as sunroof noises, others like battery module failure can be quite expensive to repair if not covered by warranty. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls and factor them into their decision-making process, especially regarding long-term ownership costs.
