**2018 Volvo VNL 760**

The 2018 Volvo VNL 760 is a heavy-duty truck powered by a 12.8-liter Cummins X15 engine with 500 horsepower and 1,850 lb-ft of torque paired with an I-Shift AMT transmission. The truck is known for its fuel efficiency, advanced safety features, and comfortable interior. However, there are some issues that owners have reported.

**Engine**

**12.8-liter Cummins X15**

- **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger may fail, leading to reduced engine power and increased exhaust emissions. This issue can be caused by a faulty wastegate actuator or a damaged turbocharger cartridge. The fix involves replacing the turbocharger, which costs around $2,500 - $4,000 including labor.
- **EGR System Malfunction:** The EGR system may malfunction, causing increased NOx emissions and reduced engine performance. This issue can be resolved by cleaning or replacing the EGR valve, which costs around $500 - $1,000 including labor.
- **Fuel Injector Failure:** A faulty fuel injector can lead to rough idling, misfiring, and decreased fuel economy. The fix involves replacing the injector, which costs around $200 - $500 including labor.

**Transmission**

**I-Shift AMT**

- **Transmission Fluid Leak:** The transmission fluid may leak from the transmission case or the torque converter. This issue can be caused by a faulty seal or a damaged transmission housing. The fix involves replacing the seal or the transmission housing, which costs around $1,000 - $2,500 including labor.
- **Gear Shifting Problems:** The transmission may not shift gears smoothly or it may hesitate during gear changes. This issue can be caused by a faulty solenoid or a worn clutch. The fix involves replacing the solenoid or the clutch, which costs around $500 - $1,500 including labor.

**Suspension**

- **Leaf Spring Breakage:** The leaf springs may break, causing the truck to sag or tilt to one side. This issue can be caused by overloading or by driving over rough roads. The fix involves replacing the leaf springs, which costs around $1,500 - $3,000 including labor.
- **Air Bag Leaks:** The air bags used in the suspension may leak, causing the truck to lose height or become unstable. This issue can be caused by a damaged air bag or a faulty air line. The fix involves replacing the air bag or the air line, which costs around $500 - $1,000 including labor.

**Electrical**

- **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail, causing the charging system to malfunction and the battery to discharge. This issue can be caused by a faulty voltage regulator or a damaged wiring harness. The fix involves replacing the alternator, which costs around $500 - $1,000 including labor.
- **Starter Motor Failure:** The starter motor may fail, preventing the truck from starting. This issue can be caused by a faulty solenoid or a worn starter drive. The fix involves replacing the starter motor, which costs around $500 - $1,000 including labor.
- **Battery Drain:** The battery may drain prematurely, causing the truck to be difficult to start. This issue can be caused by a parasitic electrical load or a faulty battery. The fix involves identifying and eliminating the parasitic load or replacing the battery, which costs around $200 - $500.

**Exterior**

- **Hood Hinge Failure:** The hood hinge may fail, causing the hood to fall open while driving. This issue can be caused by a faulty hinge assembly or a damaged hood. The fix involves replacing the hinge assembly or the hood, which costs around $1,000 - $2,500 including labor.
- **Door Seal Leaks:** The door seals may leak, allowing water or dust to enter the cab. This issue can be caused by a damaged seal or a misaligned door. The fix involves replacing the seal or adjusting the door, which costs around $200 - $500 including labor.

**Interior**

- **Instrument Panel Failure:** The instrument panel may fail, causing the speedometer, tachometer, and other gauges to stop working. This issue can be caused by a faulty circuit board or a damaged wire harness. The fix involves replacing the instrument panel, which costs around $1,000 - $2,000 including labor.
- **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may malfunction, causing the temperature or airflow to not work properly. This issue can be caused by a faulty sensor or a damaged actuator. The fix involves replacing the sensor or the actuator, which costs around $500 - $1,000 including labor.
- **Seat Adjustment Failure:** The seat adjustment may fail, preventing the driver from adjusting the seat to a comfortable position. This issue can be caused by a faulty switch or a damaged cable. The fix involves replacing the switch or the cable, which costs around $200 - $500 including labor.

**Summary**

Overall, the 2018 Volvo VNL 760 is a reliable and capable heavy-duty truck. However, it has some reported issues that owners should be aware of. The most severe issues include turbocharger failure, transmission fluid leaks, and instrument panel failure, which can be costly to fix. Other issues, such as door seal leaks and seat adjustment failure, are less severe and less expensive to fix.
