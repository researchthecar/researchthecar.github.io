The 2000 Volvo S70 is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues related to aging components. The most common problems involve the engine (particularly turbocharger failures and oil leaks), transmission (slipping and harsh shifting), and electrical systems (ABS module failure). Suspension components, like struts, shocks, and control arm bushings, also tend to wear out with age and mileage. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as turbocharger replacement or transmission overhaul, can be costly. Addressing these issues promptly will help maintain the S70's reliability and extend its lifespan.
