### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Volvo S70 offers a blend of safety and comfort, but like many vehicles of its era, it is not without potential issues. Common problems tend to revolve around the PCV system, ignition coils, and automatic transmission solenoids. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and ABS module, can also arise. Suspension components like strut mounts and bushings are also areas to inspect. While not overwhelmingly problematic, owners should be prepared for potential repairs, especially concerning the engine and transmission, which are the most frequent sources of significant repair costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate these issues and ensure continued reliability.
