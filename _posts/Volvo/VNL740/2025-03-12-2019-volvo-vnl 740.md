**Summary**

The 2019 Volvo VNL 740, while generally reliable, can experience issues related to its complex emissions systems, particularly the DPF and EGR valve. Transmission problems with the I-Shift, especially shifting and clutch issues, are also common. Electrical issues stemming from sensor failures and wiring harnesses can occur. While the severity of these issues varies, the cost of repair can be significant, especially for major components like the DPF, EGR valve, and transmission. Regular maintenance and addressing issues promptly can help mitigate these problems.
