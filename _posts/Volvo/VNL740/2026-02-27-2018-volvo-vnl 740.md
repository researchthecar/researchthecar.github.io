### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Volvo VNL 740 demonstrates a generally strong reliability record, particularly with its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The most frequently cited technical issues tend to revolve around the EGR system and DPF regeneration on the D13 engines, and potential electronic control module or actuator problems with the I-Shift transmission. Electrical system issues, while not widespread, can occur due to wiring harness wear. The suspension's air components are susceptible to leaks over time. Overall, the VNL 740 is a dependable truck, but fleet operators should be aware of these specific potential failure points and budget accordingly for repairs, especially concerning emissions systems and automated transmissions.
