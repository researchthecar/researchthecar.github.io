### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volvo VNL 740 demonstrates strong reliability, particularly with its robust engine and transmission options. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to be related to emissions systems (like EGR coolers and DPFs) on the D11 and D13 engines, and occasional electronic control module or actuator problems with the I-Shift transmission. Suspension components, especially air springs, can develop leaks over time, which is typical for this type of system. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from wiring harness wear, are also a possibility in heavy-duty applications. Overall, the VNL 740 is a dependable choice, with most issues being addressable and not indicative of systemic design flaws. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are key to maximizing its lifespan and minimizing downtime.
