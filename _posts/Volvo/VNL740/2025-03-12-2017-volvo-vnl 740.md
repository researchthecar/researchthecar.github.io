The 2017 Volvo VNL 740 is a popular Class 8 semi-truck known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable cab, and overall reliability. The VNL 740 was offered with several engine options, including the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins ISX15 (depending on market availability and model year). The Volvo D13 engine, for example, produces between 405 and 500 horsepower and between 1450 and 1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Transmission options typically include the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission, as well as manual transmissions from Eaton Fuller. Owners generally appreciate the VNL 740's comfortable ride and fuel economy, but some dislike the complexity of the Volvo proprietary systems and the higher cost of Volvo-specific parts.
