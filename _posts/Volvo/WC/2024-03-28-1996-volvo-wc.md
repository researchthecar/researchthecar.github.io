## 1996 Volvo WC

The 1996 Volvo WC was a full-size luxury sedan that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 2.5-liter inline-6 that produced 170 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 2.9-liter inline-6 that produced 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The WC was a well-equipped car for its time, with standard features such as leather seats, power windows, and a sunroof. It also received high marks for its safety features, which included dual airbags and anti-lock brakes.

However, the WC was not without its problems. Some owners reported experiencing issues with the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, exterior, and interior.
