The 2022 Volvo VNR is a regional day cab designed for vocational applications. It's a popular choice for its maneuverability and driver comfort. What people like is that it is built to be a very versatile truck for many different types of applications. What people may dislike is that it is built for short-range applications, so some of the premium interior and luxury features of long-haul trucks are missing. The VNR is available with the Volvo D11 engine producing between 325 and 425 horsepower and 1250 to 1650 lb-ft of torque. It is also available with the D13 engine. Transmission options include the Volvo I-Shift.
