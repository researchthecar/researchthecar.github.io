### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Volvo VNR demonstrates a solid reliability record, particularly in its core powertrain and structural components. The most frequently cited technical issues revolve around the Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) system, common across many modern diesel trucks, and specific components within the automated I-Shift transmission. While the D11, D13, and D16 engines are generally robust, DEF system malfunctions can lead to significant downtime and repair costs. The I-Shift transmission, while offering efficiency, can experience issues with its clutch actuators and control modules. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components show good reliability, with only isolated reports of minor issues such as air spring leaks or HVAC blower motor failures. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights, especially those related to the emissions system, are crucial for maximizing the longevity and minimizing unexpected costs of the 2021 Volvo VNR.
