The 2019 Volvo VNR is a regional haul tractor designed for efficiency and driver comfort. The VNR series is known for its aerodynamic design and fuel-efficient operation. The most common engine option is the Volvo D13 engine, producing between 375-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available include the Volvo D11 and Cummins X12. Transmission options are typically Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmissions or Eaton manual transmissions. Drivers often praise the VNR for its comfortable cab and smooth ride, while some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the aftertreatment system and occasional electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine overheating. Can lead to reduced engine performance and increased fuel consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, and the DPF light illuminating on the dashboard. Can lead to engine derate and ultimately require replacement of the DPF.
    *   Solution: DPF cleaning or replacement. In some cases, issues with the aftertreatment system leading to excessive soot production may need to be addressed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on cleaning vs. replacement and if other aftertreatment components need attention
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Cummins X12**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (per injector)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift**

*   **Shift Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delays in shifting, especially between certain gears, and harsh or jerky gear changes.
    *   Solution: Software updates, clutch adjustment, or replacement of the transmission control module (TCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+ depending on the needed repairs
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, and unusual noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Eaton Manual Transmission**

*   **Hard Shifting/Gear Grinding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting between gears, especially when cold, and grinding noises during gear changes. Often linked to worn synchronizers or clutch issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission overhaul or replacement of worn parts like synchronizers, bearings, and potentially the clutch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether a rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The truck leaning to one side, difficulty maintaining ride height, and the sound of air leaking from the suspension components.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of air bags, air lines, leveling valves, or air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the part and labor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (NOx, Temperature, Pressure)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fault codes related to emissions systems, engine performance, or aftertreatment.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, including labor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, warning lights illuminating, or starting problems. Often caused by corrosion or damage to the wiring harness.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of damaged wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and location of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Volvo VNR is a generally reliable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly those related to the emissions system (DPF, EGR) and electrical components. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more costly repairs. Depending on the issue, repairs can be quite costly and can have varying severity. Preventative maintenance, particularly regarding the aftertreatment system, is crucial to minimize potential problems.
