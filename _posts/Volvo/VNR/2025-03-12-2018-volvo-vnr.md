The 2018 Volvo VNR is a regional day cab tractor designed for local and regional deliveries. Engine options include the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins X15. The Volvo D13 engine produces between 405 and 500 horsepower and between 1450 and 1850 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options predominantly involve Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission, though manual options were available. Owners often praise the VNR for its maneuverability, driver comfort, and fuel efficiency. Common dislikes include certain aspects of the automated transmission's shift logic, and the cost of replacement parts and service.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, white smoke from exhaust, potential engine overheating. The EGR cooler can crack or rupture, allowing coolant to enter the exhaust stream.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from exhaust. Fuel injectors can become clogged or fail.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Cummins X15**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, reduced power, fault codes related to DPF clogging. The DPF can become overloaded with soot, especially in applications with frequent idling or low-speed operation.
    *   Solution: DPF cleaning or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, unusual noises from the turbocharger, potential oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Shift Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, failure to shift, error codes related to shift actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty shift actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Clutch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slipping, difficulty engaging gears, unusual noises during shifting. Premature clutch wear can occur, particularly in stop-and-go applications.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, uneven ride height, air leaks, ride quality issues. Air springs can develop leaks or rupture over time.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty air springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per air spring
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll. Shock absorbers can lose their damping ability over time.
    *   Solution: Replace worn shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per shock absorber
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, various performance issues depending on the affected sensor (e.g., speed sensor, temperature sensor).
    *   Solution: Replace faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, short circuits, difficulty starting, gauge malfunctions. Wiring harnesses can experience corrosion or damage, leading to electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace damaged wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the damage
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside headlight lenses, reduced visibility.
    *   Solution: Replace or reseal headlight assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per headlight
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced heating or cooling performance, blower motor failure, unusual noises from the HVAC system.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace faulty HVAC components (e.g., blower motor, compressor, blend door actuator).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Volvo VNR experiences common issues related to its engine (particularly EGR and fuel systems in the D13 and DPF/Turbo in the Cummins), transmission (I-Shift shift actuators and clutch), suspension, and electrical components. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Some problems like sensor malfunctions are relatively inexpensive to fix, while others like EGR cooler failure, turbocharger failure, or transmission repairs can be significantly more costly.
