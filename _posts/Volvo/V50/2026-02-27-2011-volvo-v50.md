### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Volvo V50 is a generally dependable vehicle with a good safety record. The naturally aspirated 2.4L engine and manual transmission variants tend to be the most trouble-free. The turbocharged 2.5L engine, while offering more performance, is more prone to issues like PCV system failures and turbocharger problems. Automatic transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, are also a notable concern for some owners. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the CEM module, can cause frustrating intermittent problems. Overall, with proper maintenance and attention to potential weak points, the V50 can provide reliable service, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine and transmission combinations and their associated reliability trends.
