The 2007 Volvo V50 is a compact wagon known for its safety, Scandinavian design, and practicality. Engine options for the 2007 model year included a 2.4i inline-5 producing 168 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and the turbocharged T5 inline-5 generating 218 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (T5 only), and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the V50's comfortable ride, spacious cargo area for its class, and distinctive styling. Common complaints often revolve around relatively high running costs, some reliability concerns with certain components, and limited rear passenger legroom compared to larger wagons.

**Summary**

The 2007 Volvo V50 is a stylish and practical wagon that can provide years of reliable service, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly turbocharger failures on the T5 and EVAP issues on the 2.4i, can be costly. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, are also a concern. Electrical problems, often related to the CEM, can be difficult to diagnose. Suspension wear and rust are typical for a vehicle of this age. Overall, while the V50 offers a unique blend of style and utility, potential buyers should factor in the possibility of needing to address some of these common issues, which can range from minor repairs costing under $100 to more significant repairs exceeding $1,000. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
