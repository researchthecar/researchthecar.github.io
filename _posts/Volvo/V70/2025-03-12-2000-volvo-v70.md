The 2000 Volvo V70 is a versatile wagon known for its safety, comfort, and practicality. Engine options included a range of inline-5 cylinder engines, naturally aspirated and turbocharged. The most common engines were the 2.4L inline-5 (around 168 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque) and the 2.3L turbocharged inline-5 (around 236 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (AW50-42). People generally appreciate the V70's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and Volvo's reputation for safety. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated styling, potential for electrical gremlins, and the cost of maintaining a European car of this age.
