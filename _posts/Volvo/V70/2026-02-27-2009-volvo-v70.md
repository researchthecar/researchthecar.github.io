### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volvo V70 is a solid choice for a family wagon, offering a good blend of comfort, safety, and practicality. While generally reliable, potential buyers should be aware of specific issues that can arise, particularly with the turbocharged gasoline engines (PCV system, turbocharger) and the automatic transmission (solenoid pack, torque converter). Diesel models may encounter DPF or EGR problems. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the CEM module, can also occur. The optional Four-C suspension, while enhancing driving dynamics, can be costly to repair if the adaptive dampers fail. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to ensuring long-term dependability.
