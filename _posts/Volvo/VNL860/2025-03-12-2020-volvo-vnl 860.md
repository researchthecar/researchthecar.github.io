The 2020 Volvo VNL 860 is a popular long-haul semi-truck known for its comfortable cabin, fuel efficiency, and safety features. Common engine options include the Volvo D11, D13, and D16. The D13, a 12.8-liter inline-six diesel engine, is among the most popular choices, offering horsepower ratings from 405 to 500 and torque ranging from 1450 to 1850 lb-ft. People often praise the VNL 860 for its spacious sleeper cab, smooth ride, and Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Some common complaints include the complexity of the emissions systems, potential for electrical issues, and the higher cost of Volvo-specific parts and maintenance.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive coolant consumption without external leaks, white smoke from the exhaust, engine overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler is necessary. Inspect related components like the EGR valve and cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regenerations, reduced engine power, DPF warning lights illuminated, and eventual engine shutdown if the DPF becomes excessively clogged.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration, cleaning, or replacement, depending on the severity of the clogging. Check for underlying issues causing excessive soot production, like faulty injectors or turbocharger problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning not cooling properly, heater not producing sufficient heat, inconsistent temperature control, blower motor malfunctions, and refrigerant leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the HVAC system to identify the root cause. Potential solutions include refrigerant recharge, replacement of faulty components (e.g., compressor, condenser, evaporator, blower motor), and repair of vacuum lines and controls.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Volvo VNL 860 is generally a reliable truck, but owners may experience issues with the EGR cooler, DPF system, and air suspension. Electrical problems, sensor failures, and wiring harness issues can also occur. Transmission problems may also be a problem. Interior HVAC problems round out the list of common issues. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission work, can be significantly more costly. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to maintaining the truck's reliability and minimizing downtime.
