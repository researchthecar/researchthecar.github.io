**Introduction to the 2017 Volvo VNL 860**

The 2017 Volvo VNL 860 is a powerful and efficient semi-truck that has been praised for its comfort, fuel efficiency, and safety features. It is available with a variety of engine and transmission options, allowing buyers to customize it to their specific needs. The D13 engine is a popular choice for its high horsepower and torque, while the I-Shift transmission provides smooth and efficient gear changes.

**Engine**

* **D13 Engine (500 HP, 1850 lb-ft)**
    * **Fuel Injector Failure:** Premature wear can lead to poor fuel delivery, reduced power, and increased emissions. Replacing injectors can cost $1000 - $2000+ per injector.
    * **Turbocharger Boost Leak:** A leak in the turbocharged system can reduce boost pressure, resulting in decreased power and fuel efficiency. Repairing the leak can cost $500 - $1500+.
* **D13 Engine (455 HP, 1650 lb-ft)**
    * **EGR Cooler Failure:** The EGR cooler can develop leaks or become clogged, causing reduced engine power and increased emissions. Replacing the EGR cooler can cost $1500 - $3000+.
* **D13 Engine (430 HP, 1550 lb-ft)**
    * **Intake Manifold Failure:** The intake manifold can develop cracks or leaks, causing reduced airflow and engine performance. Replacing the intake manifold can cost $1000 - $2500+.

**Transmission**

* **I-Shift Transmission (12-Speed)**
    * **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** The mechatronic unit is responsible for controlling gear changes and shifting. Its failure can cause the transmission to malfunction or become stuck in gear. Replacing the mechatronic unit can cost $5000 - $7000+.
* **I-Shift Transmission (10-Speed)**
    * **Software Glitch:** The transmission control software can occasionally experience glitches, causing erratic shifting or delayed gear changes. Updating the software can resolve the issue for free.
* **Manual Transmission (13-Speed)**
    * **Clutch Failure:** The clutch can wear out prematurely, causing difficulty shifting gears or a loss of power. Replacing the clutch can cost $2000 - $4000+.
