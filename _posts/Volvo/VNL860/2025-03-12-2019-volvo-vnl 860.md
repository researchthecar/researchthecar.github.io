The 2019 Volvo VNL 860 is a popular long-haul semi-truck known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable cab, and advanced safety features. Engine options include the Volvo D11, D13, and Cummins X15. The Volvo D13 engine, a common choice, produces between 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options primarily include the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission. Drivers often praise the VNL 860 for its smooth ride and spacious interior, while some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the electronics and the cost of repairs.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, frequent regeneration cycles, and dashboard warning lights indicating a clogged DPF.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF, cleaning the DPF, or replacement of the DPF if cleaning is not successful.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on cleaning vs. replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel efficiency, black smoke from the exhaust, and engine fault codes related to the EGR valve.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Cummins X15**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, decreased power, and potentially black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the faulty injector(s) and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift (Automated Manual Transmission)**

*   **Shift Hesitation/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delays in shifting gears, especially during acceleration or uphill climbs. The transmission may also exhibit jerky or inconsistent shifting behavior.
    *   Solution: Software update of the Transmission Control Module (TCM), calibration of the transmission, or in some cases, replacement of the shift actuators or solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on the cause and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, and unusual noises coming from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Truck leaning to one side, ride height issues, hissing sounds from the suspension components, and failure of the air compressor to maintain pressure.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of leaking air bags, air lines, or leveling valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A variety of warning lights on the dashboard, inaccurate readings from gauges, and potential performance issues related to the affected system (e.g., ABS, engine). Common culprits include wheel speed sensors, coolant temperature sensors, and pressure sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty sensor and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, gauges not working correctly, or warning lights appearing and disappearing. Often caused by chafed or damaged wiring harnesses, particularly in areas exposed to vibration or the elements.
    *   Solution: Inspection and repair of the wiring harness, including replacing damaged wires and connectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inadequate heating or cooling, uneven airflow, or unusual noises from the HVAC system. Common issues include failure of the blower motor, blend door actuator problems, and refrigerant leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific problem and repair or replacement of the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Volvo VNL 860, while generally reliable, does experience certain issues. DPF clogging, EGR valve failure, and I-Shift transmission problems appear to be the most prevalent and costly. Electrical issues and air suspension leaks also contribute to the common complaints. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to resolve, others can lead to significant repair bills, making preventative maintenance and careful monitoring crucial for VNL 860 owners. The severity of the issues range from minor inconveniences to potentially truck-stopping problems.
