The 2017 Volvo VNL 860, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues. Engine-related problems, especially with the DPF and EGR system of the Volvo D13 or the turbocharger and injectors of the Cummins ISX15, can be costly. Transmission issues, such as slipping, with the I-Shift can also lead to significant repair bills. Electrical and suspension issues are less severe in terms of cost, but can still impact the overall ownership experience. It's worth noting that the Volvo I-Shift can be an expensive fix when it experiences slipping. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the possibility of higher maintenance costs when considering the purchase of a used 2017 Volvo VNL 860.
