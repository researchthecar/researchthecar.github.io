**Introduction:**

The 2020 Volvo 9800 is a heavy-duty, luxury coach bus that comes equipped with a D13TC engine, which produces 500 horsepower and 1,850 lb-ft of torque. The 9800's transmission options include an I-Shift 12-speed automated manual transmission and an Allison B500 6-speed automatic transmission.
