The 2018 Volvo V90 is a luxury wagon praised for its elegant design, comfortable interior, and a range of powerful and efficient engines. Available engine options included the T5, T6, and T8 powertrains. The T5 is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing around 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The T6 adds a supercharger to the 2.0-liter inline-4, boosting output to approximately 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The T8 is a plug-in hybrid, combining the supercharged and turbocharged 2.0-liter engine with an electric motor, delivering a total system output of around 400 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque. Most models came with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the V90's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and advanced safety features.
