The 2018 Volvo ProCity bus is a low-floor city bus designed for efficient and comfortable urban transportation. Information regarding specific engine options and performance data (horsepower, torque) and common issues is limited due to the specialized and commercial nature of the vehicle. These buses are typically powered by diesel engines, and potentially hybrid powertrains, but specific engine types would vary depending on market and operator specifications. Owners tend to praise their accessibility, fuel efficiency (relative to other buses), and reliability in demanding stop-start city environments. Dissatisfaction may arise from maintenance costs inherent to commercial vehicles, the complexity of the vehicle's systems, and the availability of specialized parts and service.

**Electric Motor**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The bus may lean to one side, ride quality diminishes significantly, and the air compressor may run continuously. This is often due to leaks in the air springs or malfunctioning height sensors.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty air springs or height sensors and repairing any leaks in the air lines.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the components needing replacement and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Multiplexing System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Problems with the multiplexing system can manifest as seemingly random electrical malfunctions. These can include lights flickering, doors malfunctioning, or issues with the driver information display.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the specific issue using diagnostic tools and potentially replacing faulty control modules or repairing wiring harnesses.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the complexity of the issue and the parts needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CAN Bus Communication Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failure of communication between the various onboard computers. Symptoms can include fault codes, inoperable systems, and intermittent failures.
    * Solution: Requires specialized diagnostic tools to identify the faulty node on the CAN bus, repair damaged wiring, or replace a faulty module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $2000+ depending on the complexity of the fault and the parts required.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Door Mechanism Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: The automatic doors can experience failures, including sticking, failing to open or close properly, or exhibiting unusual noises during operation. This is often due to worn rollers, damaged sensors, or problems with the pneumatic or electric actuators.
    * Solution: Replacing worn or damaged components such as rollers, sensors, or actuators. Adjusting and lubricating the door mechanisms.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per door depending on the severity of the issue and the components needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, leading to inconsistent temperature control or complete failure. This can be caused by refrigerant leaks, compressor failures, or problems with the blower motors or control units.
    * Solution: Repairing refrigerant leaks, replacing faulty compressors or blower motors, or recalibrating the control units.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+ depending on the components needing replacement and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

While the 2018 Volvo ProCity is known for its accessibility and efficiency, some common issues include air suspension failures, multiplexing system glitches, CAN bus communication problems, door mechanism malfunctions, and HVAC system malfunctions. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the parts needed, ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand for more complex problems. Due to the vehicle's commercial application, maintenance tends to be more involved and costly than that of a passenger vehicle.
