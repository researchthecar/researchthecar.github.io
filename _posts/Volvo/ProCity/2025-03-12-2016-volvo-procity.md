The 2016 Volvo ProCity, a city bus designed for efficient and comfortable urban transportation, came with a variety of configurations tailored to different city needs. While specific engine options may vary by region and operator, it is generally configured with a diesel engine ranging from 7 liters to 12 liters, focusing on fuel efficiency and reduced emissions and an automatic transmission. These diesel engines typically produce horsepower from 250 to 400 and torque figures ranging from 800 lb-ft to 1400 lb-ft. Operators often praise the ProCity for its durability, passenger capacity, and accessibility features. Some common dislikes include maintenance complexity and potentially higher operating costs.

**Summary**

The 2016 Volvo ProCity can experience a range of issues, from engine and transmission problems related to specific configurations to more general electrical and suspension concerns. Engine and transmission repairs, particularly those involving turbochargers, torque converters, or complete overhauls, can be quite expensive. Electrical issues related to the multiplexing system can also be costly to diagnose and repair due to their complexity. Suspension and exterior issues, such as air suspension and door actuator failures, contribute to the overall maintenance burden. While the ProCity is known for its durability and passenger capacity, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for costly repairs, especially related to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems.
