The 2021 Volvo ProCity is a city bus designed for efficient and environmentally conscious public transportation. Information about specific engine options, horsepower/torque, and owner sentiment (likes/dislikes) is not publicly available for this specialized commercial vehicle in the same way as consumer cars. It is designed for city transit. There are limited public reviews available. However, it is likely offered with a range of diesel, CNG, and/or hybrid powertrains, depending on local market regulations and customer specifications. Common concerns for city buses often relate to reliability, fuel economy (or energy efficiency for electric/hybrid models), passenger comfort, and ease of maintenance.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor Option**
* **Reduced Range in Cold Weather**
    * Description/Symptoms: The range of the electric bus is noticeably reduced in cold weather due to battery performance degradation at lower temperatures.
    * Solution: Preheat the battery before operation or implement more efficient heating systems within the bus to maintain battery temperature.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the solution, could range from software updates to auxiliary heating system upgrades, not including labor.

* **Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the battery capacity degrades, reducing the overall range and performance of the bus.
    * Solution: Battery replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement can be extremely costly, easily exceeding $50,000 depending on battery size and supplier contracts.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**
