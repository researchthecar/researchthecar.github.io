### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volvo ProCity demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and chassis components. The most frequently cited issues tend to be related to emissions systems (DPF, EGR) on the diesel engines and potential wear on suspension parts over time, which is common for commercial vehicles. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, can occur but are not pervasive. With proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly, the ProCity is expected to provide dependable service for its intended operational lifespan.
