The 2022 Volvo XC40 is a popular subcompact luxury SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and a range of safety features. Available powertrains include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, offered in both front-wheel drive (T4) and all-wheel drive (T5) configurations, and a fully electric powertrain (Recharge). The T5 engine produces 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A common point of praise is the XC40's upscale interior and nimble handling, while some criticisms focus on the infotainment system's complexity and occasionally hesitant acceleration with the base T4 engine.
