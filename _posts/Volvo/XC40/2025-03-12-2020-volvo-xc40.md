The 2020 Volvo XC40 is a popular subcompact luxury SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and impressive safety features. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, available in two different tunes: the T4, producing 187 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, and the T5, which delivers 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an Aisin-Warner 8-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the XC40's upscale interior and modern technology, some common complaints have surfaced regarding the infotainment system, electrical glitches, and occasional engine-related issues. Some find the ride a bit stiff for a luxury vehicle and the rear seat space somewhat limited.
