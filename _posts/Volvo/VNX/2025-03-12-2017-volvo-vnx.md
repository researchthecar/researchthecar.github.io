The 2017 Volvo VNX is a heavy-duty truck designed for vocational applications such as heavy hauling and construction. Engine options for the 2017 VNX included the Volvo D11, D13, and D16 engines, offering a range of horsepower and torque outputs. For example, the D13 engine could produce between 405-500 horsepower and 1450-1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific configuration. Available transmissions were primarily Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the VNX for its comfortable cab, robust build quality, and fuel efficiency. Common dislikes include the higher cost of Volvo parts and the specialized knowledge required for some repairs.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, reduced power, poor fuel economy, and potential for black smoke from the exhaust. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel injector performance are often present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). Proper diagnosis is crucial to identify the specific injector(s) causing the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential for overheating. The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) cooler can crack or leak internally, leading to these symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty EGR cooler. It is often recommended to inspect and clean the EGR valve as well during this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Volvo D16**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and a whistling or screeching noise from the turbocharger. Turbocharger failure can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger. It's important to diagnose the root cause of the failure to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift**

*   **Shift Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, erratic shifting behavior, or the transmission getting stuck in a gear. The shift actuator is responsible for selecting gears in the I-Shift transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty shift actuator. Calibration of the transmission after replacement is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, or a chattering noise from the transmission. Heavy use and improper driving habits can contribute to premature clutch wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch assembly, including the clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Component Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaning to one side, rough ride, and the air suspension system failing to maintain proper ride height. Air bags, height control valves, and air compressors are common failure points in air suspension systems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air suspension component(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EBS (Electronic Braking System) Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard, reduced braking performance, and potential for ABS or stability control malfunctions. Wheel speed sensors and other EBS sensors can fail due to road debris, corrosion, or electrical damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty EBS sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Multiplexing/Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights not working, gauges malfunctioning, or difficulty starting the engine. Corrosion, chafing, and loose connections can cause these issues in the complex wiring harnesses.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the faulty wiring harness or connectors. This can involve tracing wires, repairing connections, and replacing damaged sections of the harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight/Taillight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight or taillight assemblies, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs.
    *   Solution: Removal of the moisture, resealing of the light assembly, or replacement of the entire unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent temperature control, with air blowing hot or cold regardless of the setting. The blend door actuator controls the mixing of hot and cold air in the HVAC system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Volvo VNX can experience a range of issues, with engine and transmission problems being the most costly and potentially impacting performance. Electrical issues, while sometimes minor, can be challenging to diagnose. Suspension and interior issues are typically less expensive to resolve. While the VNX is known for its durability, these potential problems should be considered when evaluating a used model.
