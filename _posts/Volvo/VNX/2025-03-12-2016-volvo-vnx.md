The 2016 Volvo VNX is a heavy-duty truck primarily used for vocational applications such as heavy hauling, construction, and logging. Engine options for the 2016 VNX include the Volvo D13 engine, known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. The D13 produces around 500 horsepower and 1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Transmissions are typically Volvo's I-Shift automated manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the VNX for its robust build, comfortable cab, and Volvo's reputation for safety. Common dislikes often include the higher initial cost and the complexity of some of the electronic systems.

**Engine**

**Volvo D13**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, white smoke from exhaust, engine overheating, reduced engine performance. The EGR cooler is prone to cracking and leaking internally.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler. Ensure the new cooler is an updated design to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, frequent DPF regeneration cycles, and a warning light on the dashboard. This is often exacerbated by short trips and infrequent high-speed driving.
    *   Solution: Force a DPF regeneration, clean the DPF, or replace the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Cleaning: $300 - $800; Replacement: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (per injector)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Volvo I-Shift**

*   **Shift Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, inability to shift gears, error codes related to the transmission, and potential transmission lockup.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty engaging gears, unusual noises from the transmission, and a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch assembly, including the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission stuck in gear, failure to shift, and error codes related to the TCM.
    *   Solution: Replace or reprogram the TCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Truck leaning to one side, inability to adjust ride height, air leaks from the suspension components, and a faulty air compressor.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace leaking air bags, air lines, or the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Leaf Springs or Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, rough ride, clunking noises from the suspension, and visible wear or damage to the leaf springs or bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace worn leaf springs or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, malfunctioning lights, sensors not reading correctly, and difficulty starting the engine. Corrosion and chafing of wiring harnesses are common in heavy-duty applications.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace damaged sections of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty readings from various sensors (e.g., temperature sensors, pressure sensors), leading to engine performance issues, warning lights, and diagnostic trouble codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation/Fogging**

**Summary**

The 2016 Volvo VNX, while generally reliable, can experience issues related to its engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. D13 engine EGR cooler and DPF clogging are some common problems. The I-Shift transmission can have issues related to the shift actuator and TCM. The air suspension and electrical system are also prone to issues. The cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the component and the extent of the damage, ranging from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand for major engine or transmission repairs. Owners should be diligent with maintenance and address any issues promptly to prevent further damage.
