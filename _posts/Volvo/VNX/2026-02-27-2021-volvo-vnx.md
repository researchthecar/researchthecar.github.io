### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Volvo VNX demonstrates strong reliability, particularly in its core powertrain components (engines and transmissions), where no widespread issues are reported. The heavy-duty nature of the truck means that while individual component failures can occur, especially under extreme vocational use, systemic problems are rare. Potential areas for attention include the optional air suspension, where leaks can develop, and electrical connections that may be susceptible to corrosion in harsh environments. The interior HVAC system's blower motor is a minor concern. Overall, the VNX is a robust and dependable choice for demanding applications when properly maintained.
