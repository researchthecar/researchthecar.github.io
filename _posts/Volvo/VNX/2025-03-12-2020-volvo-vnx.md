The 2020 Volvo VNX is a heavy-duty truck designed for vocational applications like heavy hauling and construction. The VNX typically features a Volvo D13 engine, a 12.8-liter inline-six diesel engine producing between 405 and 500 horsepower and between 1450 and 1850 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific configuration. Transmission options include the Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the VNX for its robust build, comfortable cab, and Volvo's reputation for safety. Common dislikes can include the higher price point compared to some competitors and occasional issues with the complex electronic systems.

**Summary**

The 2020 Volvo VNX, while generally a reliable truck, can experience issues related to its complex engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Issues with the EGR cooler and fuel injectors in the D13 engine, as well as shifting problems in the I-Shift transmission, are among the more costly and potentially disruptive problems owners may face. Electrical sensor and wiring harness issues are also potential sources of trouble. While the VNX boasts a robust design, addressing these specific problems can require significant investment.
