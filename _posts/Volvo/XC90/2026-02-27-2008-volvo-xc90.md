### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Volvo XC90 offers a blend of safety and utility, but potential buyers should be aware of common reliability concerns. The inline-6 and V8 engines can experience issues like PCV system failures and timing chain wear, respectively. Automatic transmissions, particularly the earlier AW-55 series, are prone to solenoid pack and torque converter problems. Suspension components such as control arm bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the CEM module, and interior issues like clogged sunroof drains are also noted. While many of these issues are repairable, they represent potential costs to consider when purchasing or maintaining this vehicle.
