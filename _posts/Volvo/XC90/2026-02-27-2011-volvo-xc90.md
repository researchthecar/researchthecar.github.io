### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Volvo XC90 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly in its core mechanical components. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the PCV system and oil leaks on the V6 engines, and timing chain concerns on the V8. Transmission issues, while not universal, can manifest as harsh shifting, often addressable with proper maintenance. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and sensor failures, are also noted. Proactive maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission and regular checks for leaks, can significantly mitigate these potential problems. Overall, the XC90 remains a safe and capable SUV, but awareness of these specific technical points is advisable.
