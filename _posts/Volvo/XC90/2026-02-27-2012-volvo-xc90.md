### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Volvo XC90 presents a generally reliable platform, particularly for its era, with its robust engines and sturdy construction. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil leaks and PCV system problems with the 3.2L engine, and timing chain concerns with the V8. Transmission issues like harsh shifting can arise and may require significant repair. Electrical gremlins, especially concerning window regulators and various sensors, are also noted. While exterior components are typically durable, interior issues like clogged sunroof drains can lead to water damage. Proactive maintenance, especially fluid changes and regular inspections, is key to mitigating these potential problems and ensuring the longevity of the XC90.
