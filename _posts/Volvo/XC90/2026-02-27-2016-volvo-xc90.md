### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volvo XC90 is a well-built luxury SUV with a generally strong reliability record. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to be related to the advanced powertrain options, particularly coolant leaks in the 2.0L engines and potential issues with the turbocharger/supercharger on the T6 variant. Diesel models may encounter DPF regeneration problems. The transmission is robust, though some owners report occasional shifting anomalies. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the Sensus infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Optional air suspension systems can be a source of repair costs if leaks develop. Overall, the XC90 offers a premium experience, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific technical areas and factor in potential repair costs, especially for vehicles outside of warranty.
