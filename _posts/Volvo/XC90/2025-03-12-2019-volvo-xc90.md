The 2019 Volvo XC90 is a luxury SUV praised for its elegant design, comfortable ride, and advanced safety features. However, like any vehicle, it has been subject to some owner complaints. The 2019 model year offered a range of engine options including the T5, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque; the T6, a 2.0L turbocharged and supercharged inline-4 producing 316 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque; and the T8 eAWD plug-in hybrid, which combines the T6 engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 400 hp and 472 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with an Aisin Warner 8-speed automatic transmission. Common likes include its spacious interior, luxurious appointments, and distinctive styling. Dislikes often center around the sometimes-complex infotainment system and potential reliability concerns.
