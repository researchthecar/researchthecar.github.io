### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Volvo XC90 generally demonstrates good reliability, particularly with the T5 engine and standard transmission. The T6 and T8 powertrains, while offering more performance and efficiency respectively, have a slightly higher potential for specific issues like coolant leaks and turbocharger problems (T6) or hybrid battery concerns (T8). Optional air suspension can also be a source of repair costs if leaks develop. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system's software, are not uncommon but often resolvable with updates. Overall, the XC90 is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas, especially when considering higher-mileage used examples or the plug-in hybrid variant.
