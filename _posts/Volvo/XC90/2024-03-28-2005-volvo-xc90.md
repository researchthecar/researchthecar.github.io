**Introduction**

The 2005 Volvo XC90 is a mid-size luxury SUV that offers a comfortable and spacious interior, a powerful engine, and a variety of safety features. Engine options include a 2.5-liter inline-5 with 210 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, a 2.9-liter inline-6 with 268 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.4-liter V8 with 311 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed automatic for the inline-5 and inline-6 engines, and a 6-speed automatic for the V8 engine.

Some owners appreciate the XC90's stylish design, comfortable seats, and powerful engines. However, they also complain about its high fuel consumption, poor reliability, and expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**2.5-liter Inline-5**

* **Oil leaks:** The valve cover gasket or rear main seal may fail, causing oil leaks. Symptoms include decreased oil levels and an oily residue under the vehicle. The valve cover gasket can be replaced for $200-$400, while the rear main seal replacement costs around $600-$800.
* **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt may fail prematurely, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a loud rattling noise, engine misfires, and loss of power. Timing belt replacement, including the water pump, typically costs around $1,000-$1,500.
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket may fail, causing vacuum leaks and poor engine performance. Symptoms include a rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, and increased emissions. Replacing the intake manifold gasket costs around $200-$300.

**2.9-liter Inline-6**

* **Intake camshaft sensor failure:** The intake camshaft sensor may fail, causing the engine to run rough, misfire, or stall. Symptoms include a check engine light, poor fuel economy, and rough idle. Replacing the intake camshaft sensor costs around $100-$200.
* **Exhaust manifold warping:** The exhaust manifold may warp, causing exhaust leaks and reduced engine performance. Symptoms include a loud exhaust noise, decreased power, and poor fuel economy. Replacing the exhaust manifold costs around $400-$600.
* **EGR valve failure:** The EGR valve may fail, causing a decrease in engine performance and increased emissions. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idle, and poor acceleration. EGR valve replacement typically costs around $200-$400.

**4.4-liter V8**

* **Coil pack failure:** The coil packs may fail, leading to engine misfires and reduced performance. Symptoms include rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, and a check engine light. Each coil pack replacement costs around $50-$100.
* **Oxygen sensor failure:** The oxygen sensor may fail, affecting the engine's air-fuel ratio and reducing fuel economy. Symptoms include decreased fuel economy, poor engine performance, and a check engine light. Replacing the oxygen sensor typically costs around $100-$200.
* **Transmission fluid leaks:** The automatic transmission may develop leaks from the pan gasket, seals, or lines. Symptoms include low transmission fluid levels and a puddle of transmission fluid under the vehicle. Repairing transmission fluid leaks typically costs around $200-$400.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip gears, causing a loss of power or delayed acceleration. This issue is often caused by worn clutch plates or a faulty torque converter. Repairing transmission slipping typically costs around $2,000-$3,000.
* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoids may fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or refuse to shift gears. Symptoms include harsh shifting, delayed shifting, and a check engine light. Replacing shift solenoids typically costs around $500-$800.

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter may shudder or vibrate during acceleration or gear changes. This issue is often caused by worn or damaged torque converter components. Replacing the torque converter typically costs around $1,500-$2,500.
* **Transmission control module failure:** The transmission control module may fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or fail to shift gears. Symptoms include a check engine light, harsh shifting, and transmission failure. Replacing the transmission control module typically costs around $1,000-$1,500.

**Suspension**

* **Strut mount bearing failure:** The strut mount bearings may fail, causing a clunking or rattling noise when driving over bumps or turning. Replacing the strut mount bearings typically costs around $200-$400 per strut.
* **Control arm bushings worn:** The control arm bushings may wear out, leading to poor handling and stability. Symptoms include excessive tire wear, a loose or wobbly steering wheel, and clunking noises when turning. Replacing the control arm bushings typically costs around $300-$500 per side.
* **Sway bar links worn:** The sway bar links may wear out, causing a clunking or rattling noise when driving over bumps. Replacing the sway bar links typically costs around $100-$200 per side.

**Electrical**

* **Battery failure:** The battery may fail prematurely, especially in cold weather. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle, dim headlights, and a check battery light on the dashboard. Replacing the battery typically costs around $100-$200.
* **Alternator failure:** The alternator may fail, resulting in a loss of electrical power. Symptoms include a dim dashboard, flickering headlights, and a discharged battery. Replacing the alternator typically costs around $500-$800.
* **Wiring harness issues:** The electrical wiring harness may experience shorts or breaks, causing electrical issues throughout the vehicle. Symptoms can vary depending on the affected circuit. Repairing wiring harness issues typically costs around $200-$600.

**Exterior**

* **Roof rack crossbars peeling:** The roof rack crossbars may peel or corrode, especially on vehicles that are frequently exposed to salt or harsh weather. Replacing the roof rack crossbars typically costs around $200-$400.
* **Headlight bulb failure:** The headlight bulbs may fail prematurely, especially on vehicles with HID headlights. Symptoms include dim or flickering headlights. Replacing the headlight bulbs typically costs around $100-$300 per side.
* **Tailgate struts weak:** The tailgate struts may weaken over time, causing the tailgate to open slowly or not open at all. Replacing the tailgate struts typically costs around $200-$400.

**Interior**

* **Climate control knob failure:** The climate control knobs may break or become difficult to use. Replacing the climate control knobs typically costs around $50-$100.
* **Seat heaters malfunction:** The seat heaters may malfunction, causing the seats to not heat up or heat up unevenly. Replacing the seat heaters typically costs around $300-$500 per seat.
* **Instrument cluster failure:** The instrument cluster may fail, causing the speedometer, tachometer, or other gauges to stop working. Replacing the instrument cluster typically costs around $500-$800.

**Summary**

The 2005 Volvo XC90 has a number of potential issues that can be costly to repair.
