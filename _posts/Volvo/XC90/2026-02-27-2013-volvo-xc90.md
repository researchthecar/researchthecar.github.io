### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Volvo XC90 offers a blend of safety and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The inline-6 and V8 engines can experience oil leaks and PCV system problems, while the V8 may also face timing chain wear. Transmission issues like harsh shifting or TCM failure are also noted. Suspension components, particularly bushings and shocks, can wear over time. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and sensor malfunctions, are not uncommon. Interior issues like HVAC blower motors and sunroof mechanisms can also arise. Despite these potential concerns, many XC90s remain reliable with proper maintenance, but budgeting for potential repairs is advisable.
