### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Volvo XC90 offers a blend of safety and utility, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The gasoline engines, particularly the V8, can be prone to timing chain and oil leak problems, while the automatic transmission may develop issues with solenoids or the torque converter. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, and electrical gremlins, often linked to the CEM module, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, HVAC and sunroof drain issues can arise. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential problems are key to maintaining the XC90's reliability.
