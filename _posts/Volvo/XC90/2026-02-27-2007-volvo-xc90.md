### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volvo XC90 offers a blend of safety and luxury, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 2.5L turbo engine can suffer from PCV and turbo issues, while the V8 variant is prone to costly timing chain problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 5-speed, may develop solenoid or torque converter issues. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and CEM modules are also noted. Suspension components like strut mounts and control arm bushings can wear out. While the exterior is generally robust, interior issues like clogged sunroof drains can lead to water damage. Regular maintenance and proactive attention to these common problems are crucial for maintaining the XC90's overall reliability.
