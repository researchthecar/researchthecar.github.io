### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Volvo XC90 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly known for its safety and comfort. While it doesn't suffer from widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of potential issues related to the PCV system and camshaft sensors on the inline-6 engine, and timing chain wear on the V8. Transmission fluid leaks and solenoid issues can occur. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the CEM module, and interior climate control or infotainment system quirks are also noted. Proactive maintenance, especially fluid changes and addressing early signs of wear, can significantly mitigate these potential problems and ensure a dependable ownership experience.
