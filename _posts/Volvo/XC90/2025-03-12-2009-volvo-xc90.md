The 2009 Volvo XC90 is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its safety features and comfortable ride. In 2009, the XC90 was available with two engine options: a 3.2-liter inline-6 producing 235 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.4-liter V8 generating 311 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the XC90 for its spacious interior, comfortable seats, and solid build quality.
