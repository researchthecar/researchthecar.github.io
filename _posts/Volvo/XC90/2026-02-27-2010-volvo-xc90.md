### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Volvo XC90 offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly for its age and class. The most common concerns tend to revolve around the powertrain, with potential for oil leaks and timing chain issues on the inline-6, and camshaft seal leaks or PCV issues on the V8. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, are also noted, often requiring fluid services or more extensive repairs. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and headlight issues, are also present. While not immune to age-related wear, addressing these specific points can contribute to the long-term reliability of the XC90.
