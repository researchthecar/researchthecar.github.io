# 2003 Volvo XC90

### Overview
The 2003 Volvo XC90, a pioneering luxury mid-size SUV, aimed to blend Scandinavian safety with practicality and comfort. It was built on a platform shared with the S80 sedan, offering a car-like driving experience with the versatility of an SUV. Early models, particularly those from 2003, were the first to introduce many of Volvo's signature safety features and a distinctive design. While generally well-regarded for its safety and comfortable ride, like any first-generation vehicle, it has specific areas that have shown more wear or potential for issues over time, especially concerning its powertrain and some electronic components. Owners often praise its spacious interior and robust build quality, but maintenance and repair costs can be a consideration for this era of Volvo.

### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Volvo XC90, while a strong contender in its segment for safety and comfort, exhibits some common issues typical of its age and first-generation status. Powertrain components, particularly the automatic transmission solenoids and certain engine-specific issues like PCV system clogging or turbocharger wear on the 2.5L, are notable. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or CEM modules, are also a recurring concern. Suspension components like strut mounts and control arm bushings can wear out. Despite these potential drawbacks, addressing these issues proactively can help maintain the XC90's reliability and ensure its continued service. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for owners of this model.
