**Summary**

The 2008 Volvo XC90 can be a reliable and comfortable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that arise with age. Engine problems, particularly with the timing chain tensioner in the 3.2L and valve stem seals in the 4.4L, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the valve body, are also a significant concern. Electrical problems related to the DIM and CEM can be frustrating and expensive to diagnose and fix. Suspension issues like lower control arm bushings and rear air suspension (if equipped) can impact ride quality and handling. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite substantial, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
