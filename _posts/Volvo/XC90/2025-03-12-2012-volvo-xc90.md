The 2012 Volvo XC90 is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its safety, comfort, and spaciousness. Engine options included a 3.2L inline-6 engine producing 240 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.4L V8 engine that delivers 311 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the XC90's comfortable ride and family-friendly design, but some dislike its relatively poor fuel economy and aging infotainment system.
