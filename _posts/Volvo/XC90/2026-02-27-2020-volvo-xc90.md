### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Volvo XC90 demonstrates solid reliability, particularly in its core mechanical components like the engine and transmission, with the T5 and T6 engines showing minimal widespread issues. The primary concerns tend to be concentrated in the advanced electrical systems, specifically the infotainment unit, which can experience software glitches, and occasional reports of premature 12V battery failure. The plug-in hybrid (T8) variant, while offering excellent efficiency, carries a higher potential for complex hybrid system repairs. Air suspension systems, if equipped, can also be a source of repair costs due to potential leaks. Overall, the XC90 is a dependable luxury SUV, but owners should be aware of potential electrical gremlins and the higher stakes associated with hybrid powertrain maintenance.
