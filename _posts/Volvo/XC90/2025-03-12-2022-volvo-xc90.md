Owners appreciate the XC90's elegant design and premium features, but some have reported issues with the infotainment system and electrical components.

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sensus infotainment system, which controls navigation, audio, and climate functions, may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can occur intermittently or frequently, requiring a system reboot.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Volvo can often resolve these issues. In some cases, replacing the infotainment system's central control module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,200+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not in use, leading to difficulty starting the engine. This could be caused by a faulty battery or an electrical component draining power while the vehicle is off.
    *   Solution: First, test the battery to ensure that it is still functioning properly. Then, inspect the system for a parasitic drain using a multimeter. Replacing the battery is the next step if it fails the test, or if it passes the test, tracking down the draw and replacing the affected module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattle/Creaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may produce rattling or creaking noises when driving over uneven surfaces or at certain speeds.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and lubricating the sunroof tracks and seals can sometimes resolve the issue. In some cases, the sunroof assembly may need to be adjusted or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (lubrication/adjustment), $800+ (assembly replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver's Seat Movement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive movement in the drivers seat while driving.
    *   Solution: Replacing the whole seat assembly can fix the issue.

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with air suspension, it may experience issues such as sagging, uneven ride height, or complete failure of the system. This can be caused by leaks in the air struts, a faulty air compressor, or issues with the control module.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts, air compressor, or control module can resolve the issue. It's important to diagnose the specific cause of the failure before replacing any components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (per strut), $500 - $1,000+ (compressor), $300 - $800+ (control module)

**Summary:**

The 2022 Volvo XC90 is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with the infotainment system, interior components, and occasionally the transmission or air suspension. The infotainment system and battery drain issues seem to be the most prevalent. Costs to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements or software updates to several thousand dollars for major component repairs such as replacing the transmission or air suspension components. While not widespread, these issues are worth noting for prospective buyers.
