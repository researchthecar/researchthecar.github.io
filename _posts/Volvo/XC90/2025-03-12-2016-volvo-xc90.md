The 2016 Volvo XC90 marked a significant redesign for Volvo's flagship SUV. It was offered with a 2.0L turbocharged and supercharged inline-4 engine (T6) producing 316 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor (T8 Twin Engine Plug-In Hybrid). Both powertrains are paired with an Aisin Warner 8-speed automatic transmission. The XC90 is generally praised for its elegant Scandinavian design, comfortable interior, and advanced safety features. However, some common criticisms include the complex infotainment system and occasional reliability concerns.
