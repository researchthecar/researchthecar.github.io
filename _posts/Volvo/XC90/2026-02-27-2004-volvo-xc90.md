### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volvo XC90 is a capable and safe SUV, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the engine and transmission, especially the automatic gearbox. The 2.5L turbo-5 is generally more reliable than the V8, which can suffer from more costly timing chain issues. Electrical gremlins, often related to the CEM module, are also a common concern. Suspension components like sway bar links and strut mounts are typical wear items for a vehicle of this age. While not immune to problems, addressing these known issues proactively can help maintain the XC90's comfort and utility.
