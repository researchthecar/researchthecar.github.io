The 2009 Acura MDX is a popular luxury SUV known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. The MDX came equipped with a single engine option: a 3.7-liter V6 producing 300 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the MDX for its performance, handling, and Acura's reputation for reliability. Common dislikes include less-than-stellar fuel economy and some reported issues with certain electronic components.

    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from using a heavier-weight oil, performing an engine flush, or, in more severe cases, replacing the piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTEC Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) solenoid can fail, leading to a loss of power, rough idle, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty VTEC solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Flare**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A momentary increase in engine RPMs between shifts, without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed (shift flare), can indicate internal transmission wear.
    *   Solution: Fluid change, valve body replacement, or full transmission rebuild/replacement, depending on severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3,000+
