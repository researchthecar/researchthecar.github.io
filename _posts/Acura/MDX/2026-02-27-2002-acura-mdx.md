### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Acura MDX is a generally reliable vehicle, especially considering its age. The powertrain, particularly the V6 engine, is robust if maintained. However, common issues for vehicles of this vintage include the timing belt, rear main seal leaks, and potential transmission problems if fluid changes were neglected. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as power window motors and alternators, can occur. Addressing these potential issues proactively, especially the timing belt replacement, can significantly extend the life and maintain the reliability of the 2002 MDX.
