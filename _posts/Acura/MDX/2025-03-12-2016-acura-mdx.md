The 2016 Acura MDX is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While it's generally considered a dependable vehicle, some owners have reported specific issues.
