The 2022 Acura MDX represents the fourth generation of Acura's popular three-row SUV. It offers a blend of luxury, performance, and practicality. The standard engine is a 3.5-liter V6 producing 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A Type S variant is also available featuring a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 engine that produces 355 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque, also paired with the 10-speed automatic. People generally praise the MDX for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and long list of standard features. Common complaints include the sometimes-frustrating infotainment system and the lack of a hybrid powertrain option, which competitors often offer.

**Summary:**

The 2022 Acura MDX, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, does have its share of common issues. Engine problems like VTC actuator noise and turbo lag (Type S) can be concerning but may not always be severe. Transmission issues appear to be more significant, with reports of rough shifting and, in some cases, complete failure, leading to potentially high repair costs. Electrical problems with the infotainment system are also fairly common and can be frustrating. Suspension and interior noise issues are less severe but can detract from the overall luxury experience. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used MDX before purchase, paying close attention to the transmission's performance. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major repairs like transmission replacement.
