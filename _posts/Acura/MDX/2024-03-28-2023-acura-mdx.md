**Introduction:**

The 2023 Acura MDX is a midsize luxury SUV that offers three engine options: a 3.5L V6, a 3.0L V6 turbocharged hybrid, and a 3.5L V6 turbocharged. The V6 engine produces 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, while the turbocharged V6 produces 355 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.
