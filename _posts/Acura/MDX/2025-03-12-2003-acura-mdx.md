The 2003 Acura MDX is a popular luxury mid-size SUV known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 260 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the MDX for its build quality and smooth driving experience. Common complaints often revolve around age-related issues, such as suspension wear and some electrical quirks, rather than major design flaws.
