### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Acura MDX is a generally reliable luxury SUV, but like many vehicles of its vintage, it is susceptible to certain age-related issues. The most commonly cited concerns revolve around the engine's VCM system and timing belt tensioner, as well as potential transmission shudder and electrical gremlins like power window motors. Suspension components such as sway bar links and struts can also wear out. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning the timing belt and transmission fluid, along with addressing early signs of VCM issues, can significantly mitigate the risk of major repairs. Overall, with diligent care, the MDX can remain a dependable vehicle.
