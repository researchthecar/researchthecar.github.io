The 2020 Acura MDX is a luxury three-row SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. It's powered primarily by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Some models also come with Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system. While generally well-regarded, some owners have reported certain issues. Owners typically like the vehicle's reliability, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. Common dislikes include the lack of a traditional gear shifter, the outdated infotainment system graphics, and occasionally clunky transmission shifts.

Electrical gremlins such as battery drain and infotainment glitches are also present. While the cost of repairs can be significant, especially for transmission or engine work, many of the issues can be addressed with software updates or component replacements. It would be wise to have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic before buying one, especially the transmission.
