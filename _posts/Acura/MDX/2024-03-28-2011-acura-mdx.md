## 2011 Acura MDX

The 2011 Acura MDX is a luxury midsize crossover SUV with seating for up to seven passengers. It comes with a 3.7-liter V6 engine that produces 300 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The MDX is known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and high-end features. However, it has also received some consumer complaints regarding reliability issues.

## Engine

**3.7-liter V6**

* **Valve Timing Solenoid Failure:** This issue affects the solenoid that controls the variable valve timing system. Symptoms include rough idling, poor engine performance, and a check engine light. The faulty solenoid must be replaced. The repair cost ranges from $400 - $600+.
* **Oil leaks from the VVT system:** Oil leaks can occur from the variable valve timing (VVT) system, specifically from the VVT solenoids or the VVT actuator. Symptoms may include an oil leak under the vehicle, low oil levels, and an illuminated oil pressure warning light. Replacing the faulty VVT components can resolve the issue. The repair cost depends on the affected components and labor charges.

## Transmission

**6-speed Automatic**

* **Hesitation or jerking during gear shifts:** Some owners have reported hesitation or jerking during gear shifts, especially when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear or from 2nd to 3rd gear. The issue may be caused by faulty solenoids or other transmission components. Repairing or replacing the affected parts can address the problem. The cost of the repair can vary based on the extent of the issue and the labor involved.
* **Transmission failure:** Some vehicles have experienced premature transmission failure. Symptoms may include slipping gears, difficulty shifting, or complete loss of power. The transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced. The cost of a transmission rebuild or replacement can be significant.

## Suspension

* **Strut mount bearing failure:** Front strut mount bearings can fail, causing a clunking or grinding noise when turning or going over bumps. Replacing the strut mount bearings can resolve the issue. The cost of the repair typically ranges from $200 - $400+ per side.

## Electrical

* **Electrical system failure:** Some MDX models have experienced electrical system failures, resulting in a loss of power or various electrical malfunctions. The issue may be caused by a faulty alternator, battery, or wiring harness. Diagnosis and repair of the electrical system can vary in cost depending on the root cause of the issue.
* **Backup camera failure:** The backup camera may fail due to a loose or damaged connection, a faulty camera module, or a software glitch. Replacing the camera module or repairing the connection can resolve the issue. The cost of the repair depends on the specific problem and labor charges.

## Exterior

* **Windshield wiper motor failure:** The windshield wiper motor can fail, causing the wipers to stop working. Replacement of the wiper motor is necessary to restore wiper functionality. The cost of the repair typically ranges from $200 - $400+.
* **Rear liftgate issues:** Some owners have reported issues with the rear liftgate, such as difficulty opening or closing, or getting stuck in a partially open position. The problem may be caused by faulty sensors, switches, or mechanical components within the liftgate system. Repairing or replacing the affected parts can address the issue. The cost of the repair depends on the nature of the problem and labor charges.

## Interior

* **Climate control malfunction:** Issues with the climate control system have been reported, such as failing to regulate temperature effectively or producing unusual noises. The issue may be caused by faulty sensors, actuators, or other climate control components. Diagnosis and repair of the climate control system can vary in cost depending on the specific problem.
* **Navigation system malfunction:** The navigation system may malfunction, causing errors or displaying incorrect information. Updating the navigation software or replacing faulty components can resolve the issue. The cost of the repair depends on the severity of the malfunction and the parts or labor required.

## Summary

The 2011 Acura MDX is a popular luxury crossover with a strong engine and comfortable interior. However, several reliability issues have been reported by owners, including problems with the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and various components in the exterior and interior.
