The 1999 Acura CL was a mid-size coupe available in two trims: the 2.3CL and the 3.0CL. The 2.3CL was equipped with a 2.3-liter inline-4 engine producing 150 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque. The 3.0CL featured a 3.0-liter V6 engine generating 200 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.3CL came standard with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0CL also had a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the CL for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and Acura's reputation for reliability. Common criticisms include the relatively soft suspension, limited rear seat space, and some age-related issues.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets, including the valve cover gasket and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.3L, oil leaks can occur from valve cover gaskets, oil pan gaskets, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, or fluctuating RPMs at idle.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both 2.3L and 3.0L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during gear changes, slipping between gears, or hard, jerky shifts. This is often due to worn clutch packs or solenoid issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid and filter is often the first step. If that doesn't solve the issue, a transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter) or $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and vague steering. This can be caused by worn control arm bushings or sway bar bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings. Replacing the entire control arm can be more cost-effective in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the bushing and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and bottoming out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the struts/shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (for a pair of struts/shocks installed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to operate, intermittent operation, or slow operation. This could be caused by a failing window motor or a broken regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor and/or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 1999 Acura CL, while generally reliable for its age, does have some common issues. Engine oil leaks are relatively common, as is normal wear and tear on the suspension components like bushings and struts. Electrical gremlins like power window and door lock failures are also a concern. The transmission, while typically robust, can experience shifting problems with age and mileage. Rust can be a significant concern in certain climates. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, but prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems when considering a 1999 Acura CL.
