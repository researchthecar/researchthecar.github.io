The 1997 Acura CL was offered as a sporty coupe, available in two main trims: the CL 2.2 and the CL 3.0. The CL 2.2 came with a 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine producing 145 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. The CL 3.0 featured a 3.0-liter V6 engine rated at 200 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission for the 2.2L model. Owners generally appreciated the CL for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and Acura's reputation for reliability.
