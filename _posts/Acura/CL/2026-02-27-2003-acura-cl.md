### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Acura CL offers a blend of sporty performance and Acura's typical reliability. While generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil consumption and timing belt concerns on the V6 engine, and torque converter shudder on the automatic transmission. The 4-cylinder engine is generally more straightforward. Electrical components like the alternator and power window motors can also require attention. Exterior paint and interior components like the HVAC resistor are also noted areas. Despite these points, with proper maintenance and addressing these common issues, the 2003 CL can remain a reliable and enjoyable vehicle.
