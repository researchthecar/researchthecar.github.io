* **Alternator Problems:** The alternator may fail to charge the battery, leading to electrical system malfunctions.

**Summary:**

The 2002 Acura CL is a capable vehicle that offers an enjoyable driving experience. However, it has encountered several issues that can impact its reliability and performance.
