The 2001 Acura CL is a front-wheel-drive coupe that was available with two engine options: a 2.3L inline-4 (I4) engine producing 150 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L V6 engine producing 225 horsepower and 216 lb-ft of torque. The I4 was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 was offered with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission (though the 5-speed manual was only available in the later years of the second-generation CL). Owners generally appreciate the car's sporty handling, comfortable interior, and Acura's reputation for reliability. Common complaints include the automatic transmission issues, especially in the earlier models, and some electrical quirks.

**Summary**

The V6 engine can also experience oil leaks, and the suspension and electrical systems can develop age-related problems. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the car's performance and longevity. The most expensive potential repair is the automatic transmission, with a rebuild or replacement costing several thousand dollars. While the manual transmission and I4 engine have shown no prevalent issues.
