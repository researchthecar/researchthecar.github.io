The 1998 Acura CL was a sporty coupe offered in two trims: the 2.3CL and the 3.0CL. The 2.3CL was powered by a 2.3-liter inline-4 engine producing 150 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0CL featured a 3.0-liter V6 engine generating 200 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, also mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CL for its comfortable ride, sleek styling, and Acura's reputation for reliability. Common complaints include the automatic transmission's sluggishness, the dated interior design, and some maintenance issues that arise with age.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-4**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets as the engine ages, including the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots under the car, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

*   **Distributor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting issues, rough running, misfires, and eventually a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replace the distributor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**3.0L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.3L, oil leaks can develop from valve cover gaskets, oil pan gaskets, and other seals. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, oil spots, and burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Transmission Slippage/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip between gears, shift harshly, or fail to shift at all. This is often due to worn clutch packs or a failing solenoid.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the transmission. A temporary fix sometimes involves a transmission fluid flush and filter change but this is not a guaranteed fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at low speeds or during acceleration. May also cause stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in corners.
    *   Solution: Replace the struts/shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working, move slowly, or only work intermittently. This is often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.

**Summary**

The 1998 Acura CL, while generally reliable, can experience issues common to vehicles of its age. Engine oil leaks, transmission problems (particularly slipping and harsh shifting), and suspension wear are among the most frequently reported issues. Electrical issues, such as power window failures, and rust are also concerns. The severity and cost of these issues can vary significantly, from relatively inexpensive repairs like replacing a gasket to more costly overhauls like rebuilding the transmission. Addressing these potential problems proactively can help maintain the CL's performance and extend its lifespan.
