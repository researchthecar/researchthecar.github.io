The 2003 Acura CL is a mid-size coupe that was available in two trims: the CL and the CL Type-S. The base CL came with a 3.0L V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Type-S was equipped with a 3.2L V6 engine producing 260 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. This engine was available with either a 5-speed automatic transmission or a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciate the CL for its comfortable ride, sporty handling (especially the Type-S), and Acura reliability. Common complaints include some electrical gremlins, premature transmission wear in the automatics, and age-related issues with the suspension.
