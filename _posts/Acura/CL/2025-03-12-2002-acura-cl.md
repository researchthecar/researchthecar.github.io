The 2002 Acura CL is a stylish and sporty coupe that aimed to offer a blend of luxury and performance. It was available with two engine options: a 2.3L inline-4 VTEC engine producing 150 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L V6 VTEC engine producing 225 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque. The 2.3L was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.2L could be had with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual (in the Type-S model). Many owners appreciate the CL for its comfortable ride, attractive styling, and available features. Some criticisms include the automatic transmission's reliability, and the fact that the model was not offered in subsequent model years.
