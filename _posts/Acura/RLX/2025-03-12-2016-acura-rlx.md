The 2016 Acura RLX is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a host of technology features. Engine options include a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with a 7-speed dual clutch transmission and a Sport Hybrid SH-AWD (Super Handling All-Wheel Drive) system, producing 377 horsepower and 341 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the RLX for its spacious interior, quiet cabin, and advanced safety features. Some criticisms include a somewhat uninspired exterior design and a infotainment system that is not as user-friendly as some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (Non-Hybrid)**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idle, and potential damage to spark plugs. This is caused by the VCM system deactivating cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system with an aftermarket VCM disabler device, which prevents the engine from switching to 3-cylinder mode. A more permanent solution is to rebuild the engine to address the root cause of the oil consumption, such as replacing piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (VCM disabler) to $2,000 - $5,000+ (Engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 Hybrid**

*   **IMA (Integrated Motor Assist) System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hybrid battery degradation, reduced electric assist, and error messages related to the hybrid system.
    *   Solution: Hybrid battery replacement or individual module replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Non-Hybrid)**

No Issues Found

**7-Speed Dual Clutch Transmission (Hybrid)**

*   **DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission) Shudder/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, hesitation, or rough shifting, particularly at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Software update, transmission fluid change, or, in severe cases, transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) to $500 (software update) to $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard indicating a problem with the adaptive damper system. Ride quality becomes harsh or uneven.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the affected damper and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500 per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system becomes unresponsive, freezes, or crashes frequently. Navigation may fail, and audio controls may be affected.
    *   Solution: Software updates may address the issue, but in some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,000+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car is left sitting for a few days. This can be caused by parasitic drain from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic drain and repair or replace the faulty component. This can involve testing various circuits and modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulates inside the headlight housings, causing condensation and potentially reducing headlight effectiveness.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight assembly is the most common solution. Some owners attempt to dry out the housings and reseal them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500 per headlight (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may fail to open or close properly, get stuck, or leak.
    *   Solution: Inspect sunroof tracks for debris, lubricate moving parts, or replace the sunroof motor or assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (lubrication/cleaning) to $500+ (motor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks may fail to lock or unlock, or may function intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per actuator
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Acura RLX has some common issues, with the hybrid powertrain potentially being the most problematic due to the potential for expensive battery and transmission repairs. The non-hybrid V6 engine can suffer from VCM issues that can lead to excessive oil consumption. Electrical problems like infotainment glitches and battery drain can also be frustrating. While most of these issues are not catastrophic, they can be costly to repair, especially for the hybrid model. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed, especially on the hybrid model, and be prepared for the possibility of these repairs down the line.
