The 2020 Acura RLX is a mid-size luxury sedan that prioritizes comfort and technology over outright sportiness. The RLX was available in two configurations: a front-wheel-drive model with Acura's Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS) system, powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and a Sport Hybrid SH-AWD model that combines the same 3.5-liter V6 with three electric motors for a total system output of 377 horsepower. The Sport Hybrid uses a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the RLX for its quiet and spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and impressive suite of standard technology features. However, some criticize its somewhat dated styling, lack of brand prestige compared to European rivals, and the Sport Hybrid's complex powertrain, which can occasionally feel less refined than traditional drivetrains.

**Summary**

The 2020 Acura RLX has relatively few widespread issues, especially compared to other luxury sedans in its class. The most commonly reported problems include infotainment system glitches and rough shifting with the 10-speed automatic transmission. The oil consumption issue with the 3.5L V6 is also worth noting. The headlight issue isn't necessarily a defect but more of a common complaint that owners replace the factory bulbs with aftermarket ones. While the infotainment glitches can be annoying, most issues are relatively minor and don't typically lead to major repair costs. However, the potential for sensor replacement in the adaptive cruise control system could result in moderate expenses. Overall, the RLX appears to be a reasonably reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and address them during a pre-purchase inspection.
