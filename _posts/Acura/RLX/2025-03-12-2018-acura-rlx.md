Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Acura RLX, categorized by component and powertrain, following your specified format.

The 2018 Acura RLX is a mid-size luxury sedan. It was offered with two powertrain options: a 3.5L V6 engine with front-wheel drive and Acura's Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS), and a 3.5L V6 engine paired with a three-motor hybrid system and Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD).

**Summary**

The 2018 Acura RLX, while offering a comfortable and feature-rich experience, can suffer from a range of issues. The most concerning and potentially costly are related to the hybrid system's battery degradation and the DCT clutch issues in the hybrid model. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system and driver-assistance features, can also be frustrating. The non-hybrid model may experience oil leaks and harsh shifting, but these are generally less severe than the hybrid-specific problems. Overall, while the RLX presents a good value in the luxury sedan market, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when making their decision.
