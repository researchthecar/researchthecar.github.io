The 2017 Acura RLX is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a suite of technology features. The standard engine is a 3.5-liter V6 producing 310 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. An optional Sport Hybrid SH-AWD model combines the V6 with a three-motor hybrid system and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission, boosting total output to 377 horsepower. RLX owners often praise the car's quiet cabin, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. However, some common complaints include the somewhat dated infotainment system and less engaging driving dynamics compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2017 Acura RLX has some common issues, mostly centered around the infotainment system, torque converter for the non-hybrid with the 6-speed, and adaptive dampers. The severity of these issues varies, with some being relatively minor inconveniences (infotainment glitches) and others requiring more significant repairs (torque converter replacement). The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for major component replacements. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
