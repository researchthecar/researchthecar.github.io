The 2014 Acura RLX was Acura's flagship sedan, aiming to blend luxury with technology and performance. The standard and most common engine option was a 3.5-liter V6 producing 310 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid variant, the RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD, was also available, combining the 3.5-liter V6 with electric motors and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praised the RLX for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and advanced technology features. Criticisms frequently included a somewhat bland exterior styling compared to competitors and a less engaging driving experience than some other luxury sedans.
