The 2015 Acura RLX is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and advanced technology. The standard engine is a 3.5-liter V6 producing 310 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. An RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD variant was also available, combining the 3.5-liter V6 with a three-motor hybrid system and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission, boosting total system output to 377 horsepower. Owners typically appreciate the RLX for its value compared to European competitors, its quiet cabin, and its reliability. Common complaints often revolve around the somewhat dated infotainment system, the lack of visual excitement in the styling, and the non-availability of all-wheel drive on the standard V6 model.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Timing Control (VTC) Actuator Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start-up, especially in colder weather. This is due to the VTC actuator not holding oil pressure correctly when the engine is off.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VTC actuator with an updated part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the rear main seal or valve cover gaskets.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking seals or gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on location of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 Hybrid**

*   **Electric Motor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hybrid system warning lights, reduced power, issues with regenerative braking, or the engine stalling when the electric motor fails.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the exact motor failing. Replacement of the faulty electric motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
