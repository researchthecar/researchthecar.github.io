The 2019 Acura RLX is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a blend of comfort, technology, and performance. The standard engine option is a 3.5-liter V6 producing 310 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. There is also a hybrid version available with a 3.5-liter V6, three electric motors, and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission producing a combined 377 horsepower. Owners generally appreciate the RLX's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and abundance of standard features. Criticisms often focus on its somewhat dated styling, lack of brand prestige compared to European rivals, and the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported oil leaks developing from various engine seals and gaskets, such as the valve cover gaskets or the oil pan gasket. Symptoms can include visible oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VCM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can sometimes cause vibrations, rough idling, and increased oil consumption in some cases.
    *   Solution: Some owners have tried using aftermarket devices to disable VCM. Other solutions include software updates to adjust the VCM system or replacing faulty VCM components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for aftermarket devices) - $500+ for more involved repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 Hybrid (Sport Hybrid SH-AWD)**

*   **Hybrid Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature degradation or failure of the hybrid battery pack. Symptoms include reduced electric driving range, decreased fuel economy, and warning lights related to the hybrid system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hybrid battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the source of the battery and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (3.5L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or transmission fluid change can improve the shifting behavior. In more severe cases, internal transmission repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 (fluid change) to $3,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed Dual Clutch Transmission (3.5L V6 Hybrid)**

*   **Jerky or Hesitant Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced jerky or hesitant shifting, particularly at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This can be due to the nature of dual-clutch transmissions but can be exacerbated by wear or software issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) or clutch recalibration. In some cases, clutch replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for software updates or recalibration, $2,000+ for clutch replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The RLX features an adaptive damper system designed to adjust suspension firmness based on driving conditions. Some owners have reported malfunctions in this system, resulting in a harsh or uncomfortable ride, error messages, or the system defaulting to a fixed setting.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty dampers, sensors, or control modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per damper, depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The RLX's infotainment system, while feature-rich, has been reported to have issues such as slow response times, freezing, glitches, and difficulty connecting to smartphones.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) to $1,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) / LKAS (Lane Keeping Assist System) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the advanced driver-assistance systems, such as ACC or LKAS, can arise. These may manifest as the systems disengaging unexpectedly, providing inaccurate readings, or failing to function altogether.
    *   Solution: Calibration of the system sensors, replacement of faulty sensors or control modules, or software updates.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the component needing repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2019 Acura RLX, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine oil leaks and potential VCM issues are concerns for the standard V6, while hybrid models may face battery issues. Transmission issues (harsh shifting or jerky behavior) can arise in both the 10-speed and 7-speed DCT. Adaptive suspension problems and electrical glitches in the infotainment and driver-assistance systems are also noted. While some issues like software updates are inexpensive, others, such as hybrid battery replacement or transmission overhauls, can be quite costly. Overall, the RLX seems to have mild to moderate severity issues that can vary greatly in cost. A pre-purchase inspection is recommended.
