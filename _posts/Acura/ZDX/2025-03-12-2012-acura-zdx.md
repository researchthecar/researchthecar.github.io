The 2012 Acura ZDX is a unique crossover coupe that aimed to blend luxury, style, and practicality. It was only offered with one engine option: a 3.7-liter V6 engine that produces 300 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The ZDX was praised for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and standard features. However, its polarizing styling and limited rear visibility were often criticized, contributing to its relatively short production run. Here's a breakdown of common issues reported by owners:

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms may include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke, and engine knocking.
    * Solution: Addressing excessive oil consumption can involve several steps, starting with checking for leaks and performing a compression test to assess the condition of the piston rings and cylinders. If the rings are worn, a rebuild or replacement of the engine may be necessary. Using a thicker oil or oil additives might temporarily reduce consumption but isn't a long-term solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$5000+ (depending on the extent of the issue and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VTEC Solenoid Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The VTEC (Variable Timing and Lift Electronic Control) solenoid can fail, leading to reduced engine performance, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty VTEC solenoid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported torque converter issues such as shuddering or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can also manifest as rough shifting or a feeling of slippage.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush may alleviate the issue in some cases. In more severe cases, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $1500+ (torque converter replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, especially between certain gears. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid change using genuine Honda/Acura ATF-DW1 fluid is the first step. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission valve body and solenoids may be needed, potentially requiring replacement of affected components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some models are equipped with an air suspension system. Problems can arise with the air struts or air compressor, leading to a sagging rear end, a rough ride, or the suspension failing to level the vehicle.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty component (air strut, compressor, or air lines) and replacement of the affected part.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per strut or compressor replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Navigation System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation system can experience glitches, freezing, or inaccurate GPS positioning. The screen may also fade or become unresponsive.
    * Solution: A software update might resolve some issues. However, in more severe cases, the navigation unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software Update) - $1000+ (Unit Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Bluetooth Connectivity Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, or poor sound quality during calls.
    * Solution: Attempting to reset the Bluetooth module, updating the vehicle's software, or replacing the Bluetooth module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (Module Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, fail to open or close properly, or leak.
    * Solution: Lubrication of the sunroof tracks, repair or replacement of the sunroof motor or mechanism, and sealing any leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Heated Seat Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The heated seats may stop working or become only partially functional.
    * Solution: Replacement of the heating element or control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per seat.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Acura ZDX, while stylish and comfortable, does have some common issues owners report. Engine issues like oil consumption can be costly to address. Transmission issues can range from minor inconveniences to more significant repairs. Suspension and electrical problems can also arise, potentially impacting the driving experience and adding to the overall cost of ownership. While some issues may be relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others could require more substantial investment. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any ZDX they are considering purchasing.
