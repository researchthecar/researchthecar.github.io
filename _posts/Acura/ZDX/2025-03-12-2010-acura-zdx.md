The 2010 Acura ZDX was a unique crossover coupe known for its distinctive styling and luxurious features. It came standard with a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated its comfortable ride, upscale interior, and standard all-wheel-drive. However, the ZDX's polarizing design, limited rear passenger space, and compromised cargo capacity were common points of criticism.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported the 3.7L V6 consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke (particularly upon startup), and the need to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings and valve seals can resolve the issue. A compression test can help determine the extent of the internal wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTEC Solenoid Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the VTEC solenoid gasket, leading to oil dripping onto the engine and potential for low oil levels. Visible oil accumulation around the VTEC solenoid is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replace the VTEC solenoid gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Control Solenoid Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, often accompanied by a code related to the evaporative emission control (EVAP) system. Rough idling and difficulty starting may also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the purge control solenoid valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration during light acceleration, particularly at lower speeds (around 20-40 mph). This is often caused by wear or degradation of the torque converter clutch.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush *may* temporarily alleviate the issue, but ultimately, torque converter replacement is the most reliable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 (for fluid flush) to $1,000 - $2,500+ (for torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays in gear changes, especially when shifting from park or reverse to drive. Harsh or jerky shifts between gears can also occur.
    *   Solution: Could be related to low transmission fluid or a faulty solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over bumps. Visible leaks from the shocks may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system may freeze, become unresponsive, display error messages, or fail to load maps correctly. This can be due to software glitches or hardware failures.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the system, updating the software (if available), or, in severe cases, replacing the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) to $500 - $1,500+ (navigation unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Tailgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power tailgate may fail to open or close properly, stop mid-cycle, or make unusual noises. This can be due to a faulty motor, sensor, or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Check the tailgate struts, sensors, and the motor. Replace faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck or make grinding noises when operating.
    *   Solution: Clean the sunroof tracks and lubricate them. If that does not work, the sunroof motor or components will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, or distorted audio during phone calls. Software glitches or compatibility issues are common causes.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the Bluetooth system, updating the phone's software, or checking for compatibility issues with the vehicle's system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) to $100 - $300 (module replacement if needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Heated Seat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heated seats may fail to warm up, or only warm up partially. This can be due to a faulty heating element, wiring issue, or switch failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the problem by testing the heating element, wiring, and switch. Replace any faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Acura ZDX has some potential problem areas that buyers should be aware of. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and leaks can be costly to repair. Transmission issues are less common, but can still be a concern. Electrical glitches, especially with the navigation system and power tailgate, are also common. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to substantial repair bills, making it important to thoroughly inspect any used ZDX and address any known issues proactively. The severity of these issues varies, with some leading to more expensive repairs than others. Buyers should factor in the potential costs when considering a used ZDX.
