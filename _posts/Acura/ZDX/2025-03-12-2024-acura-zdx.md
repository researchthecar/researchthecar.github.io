The 2024 Acura ZDX marks Acura's entry into the all-electric SUV market. It offers two powertrain options: a single-motor rear-wheel-drive configuration producing 340 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, and a dual-motor all-wheel-drive configuration boosting output to 420 hp and 370 lb-ft of torque. A high-performance Type S variant is also available with the dual-motor setup, increasing output to 500 hp.  Many reviewers praise the ZDX for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and Acura's reputation for reliability. Criticisms often center around the pricing compared to competitors and the adoption of Google-based infotainment which some find less intuitive than Acura's previous systems. The ZDX only comes in an all-electric configuration, so there are no engine or transmission options.
