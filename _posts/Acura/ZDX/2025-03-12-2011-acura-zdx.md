The 2011 Acura ZDX is a luxury crossover coupe that was only offered with one engine and transmission option: a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While some appreciate its unique styling and comfortable ride, others criticize its limited rear visibility, sloping roofline that compromises rear passenger headroom and cargo space, and polarizing design. It also didn't have a very long production run, so parts can be more difficult to come by.
