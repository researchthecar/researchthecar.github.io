The 2024 Acura RDX is a luxury compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and standard features. The RDX comes with a single engine option: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 272 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the RDX's value for money, strong performance, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired infotainment system and the lack of a hybrid or more fuel-efficient powertrain option.

The infotainment system issues are more of a nuisance but can detract from the overall luxury experience. The suspension issues are specific to the Advance Package.
