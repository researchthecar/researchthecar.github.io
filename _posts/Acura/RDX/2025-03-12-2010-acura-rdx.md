The 2010 Acura RDX is a compact luxury SUV that's generally praised for its sporty handling, comfortable ride, and overall reliability. However, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential issues. The 2010 RDX came standard with a turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. It was paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the RDX's nimble handling and the turbocharged engine's power. Dislikes often revolve around the less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to other SUVs in its class and some concerns about potential turbocharger-related issues.
