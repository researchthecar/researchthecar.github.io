The 2007 Acura RDX marked Acura's entry into the compact luxury SUV market. It was exclusively offered with a 2.3L turbocharged inline-4 engine, producing 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the RDX for its sporty handling, responsive engine, and Acura's reliability. However, some common complaints included turbo lag, relatively stiff ride, and the lack of a V6 engine option for smoother power delivery.

**Summary**

The 2007 Acura RDX, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most prevalent issues relate to the engine's turbocharger, timing chain, and oil consumption, and the transmission's shifting behavior. These can range in severity and cost, with turbocharger and transmission problems potentially being the most expensive to address. Suspension and electrical issues are also present, but tend to be less critical.
