The 2015 Acura RDX is a compact luxury crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 273 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. There were no other engine or transmission options available. Owners appreciate the RDX for its value, practicality, and relatively sporty handling compared to competitors. Common complaints include a somewhat dated infotainment system and a less engaging driving experience compared to some European rivals.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, and engine vibration can occur due to the VCM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. This can lead to misfires and catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices like VCM Tuner II. Replace spark plugs and potentially catalytic converter if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: VCM Tuner II ($100+), Spark Plug Replacement ($150 - $300), Catalytic Converter Replacement ($800 - $2000+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt/Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While not a frequent issue, the timing belt on the 3.5L V6 needs replacement at recommended intervals. Failure to do so can result in catastrophic engine damage. The water pump is often replaced at the same time as preventative maintenance.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt and water pump at the recommended interval (usually around 100,000 miles).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Timing Belt/Water Pump Replacement ($700 - $1200+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report occasional delayed or harsh shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can sometimes be addressed with a software update or fluid change.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid change using Acura Genuine ATF-DW1 fluid. Check for software updates. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission Fluid Change ($150 - $300), Valve Body Replacement ($800 - $1500+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Strut Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or leakage from the rear struts, leading to a bouncy ride and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Rear Strut Replacement ($400 - $800+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight or within a few days of being parked.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested. Check for parasitic draws from aftermarket accessories or faulty components. Replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery Replacement ($150 - $300), Parasitic Draw Diagnosis ($100 - $200+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Freezing or Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation or infotainment system can freeze, become unresponsive, or reboot intermittently.
    * Solution: Try performing a hard reset of the system. Check for software updates. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need replacement.

    *   Solution: Clean and lubricate the sunroof tracks and seals. Replace the sunroof motor or regulator if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Sunroof Motor/Regulator Replacement ($300 - $800+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Acura RDX is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. The most prevalent seem to be related to the VCM system causing excessive oil consumption, and occasional transmission shifting issues. Other reported issues include rear strut wear, electrical problems like battery drain, and sunroof malfunctions. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, particularly if the catalytic converter is damaged due to VCM-related oil consumption. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for a fluid change or part replacement to over $2000+ for catalytic converter replacement.
