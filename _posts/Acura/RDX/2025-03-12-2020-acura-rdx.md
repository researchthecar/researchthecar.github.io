The 2020 Acura RDX is a popular compact luxury SUV known for its sporty handling, spacious interior, and generous standard features. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 272 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a 10-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the RDX's value proposition, engaging driving experience, and comfortable seats. However, some criticisms include the touchpad infotainment system, which many find distracting to use while driving, and occasional complaints about road noise.
