The 2018 Acura RDX is a compact luxury SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 279 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the RDX's value proposition, smooth powertrain, and ample cargo space. However, some common complaints include the lack of the latest technology features (compared to newer models), and some find the infotainment system to be dated.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can cause misfires, rough idling, and vibrations. This is often exacerbated by oil fouling on spark plugs due to excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Install a VCM disabler device to prevent cylinder deactivation. Address the oil consumption issue if present. Replace fouled spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (for VCM disabler and spark plug replacement); $500 - $2000+ (for addressing oil consumption depending on the cause - valve stem seals, piston rings, etc.)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2018 Acura RDX owners have reported excessive oil consumption, which can lead to engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Symptoms include the need to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Perform an oil consumption test to determine the severity. Potential fixes include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ (depending on the cause and extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid change using genuine Acura ATF. If the problem persists, valve body issues may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change); $800 - $2000+ (valve body repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of struts/shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, decreased handling performance, and unusual noises (clunking or squeaking) over bumps.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected struts/shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per strut/shock replaced (including labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported unexplained battery drain issues, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Possible causes include faulty sensors, modules not shutting down properly, or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (for diagnostic testing); cost varies greatly depending on the cause of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve the issue. If not, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update); $500 - $1500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may be come noisy, operate slowly, or fail to close properly.
    *   Solution: Clean and lubricate the sunroof tracks and mechanism. In more severe cases, the sunroof motor or regulator may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (for cleaning and lubrication); $300 - $1000+ (for motor/regulator replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Errors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate GPS location, difficulty acquiring satellite signal, or outdated map data.
    *   Solution: Update the navigation system software and map data.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for map updates); more for hardware issues if needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2018 Acura RDX is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners have reported issues ranging from minor inconveniences to more significant mechanical problems. The most prevalent issues appear to be related to the engine (VCM misfires and oil consumption) and transmission (harsh shifting). Repair costs vary depending on the specific issue, but addressing engine and transmission problems can be expensive. While less common, electrical and sunroof issues also surface. Careful inspection and maintenance are recommended to mitigate potential problems.
