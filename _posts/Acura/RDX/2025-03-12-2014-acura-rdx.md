The 2014 Acura RDX is a compact luxury SUV that was praised for its reliability, comfortable ride, and responsive handling. The 2014 RDX came with only one engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 273 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the RDX for its fuel efficiency, smooth powertrain, and overall value. Some criticisms include the lack of advanced tech features compared to competitors and a somewhat bland interior design.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idle, spark plug fouling, and catalytic converter failure. The VCM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can sometimes cause issues due to uneven wear and oil buildup.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using an aftermarket device, or replace faulty VCM components (solenoids). Cleaning or replacing fouled spark plugs can provide temporary relief.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 for a VCM disabler. $500 - $1500+ for VCM system component replacement or engine repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level. Common leak areas include the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for valve cover gaskets. $200 - $500 for oil pan gasket. $500 - $1000+ for rear main seal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Control Solenoid Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, difficulty starting after refueling, rough idle, poor fuel economy. The purge control solenoid valve regulates the flow of fuel vapor from the fuel tank to the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty purge control solenoid valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200

    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush using Honda/Acura-specific ATF. In some cases, replacement of the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for a fluid flush. $3000 - $5000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at certain speeds, especially under light acceleration. Check engine light may illuminate with a torque converter-related code.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, the entire transmission may need to be replaced.

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll in corners, visible fluid leaks from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per corner (strut/shock replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is left sitting for a few days. Difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Identify and repair any parasitic drains (e.g., faulty door switch, aftermarket accessories drawing power when the car is off).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for battery replacement. $100 - $500+ to diagnose and repair parasitic drains.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Acura RDX is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported issues with the engine's VCM system leading to oil consumption, the transmission experiencing harsh shifting, and electrical problems like battery drain. Suspension components can also wear out over time. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, others, like transmission or dashboard replacement, can be costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any used 2014 Acura RDX before purchase. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
