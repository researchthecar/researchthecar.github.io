The 2016 Acura RDX is a compact luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 279 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate its user-friendly technology, smooth power delivery, and relatively affordable price point for a luxury vehicle. However, some common criticisms include the lack of a more modern transmission with additional gears for improved fuel economy, and the infotainment system's somewhat dated interface, though the 2016 model year addressed some of the initial complaints with the infotainment.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, and engine misfires. These issues are often linked to the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices or tuning. Addressing oil consumption may require piston ring replacement in severe cases. Fouled spark plugs should be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$2,000+ (depending on the severity and required repairs, from disabling VCM to replacing piston rings).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise coming from the engine, especially at startup. Can lead to catastrophic engine damage if the timing belt slips or breaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, tensioner, and water pump as a preventative measure, especially if the vehicle has high mileage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. Hesitation when shifting into gear, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid change using genuine Acura fluid. If the issue persists, a more thorough inspection of the valve body and solenoids may be necessary. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) to $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Shocks/Struts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bumpy or unstable ride, excessive bouncing after hitting bumps, and unusual tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the worn rear shocks/struts. Consider replacing them in pairs for balanced performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800 (for a pair of shocks/struts and installation)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains faster than expected, especially if the car sits for several days, possibly requiring jumpstarts.
    * Solution: Check for parasitic draws by testing the current draw with the car off and key out. Common causes include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or restarts unexpectedly.
    * Solution: Software updates may resolve some of these issues. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,000+ (unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Cracked Tail Light Lenses**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing in the tail light lenses, potentially allowing moisture to enter.
    * Solution: Replace the cracked tail light lens or the entire tail light assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$400 (per tail light)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof getting stuck, making unusual noises during operation, or failing to close properly.
    * Solution: Inspect the sunroof tracks and clean and lubricate them. If the issue persists, the sunroof motor or mechanism may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+ (depending on the repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Acura RDX generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but certain issues do surface more frequently. The VCM system's potential for oil consumption and the 6-speed automatic transmission's occasional harsh shifting are the most significant concerns in terms of potential cost and inconvenience. Electrical and suspension issues appear with less frequency but should still be considered when evaluating a used model. Overall, a thorough inspection and addressing any existing issues promptly are crucial to ensuring a positive ownership experience.
