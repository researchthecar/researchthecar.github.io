Transmission issues, mainly harsh shifting, are a nuisance and, if unresolved by software, become costly repairs. The infotainment glitches can be frustrating, and suspension issues on ADS-equipped models can impact ride quality. Creaking noises are an annoyance. Most of these issues range in severity, with costs that can go as high as $8,000 for a transmission replacement. Therefore, it's essential to have the vehicle thoroughly inspected, especially focusing on these areas, before purchasing.
