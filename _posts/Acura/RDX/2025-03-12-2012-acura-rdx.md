The 2012 Acura RDX marked a significant shift for the model, moving away from the turbocharged engine of the previous generation to a naturally aspirated 3.5L V6 engine. This engine produced 273 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque and was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the comfortable ride, responsive handling, and the Acura's reputation for reliability. However, some dislike the less sporty feel compared to the previous generation's turbocharged model and the somewhat dated technology compared to newer competitors. The switch to a naturally aspirated engine was generally viewed as a step backwards from some performance enthusiasts who preferred the more sporty and exciting engine from the previous generation.

**Engine**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idle, engine misfires, and illuminated check engine light. This often occurs due to fouling of spark plugs and piston rings in cylinders that are deactivated by the VCM system.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices, replace fouled spark plugs, or in severe cases, replace piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the severity and chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, difficulty starting after refueling, rough idle, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the purge valve.

    *   Solution: Replace the faulty struts/shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery dies overnight or after a short period of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the parasitic drain (often caused by a faulty component or wiring issue). Common culprits include the Bluetooth module or HandsFreeLink system.

**Summary**

The 2012 Acura RDX, while generally reliable, has some notable common issues. The engine's VCM system and transmission's torque converter are primary concerns, potentially leading to moderate to high repair costs. Electrical glitches with the navigation system and battery drain can also be frustrating. Suspension and interior issues are less common but should be considered. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and review maintenance records to assess the vehicle's overall condition. While no safety recalls were found, it is important to independently verify this information with the NHTSA website.
