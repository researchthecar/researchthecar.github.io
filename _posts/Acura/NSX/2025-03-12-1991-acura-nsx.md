Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 1991 Acura NSX, formatted for your website.

The 1991 Acura NSX is a mid-engine, two-seat sports car that was groundbreaking for its time. It was offered with a 3.0L V6 engine producing 270 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Buyers had a choice between a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The NSX was praised for its handling, innovative aluminum construction, and comfortable ride for a sports car. Criticisms often centered on the somewhat underwhelming power delivery compared to its competitors and the relatively high price point. Over time, common dislikes also revolve around the expense of maintenance and the age-related wear and tear on specific components.
