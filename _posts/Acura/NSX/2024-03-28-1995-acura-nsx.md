**Introduction**

The 1995 Acura NSX is a mid-engine sports car that was produced from 1990 to 2005. It was powered by a 3.0-liter V6 engine that produced 270 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. The NSX was available with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. It was praised for its handling and performance, but it was also criticized for its high price and limited production numbers.
