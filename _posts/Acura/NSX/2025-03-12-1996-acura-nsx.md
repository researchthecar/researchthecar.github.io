**Summary:**

The 1996 Acura NSX, while a highly regarded sports car, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine-related issues such as VTEC solenoid gasket leaks and distributor failures are relatively common. Transmission issues, especially synchro wear in the manual transmission and harsh shifting in the automatic, can be more costly to repair. Suspension and electrical issues are also prevalent, but often less severe and less expensive to address. The center console warping is a common cosmetic issue. The overall cost of addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major component replacements or overhauls.
