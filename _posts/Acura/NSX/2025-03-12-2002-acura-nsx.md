The 2002 Acura NSX is a mid-engine, two-seat sports car known for its handling, reliability, and exotic car looks. The 2002 NSX was only available with a 3.2L V6 engine producing 290 hp and 224 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic with Formula One-inspired paddle shifters. It's praised for its balanced chassis, communicative steering, and smooth engine. Some criticisms include the relatively low power output compared to other sports cars of the era and its dated interior design compared to more modern vehicles.
