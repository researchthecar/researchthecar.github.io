The 2005 Acura NSX is a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its exceptional handling, precise steering, and overall driving experience. It was only offered with one engine option, a 3.2L V6, and two transmission options: a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. The 3.2L V6 produced 290 horsepower and 224 lb-ft of torque in manual versions, and 252 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque in automatic versions. Owners often praise the NSX for its timeless design, balanced performance, and reliability for a sports car. Common dislikes can include the relatively low power output compared to modern sports cars and the cost of maintenance and repairs due to the car's age and specialized parts.
