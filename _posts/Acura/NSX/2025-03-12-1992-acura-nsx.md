The 1992 Acura NSX is a mid-engine, two-seat sports car that was revolutionary for its time, blending exotic car performance with Honda's renowned reliability and build quality. It came with a 3.0L V6 engine producing 270 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners love the car for its balanced handling, engaging driving experience, and timeless design. Common complaints often revolve around the age of the vehicle, leading to increased maintenance needs and potential difficulty in sourcing specific parts. The NSX is known for its comfortable ride for a sports car, and its relatively good reliability when compared to its exotic competitors. However, as with any car of this age, issues do arise.

**Summary**

The 1992 Acura NSX, while a highly desirable and well-engineered sports car, is prone to issues stemming from its age. Engine and transmission problems, particularly oil leaks, synchro wear, and automatic transmission slippage, can be costly to address. Suspension issues like worn dampers and bushings can affect handling and ride quality. Electrical problems such as main relay failures and gauge cluster issues can also arise. Exterior issues with headlight motors and door handles are also common. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs and maintenance to keep their NSX in top condition. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more significant, with costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars. Despite these potential issues, the NSX remains a rewarding car to own for those who appreciate its unique blend of performance, design, and Honda engineering.
