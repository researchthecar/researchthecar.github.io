**Introduction:**

The 1997 Acura NSX is a high-performance sports car powered by a 3.0L V6 engine producing 270 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, while a 4-speed automatic transmission was optional. The NSX is known for its exceptional handling, lightweight chassis, and striking wedge-shaped design. However, it is not without its potential issues.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6**

* **Variable Valve Timing Solenoid Failure:** Sticking or malfunctioning variable valve timing solenoids can cause rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and decreased engine performance. Replacement of the faulty solenoid is required. **$200-$400+**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A leaking intake manifold gasket can lead to vacuum leaks, causing rough idling, misfires, and loss of power. Replacement of the gasket and cleaning of the intake manifold is necessary. **$500-$1000+**
* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt, if not properly maintained or replaced according to the manufacturer's recommended intervals, can fail, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Preventive replacement of the timing belt, tensioner, and water pump is crucial. **$1200-$1800+**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Difficulty Shifting:** Worn or damaged synchros can make it difficult to shift gears smoothly, especially when cold. Replacement of the affected synchros is necessary. **$800-$1500+**
* **Clutch Engagement Issues:** A worn or misaligned clutch can cause slipping, chattering, or difficulty engaging gears. Replacement of the clutch assembly and resurfacing of the flywheel is typically required. **$1000-$1500+**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** A failing torque converter can cause vibrations while shifting or accelerating. Replacement of the torque converter and transmission fluid is necessary. **$2000-$3000+**
* **Shift Solenoid Malfunction:** Faulty shift solenoids can prevent gears from engaging properly, resulting in delays, hard shifts, or loss of gears. Replacement of the affected solenoid is required. **$300-$600+**

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Noises:** Worn or damaged front suspension components, such as ball joints or control arms, can produce clunking or rattling noises during driving. Replacement of the affected components is necessary. **$300-$700+**
* **Rear Suspension Sagging:** Worn rear suspension springs or shocks can cause the rear of the vehicle to sag, affecting handling and ride comfort. Replacement of the rear suspension components is required. **$400-$800+**
* **Alignment Issues:** Improper alignment can cause uneven tire wear, reduced handling, and steering instability. Professional alignment is required to correct the alignment. **$100-$200+**

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** A failing alternator can cause electrical system malfunctions, battery discharge, and difficulty starting the vehicle. Replacement of the alternator is required. **$500-$1000+**
* **Starter Motor Failure:** A faulty starter motor can prevent the engine from starting. Replacement of the starter motor is necessary. **$300-$600+**
* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic battery drain can cause the battery to discharge prematurely, especially when the vehicle is parked for extended periods. Diagnosis and repair of the source of the drain is required. **Varies depending on the cause**

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Leaks:** Faulty weatherstripping or drainage tubes can allow water to leak into the passenger compartment through the sunroof. Replacement or repair of the affected components is necessary. **$300-$600+**
* **Windshield Seal Failure:** The windshield seal can deteriorate over time, allowing water or air to enter the vehicle. Replacement of the windshield and resealing is required. **$400-$800+**
* **Clear Coat Peeling:** In certain model years, the clear coat on the paint can peel or discolor due to exposure to sunlight or harsh chemicals. Professional repaint or clear coat application is required. **$1000-$2500+**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking:** In some cases, the dashboard can develop cracks or warpage due to repeated exposure to heat or sunlight. Replacement of the dashboard is necessary. **$1500-$2500+**
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Faulty sensors or actuators in the climate control system can result in improper air temperature or airflow. Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the affected components is required. **$300-$800+**
* **Cruise Control Intermittent:** Malfunctioning switches or sensors in the cruise control system can cause it to operate intermittently or not at all. Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the affected components is required. **$200-$400+**

**Summary:**

While the Acura NSX is a highly regarded sports car, it can experience various issues with its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical components, and body. The severity and cost of these issues vary depending on the specific problem encountered. Owners should be aware of potential issues and maintain their vehicles regularly to minimize the risk of costly repairs.
