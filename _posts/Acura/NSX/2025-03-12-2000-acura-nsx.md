**Summary**

The 2000 Acura NSX, while a well-engineered sports car, is now over two decades old. Common issues revolve around age-related degradation of rubber components (seals, bushings), electrical components, and wear and tear on drivetrain parts. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission work or suspension overhauls, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the car and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a mechanic familiar with NSXs. While the NSX is known for its reliability, maintenance and repair costs can be higher than typical cars due to its exotic nature and specialized parts.
