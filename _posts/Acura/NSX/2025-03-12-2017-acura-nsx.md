**Summary:**

The 2017 Acura NSX, while a technological marvel, has some reported issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns relate to the electric motor and battery system, which can be costly to repair. Electrical glitches and sensor malfunctions can also be frustrating. While some exterior and interior issues exist, they are generally less severe.
