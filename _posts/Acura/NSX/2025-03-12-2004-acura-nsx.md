The 2004 Acura NSX is a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its exotic styling, balanced handling, and reliable performance. For 2004, it was available with a single engine and transmission configuration: a 3.2-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 224 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the NSX for its engaging driving experience, comfortable interior (for a sports car), and timeless design. Criticisms typically focus on its relatively modest power output compared to modern sports cars and its age, leading to potentially higher maintenance costs and difficulty sourcing parts.

**Summary**

The 2004 Acura NSX is a generally reliable vehicle, but as with any older car, it is susceptible to age-related issues. The most common issues revolve around oil leaks, clutch components, suspension bushings, and electrical problems. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or ABS module replacements, can be costly. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic experienced with NSXs to identify any existing or potential problems. Despite these potential issues, the NSX remains a desirable sports car that, when properly maintained, offers a rewarding driving experience.
