The 2018 Acura NSX is a mid-engine hybrid sports car that combines performance with technology. It features a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with a nine-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) and a three-motor hybrid system. The powertrain delivers a combined output of 573 horsepower and 476 lb-ft of torque. People generally like the NSX for its advanced hybrid technology, sharp handling, and supercar styling. Some common criticisms include its high price point, complex powertrain leading to potential maintenance concerns, and the relatively small cargo space.

**Electric Motor**

**Three-Motor Hybrid System**

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported reduced electric range and overall battery performance over time, especially in hot climates or with frequent use of the electric drive mode. This manifests as the car relying more heavily on the gasoline engine.
    *   Solution: The hybrid battery may need to be reconditioned or replaced. Dealership diagnostics can determine the extent of degradation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $15,000+ (depending on reconditioning vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**3.5L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported oil leaks, particularly around the valve cover gaskets or turbocharger lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets or turbocharger oil lines. Thoroughly cleaning the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the source and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of fuel injector failures have surfaced, leading to misfires, rough idling, and reduced performance. Diagnostic codes may indicate specific cylinder misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s) and potentially cleaning the fuel system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on how many injectors need replacing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have described instances of rough or jerky shifting, especially at lower speeds. Some report hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and adaptation reset may alleviate some symptoms. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission overhaul may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush and reset) to $5,000+ (transmission overhaul)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the nature of dual-clutch transmissions, clutch wear is inevitable. Aggressive driving habits can accelerate wear. Symptoms include slippage, difficulty engaging gears, and unusual noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset. In some cases, software updates from Acura can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) to $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Delamination of Carbon Fiber Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some NSX vehicles equipped with the optional carbon fiber exterior package have experienced delamination issues with these panels. This is where the clear coat begins to peel and flake off of the Carbon Fiber panels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected carbon fiber panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $10,000+ (depending on the panel and if it is OEM or aftermarket)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rattling noises from the interior, specifically from the dashboard area or door panels, while driving on uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and applying sound dampening materials. Tightening loose panels or components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on complexity of repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Acura NSX, while a technologically advanced and high-performing vehicle, has some common issues to be aware of. Potential problems range from relatively minor infotainment glitches and interior rattles to more significant concerns like engine oil leaks, transmission issues, and hybrid battery degradation. The cost of repairs can vary widely, with some issues requiring relatively inexpensive fixes, while others may lead to substantial expenses. Due to the complexity of the powertrain, it is very important to have a qualified technician to work on the vehicle. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic experienced with hybrid vehicles and dual-clutch transmissions.
