The 2003 Acura NSX is a mid-engine, two-seat sports car renowned for its precise handling, balanced performance, and sophisticated design. The 2003 NSX was only offered with one engine: a 3.2-liter V6 producing 290 horsepower and 224 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. The NSX is praised for its exotic car feel with Honda reliability, its comfortable cabin, and its timeless styling. Common complaints revolve around the cost of maintenance and parts, which can be high due to the car's rarity and specialized components, as well as its relatively dated technology compared to modern sports cars.

**Engine**

*   **Snap Oversteer**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden, uncontrollable loss of rear traction, especially in wet or slippery conditions, requiring immediate driver correction. This is not necessarily a mechanical issue but rather a handling characteristic due to the car's mid-engine layout and suspension setup.
    *   Solution: Driver training and familiarization with the car's handling dynamics; potentially upgrading suspension components or tires.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on upgrades chosen
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop over time, particularly from valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the location of the leak and labor involved.

**Summary**

The 2003 Acura NSX, while a highly desirable sports car, is subject to age-related issues common in vehicles of its vintage. These problems range from relatively minor electrical or interior cosmetic issues to more significant mechanical concerns with the engine, transmission, and suspension. The severity of these issues can vary, but the cost to fix can be substantial due to the specialized nature of the NSX and the rarity of its parts. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with NSXs to assess the vehicle's condition and potential repair needs.
