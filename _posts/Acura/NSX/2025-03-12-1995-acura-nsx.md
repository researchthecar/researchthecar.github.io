**Summary**

The 1995 Acura NSX, while a highly desirable sports car, is not immune to common issues associated with vehicles of its age. Engine oil leaks and distributor issues are common maintenance points for the engine. Clutch and Synchro wear are often seen in the 5-speed manual transmissions, while the 4-speed automatic can have delayed or harsh shifting. Electrical issues, particularly with the headlight motors and gauge cluster, are also frequent. The severity of these issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing gaskets or bushings to more costly repairs such as transmission rebuilds or replacements. Buyers should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs compared to more modern vehicles.
