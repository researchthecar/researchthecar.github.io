The 1998 Acura EL was a compact sedan based on the Honda Civic, specifically designed for the Canadian market. It offered a more luxurious and refined experience compared to its Civic counterpart. It came with only one engine option: a 1.6-liter SOHC 4-cylinder VTEC engine producing around 127 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. This engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the EL for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling and lack of performance compared to other Acura models.
