The 2001 Acura EL is a compact sedan based on the Honda Civic platform, offering a more luxurious and refined experience compared to its Honda counterpart. The Acura EL came with only one engine option: the 1.7L SOHC VTEC inline-4 D17A2 engine, which produced 127 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the EL's reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Common complaints often revolve around its age, leading to issues with aging components and difficulty finding specific parts. Some find the engine underpowered, particularly when fully loaded or driving uphill.
