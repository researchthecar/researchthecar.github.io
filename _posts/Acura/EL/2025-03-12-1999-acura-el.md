The 1999 Acura EL was a compact sedan exclusive to the Canadian market, based on the Honda Civic platform. It offered a more luxurious experience than the Civic, with upgraded interior materials and styling. The sole engine option was a 1.6-liter inline-4 SOHC VTEC engine, producing approximately 127 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the EL's fuel efficiency, reliability, and comfortable ride. However, some disliked its limited power, particularly when fully loaded, and its availability only in Canada.
