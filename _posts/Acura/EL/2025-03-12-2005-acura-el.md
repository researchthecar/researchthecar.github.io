The 2005 Acura EL is a compact sedan based on the Honda Civic. It was only available in Canada. It features a 1.7-liter SOHC VTEC inline-4 engine (D17A2) producing 127 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the EL's reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints revolve around its relatively basic interior compared to other luxury brands, and the styling being almost identical to the Civic.

Engine-related problems often involve the catalytic converter and oxygen sensors, while transmission issues primarily affect the automatic variant. Suspension problems often involve worn bushings. Electrical issues with power windows and door locks can occur. Rust on the rear quarter panels is a common concern. Most repairs are moderately priced, but major engine or transmission work can be more costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
