The 2003 Acura EL is a compact sedan based on the Honda Civic. It was only sold in Canada. This model year came with a single engine option, the 1.7L SOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine producing 127 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the EL for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride, but some find the styling bland and the performance adequate but not exciting. The lack of features compared to similarly priced competitors is also a common complaint.

**Engine**

**Summary:**

The 2003 Acura EL is generally considered a reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it's prone to certain issues. The most common issues relate to engine maintenance (catalytic converter, oxygen sensors, gasket leaks), transmission performance (especially delayed shifting), suspension wear (bushings, struts), and electrical problems (window motors, battery drain). Rust is also a concern, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue and the severity of the problem, but overall, the EL is relatively affordable to maintain compared to some other vehicles in its class. A thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2003 Acura EL, paying close attention to the areas mentioned above.
