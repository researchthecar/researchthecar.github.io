The 2002 Acura EL is a compact sedan based on the Honda Civic platform, offering a more luxurious experience than its Honda counterpart. It came exclusively with a 1.7-liter inline-4 engine, producing approximately 127 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the EL's reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride, while some criticize its somewhat bland styling and lack of performance compared to other Acura models.
