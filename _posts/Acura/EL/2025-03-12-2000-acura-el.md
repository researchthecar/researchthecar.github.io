The 2000 Acura EL is a compact sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. It's essentially a rebadged Honda Civic, offering a slightly more upscale feel. The 2000 Acura EL came with a single engine option: a 1.6L SOHC 4-cylinder VTEC engine, producing 127 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the EL's fuel economy, responsive handling, and comfortable interior for its class. Common complaints revolve around the vehicle's age, leading to issues related to wear and tear on various components, as well as some specific issues with certain systems.

**Engine**

**1.6L SOHC 4-Cylinder VTEC (D16Y8)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from the valve cover gasket, distributor o-ring, or oil pan gasket. These leaks can be identified by the smell of burning oil, visible oil on the engine, or low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected gasket or o-ring. Ensure surfaces are clean before installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Distributor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, stalling, or failure to start. Can be caused by a faulty ignition control module (ICM) or a failing distributor cap/rotor.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty distributor components (cap, rotor, ICM) or the entire distributor assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting between gears, delayed engagement, or jerky/harsh shifts. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, low transmission fluid, or a faulty solenoid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be needed to determine if internal components are worn and require replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid flush/filter); $1500 - $3000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially over bumps. Reduced handling precision and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn bushings in control arms, sway bar links, and strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per corner, depending on the specific bushings and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts/shocks. Recommended to replace in pairs (both front or both rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per pair, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window fails to move up or down, or moves intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, battery warning light, difficulty starting the engine, or complete electrical failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around wheel wells, rocker panels, and other areas prone to moisture accumulation. Common in areas with harsh winters and road salt use.
    *   Solution: Repair rust by sanding, patching, and repainting. Severe rust may require replacement of entire body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the rust damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking and splitting of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2000 Acura EL, while generally reliable, exhibits common issues related to its age. Oil leaks, distributor issues, and transmission slipping are potential engine and transmission concerns. Suspension bushings and struts wear over time, leading to ride and handling issues. Electrical problems such as power window motor failure and alternator failure are also common. Rust can be a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh weather conditions. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and value. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive (gaskets, bushings), others (transmission rebuild, rust repair) can be more costly.
