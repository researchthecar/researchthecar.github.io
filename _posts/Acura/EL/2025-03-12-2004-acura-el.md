The 2004 Acura EL is a compact luxury sedan based on the Honda Civic platform, offering a more upscale experience with added features and styling enhancements. It came equipped with a single engine option: a 1.7-liter inline-4 VTEC engine producing 127 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the EL for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes often include its somewhat dated styling compared to newer vehicles and the limited availability of high-tech features. Some also find the engine performance adequate but not particularly exciting.

**Summary**

The 2004 Acura EL, while generally reliable, can experience issues common to vehicles of its age. Engine-related oil consumption and catalytic converter failure are the most serious issues, but electrical and suspension problems, while not uncommon, are typically less expensive to address.

Rust can also be a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh weather.
