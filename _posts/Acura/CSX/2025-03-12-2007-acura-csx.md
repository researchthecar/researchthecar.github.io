The 2007 Acura CSX is a compact sedan sold in Canada, essentially a rebadged Honda Civic with more premium features and styling. It came with a single engine option: a 2.0L i-VTEC inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the CSX for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include the somewhat plain interior styling (considering it's an Acura) and the lack of certain advanced features available on some competitors.
