The 2009 Acura CSX is a compact sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and upscale features compared to its Honda Civic counterpart. It was primarily sold in the Canadian market. The standard engine option is a 2.0-liter inline-4 i-VTEC engine producing approximately 155 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. A major selling point of the CSX was its blend of Honda's renowned reliability with Acura's luxury appointments. However, some owners have reported issues related to specific components as the vehicle ages. Some common complaints include issues with the climate control system and premature suspension wear.
