The 2006 Acura CSX was a Canadian-market compact sedan based on the Honda Civic. It offered a more luxurious experience than the Civic, with features like leather seats and upgraded interior trim. The sole engine option was a 2.0L i-VTEC inline-4 cylinder engine, which produced 155 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. People often liked the CSX for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride, but some disliked its relatively plain styling compared to other Acura models and potential rust issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L i-VTEC Inline-4 (K20Z2)**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking from the engine, often near the water pump or hoses. This can lead to overheating if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking water pump, hoses, or clamps. Sometimes the radiator itself can be the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source and if any damage to the engine has occurred.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Adjustment Needed**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, rough idle, decreased fuel economy, and possible stalling. This is caused by valves being out of adjustment due to normal wear.
    *   Solution: Perform a valve adjustment according to Acura's specifications.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ depending on the shop's labor rate.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay when shifting between gears, harsh or jerky shifts, and potential slipping. Could be due to worn transmission fluid, valve body issues, or worn clutches.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush (using Honda/Acura ATF-Z1 or DW-1 fluid). If that doesn't resolve the issue, further diagnosis and repair may be needed, potentially including valve body repair/replacement or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for a fluid flush, $500 - $1500+ for valve body work or transmission rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Grinding during Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noise when shifting into certain gears (often 2nd or 3rd), difficulty engaging gears. Could be due to worn synchronizers or a worn clutch.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch assembly or repair/replace the affected synchronizers within the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the rear suspension, especially over bumps. Unstable handling. Visual inspection will reveal cracked and worn bushings.
    * Solution: Replace the rear trailing arm bushings. It's often recommended to replace both sides at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on if you replace the entire arm or just the bushing and the labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and potentially leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the brand of replacement parts and labor.
