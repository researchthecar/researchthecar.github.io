The 2010 Acura CSX is a compact sedan exclusively sold in Canada. It is essentially a rebadged Honda Civic with more luxurious features and styling. The 2010 CSX came with one engine option: a 2.0L i-VTEC inline-4, producing 155 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the CSX for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and comfortable ride. Common complaints revolve around its dated interior design compared to newer models and the availability of parts/service being limited due to it being exclusive to the Canadian market.
