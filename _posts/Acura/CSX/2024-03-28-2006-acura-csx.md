## 2006 Acura CSX

The 2006 Acura CSX is a compact luxury sedan that was produced by Honda for the North American market. It was based on the Honda Civic platform and was available with a choice of two engines: a 2.0-liter inline-four or a 2.4-liter inline-five. Both engines were mated to a five-speed automatic transmission.
