The 2011 Acura CSX is a compact sedan sold exclusively in Canada. It's essentially a rebadged ninth-generation Honda Civic, but with a more luxurious interior and some unique styling cues. The 2011 CSX came with only one engine option: a 2.0-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine (K20Z2) producing 155 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the CSX for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable interior, but some find the styling to be bland and the performance to be adequate but not exciting.

Suspension and minor electrical issues are also present, but are generally less expensive to address. While most of the problems are not severe, it is important to inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing, paying close attention to the transmission's operation and any signs of rust.
