The 2012 Acura TSX is a popular entry-level luxury sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and sporty handling. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 201 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 producing 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was offered with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission, while the V6 came exclusively with a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the TSX for its fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.4L engine), smooth ride, and upscale interior. Some common complaints include the somewhat bland styling (especially compared to the competition) and the lack of some modern features that were becoming more common in other luxury vehicles of the time.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This is not as widespread as some other vehicles but is still present. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil frequently.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is crucial. Some owners have had success with using a heavier weight oil, although this is not a guaranteed fix and may have other consequences. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (Piston Ring Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the timing chain tensioner can lead to a rattling noise, especially on cold starts. If left unaddressed, it can potentially cause timing chain skipping and significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and, if necessary, the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The V6 engine uses Honda's VCM system to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders during light load conditions. This system can sometimes cause vibrations, rough idling, and increased oil consumption. Some owners have also reported spark plug fouling on the deactivated cylinders.
    *   Solution: Disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices (VCM Tuner II, S-VCM) has been a popular solution for owners experiencing these issues. This prevents the engine from switching to 3-cylinder mode. Some owners also report that using a higher-quality synthetic oil can help reduce oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (VCM Disabling Device)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (2.4L and 3.5L)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported delayed or harsh shifting, particularly when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear or when downshifting. This can be caused by worn transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush using genuine Honda/Acura ATF-Z1 fluid (now superseded by ATF DW-1). If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required to check for solenoid issues or internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Fluid Flush), $300 - $800+ (Solenoid Replacement), $2,000 - $4,000+ (Transmission Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises coming from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. This is often attributed to worn strut mounts.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front strut mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (for both sides)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation or infotainment screen can experience flickering, dimming, or complete failure. This is more common on vehicles with the Technology Package.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the screen or the associated control module is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may stop working intermittently or completely, requiring manual locking and unlocking of doors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation can accumulate inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs.
    *   Solution: Some owners have attempted to dry out the headlights using a hairdryer or by removing the bulbs and letting them air dry. In severe cases, replacement of the headlight housings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per headlight (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, make unusual noises, or leak. This can be caused by debris in the tracks, a faulty motor, or worn seals.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the motor or seals may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2012 Acura TSX is generally a reliable vehicle, but certain issues can arise, particularly with higher mileage examples. Engine-related problems like oil consumption and VCM issues are present but not extremely prevalent. Transmission problems and electrical issues are also common. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the repair shop. Addressing these issues promptly can help prevent more significant problems down the road and maintain the vehicle's value.
