The 2007 Acura TSX is a popular sport sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and well-appointed interior. It came standard with a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine (K24A2) producing 200 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. People appreciate the TSX for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and Acura's reputation for dependability. Common complaints include some minor electrical issues and the age-related wear and tear expected of a vehicle from this era.

**Engine**

**2.4L K24A2 Inline-4**

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle (Cold Start)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start that lasts for a few seconds. This is typically caused by the Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator losing oil pressure overnight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VTC actuator with an updated part (if available), or replacing the entire camshaft assembly. Honda/Acura released updated VTC actuators to address this issue in later models, but installing it on a 2007 model may still be beneficial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption (High Mileage)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2007 TSX owners have reported increased oil consumption as the vehicle ages and accumulates higher mileage (over 150,000 miles).
    *   Solution: Addressing potential causes like worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A leak-down test can help determine the source of the oil consumption. Depending on the results, solutions could include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Drive Belt Tensioner**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The drive belt tensioner can fail causing squealing noises or complete drive belt failure, leading to loss of power steering and charging.
    *   Solution: Replace the drive belt tensioner and inspect the drive belt for any damage and replace as necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear, especially at higher mileages.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with genuine Honda/Acura ATF-Z1 or DW-1 fluid may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the transmission valve body or solenoids may need to be replaced or rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 (fluid flush), $500 - $1500+ (valve body/solenoid replacement or rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Creaking or clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when turning the steering wheel at low speeds or going over bumps. This is often due to worn strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially over bumps. Could be caused by any number of worn suspension bushings, including the compliance bushings in the lower control arms.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings and inspect ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the location and number of bushings to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks on one or more doors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may not open or close correctly. It could be due to a faulty motor, switch, or track.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sunroof track and motor. Replace any faulty parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio Display Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dim or unreadable radio display, especially in hot weather.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with replacing capacitors on the circuit board of the radio display. In other cases, the entire radio unit needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (capacitor replacement, DIY), $200 - $500+ (radio unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Acura TSX is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it can experience certain issues. Engine issues such as the VTC actuator rattle and oil consumption, as well as transmission issues like delayed shifting in the automatic transmission, are the most concerning and costly. Suspension noises and electrical glitches are also common. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, others, like rust repair or transmission rebuilds, can be quite costly. Buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the overall condition of the vehicle and identify any potential problems.
