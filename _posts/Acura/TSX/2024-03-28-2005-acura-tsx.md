**Introduction:**

The 2005 Acura TSX is a compact sports sedan known for its sleek design, responsive handling, and premium interior. It is powered by one engine option, a 2.4-liter inline-four that produces 200 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. The TSX is available with either a 5-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission. Drivers appreciate its agile performance, comfortable and well-equipped cabin, but criticize its limited rear-seat space and firm ride quality.

## **Engine**

**2.4-Liter Inline-Four**

- **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption, leading to smoking from the exhaust and potential engine damage. Requires engine rebuild or replacement. $2,000+
- **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Loose timing chain tensioner causes rattling noises, reduced engine power, and potential catastrophic engine failure. Requires timing chain and tensioner replacement. $600 - $1,000
- **Intake Manifold Runner Control Sensor Failure:** Faulty sensor disrupts intake manifold operation, reducing engine power and causing rough running. Requires sensor replacement. $200 - $400+
- **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves:** Accumulation of carbon on intake valves hinders valve movement, leading to reduced engine performance and fuel economy. Requires manual cleaning or use of chemical cleaner. $300 - $600+

## **Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission:**

- **Solenoid Failure:** Faulty solenoids prevent proper gear shifting, causing slipping or shuddering. Requires solenoid replacement. $400 - $800+
- **Torque Converter Lockup Clutch Failure:** Worn clutch slips, causing shuddering during acceleration or at highway speeds. Requires torque converter replacement. $1,200 - $2,000+

**6-Speed Manual Transmission:**

No Issues Found

## **Suspension**

- **Front Control Arm Bushings Failure:** Worn bushings result in rattling noises, reduced handling, and uneven tire wear. Requires control arm or bushing replacement. $500 - $800+
- **Rear Shock Absorbers Failure:** Worn shocks cause excessive bounce and poor ride quality. Requires shock absorber replacement. $400 - $600+
- **Rear Sway Bar End Links Failure:** Weak or damaged end links lead to excessive body roll and knocking noises. Requires end link replacement. $200 - $400+

## **Electrical**

- **Ignition Switch Failure:** Faulty switch prevents the vehicle from starting or turning off. Requires ignition switch replacement. $300 - $500+
- **Battery Drain:** Battery drains prematurely due to parasitic electrical draw. Requires diagnosis and repair of faulty component. $200 - $600+
- **HID Headlight Ballast Failure:** Defective ballast causes flickering or inoperable HID headlights. Requires ballast replacement. $400 - $800+

## **Exterior**

No Issues Found

## **Interior**

- **Climate Control Panel Failure:** Malfunctioning panel results in erratic temperature control or lack of air conditioning. Requires panel or digital display replacement. $500 - $800+
- **Dashboard Cracking:** Over time, the dashboard surface may develop cracks. Requires dashboard replacement or repair. $1,000+

## **Summary**

The 2005 Acura TSX generally has a good reliability rating, but it is not without its issues. Potential engine concerns, such as oil consumption and timing chain problems, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues are somewhat common, especially with the automatic transmission. Suspension components may wear out prematurely, affecting handling and ride quality. While electrical problems are not widespread, they can be frustrating and expensive to fix. Overall, the severity of the issues is moderate, and repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.
