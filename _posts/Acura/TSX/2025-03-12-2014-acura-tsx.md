The 2014 Acura TSX is a well-regarded compact executive car known for its reliability, sporty handling, and upscale features. It came standard with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 201 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. A 3.5-liter V6 engine, rated at 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, was also available. The 2.4L engine was paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission, while the V6 was only available with a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the TSX for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.4L), and Acura's reputation for build quality. However, some criticisms include the somewhat dated technology compared to newer competitors, and the lack of a more modern automatic transmission with more gears.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. The exact cause can vary, but it's often attributed to worn piston rings or valve stem seals. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and the need to frequently top off the oil.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help pinpoint the source. Depending on the severity, the fix can range from replacing valve stem seals to a complete engine rebuild or replacement of the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A small number of owners have experienced premature failure of the timing chain tensioner. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on cold starts. If left unaddressed, this can lead to timing chain slippage and potentially catastrophic engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, timing chain, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from the valve cover gaskets as they age and become brittle. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (2.4L and 3.5L)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the torque converter, which can cause hesitation, shuddering during acceleration, or rough shifting.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement, or in some cases, a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Front strut mounts can become worn and develop excessive play, resulting in clunking or rattling noises, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (for both front struts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight or within a few days of being parked. The cause can vary, but common culprits include a faulty alternator, parasitic draw from an aftermarket accessory, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the drain and repair or replace the affected component. This can involve testing the alternator, checking for parasitic draws, or replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation or infotainment system can experience glitches, freezes, or failure to boot up. This may be caused by a software glitch or hardware failure.
    * Solution: Try resetting the system or updating the software. If that doesn't work, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof motor can fail, preventing the sunroof from opening or closing.  The sunroof track can also become misaligned, causing the sunroof to bind.
    *   Solution: Replace the sunroof motor or repair/realign the sunroof track.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation that can reduce headlight effectiveness and potentially damage the bulbs or electrical components. This is often caused by a cracked housing or a faulty seal.
    *   Solution:  Reseal the headlight housing, replace the seals, or replace the entire headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Acura TSX, while generally reliable, does have some potential issues to be aware of. The 2.4L engine can experience oil consumption and timing chain tensioner problems, while the V6 can have oil leaks. Transmission issues, suspension noise, electrical problems, and sunroof malfunctions can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely. Potential buyers should have a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used TSX, paying particular attention to signs of oil consumption, engine noises, and transmission performance. The navigation system should be checked for any possible issues, as well.
