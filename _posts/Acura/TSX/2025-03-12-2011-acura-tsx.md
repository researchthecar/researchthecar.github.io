**Summary**

The 2011 Acura TSX is a generally reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues to be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the 2.4L engine's potential for excessive oil consumption and VTC actuator rattle, and the 5-speed automatic transmission's shifting problems.
