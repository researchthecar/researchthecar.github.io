The 2005 Acura TSX is a sporty and well-regarded entry-level luxury sedan. It was only offered with one engine option, the 2.4L K24A2 inline-4 cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. The TSX came standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, but a 5-speed automatic transmission was also available. Owners often praise the TSX for its reliability, sporty handling, comfortable interior, and overall value. Common complaints include the relatively firm ride, some interior trim rattles, and occasional electronic gremlins.
