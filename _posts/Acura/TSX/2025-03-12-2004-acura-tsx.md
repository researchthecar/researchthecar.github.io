The 2004 Acura TSX is a popular entry-level luxury sedan known for its sporty handling, reliable engine, and comfortable interior. It came exclusively with a 2.4L inline-4 i-VTEC engine producing 200 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the TSX for its engaging driving experience, build quality, and relatively good fuel economy. Common criticisms include the firm ride (especially on rough roads), some interior materials feeling less than luxurious, and the relatively small rear seat.

**Engine**

**2.4L K24A2 Inline-4 i-VTEC**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, especially as the engine ages. This can manifest as needing to add oil between regular oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: In some cases, using a thicker oil can help reduce consumption. More severe cases may require replacing piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start-up, usually lasting for a few seconds. This is often caused by the Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator failing to properly lock.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VTC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. In some cases, the transmission may slip or fail to engage gears properly.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may temporarily alleviate the issue. However, more severe cases may require a transmission rebuild or replacement. The transmission oil pressure switches are also known to fail on higher mileage cars causing rough shifts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) / $2,000 - $4,000 (rebuild or replacement) / $100-$300 for pressure switches
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Acura TSX is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil consumption, VTC actuator rattle, and potential transmission problems with the automatic transmission. Suspension components like strut mounts and trailing arm bushings can also wear out over time. Electrical issues, particularly with power windows, and interior problems like dashboard cracking and navigation screen failures (if equipped) can also occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to more costly repairs. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
