The 2009 Acura TSX is a popular compact executive car known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and sporty handling. It came standard with a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 201 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the TSX for its fuel efficiency, refined interior, and Acura's reputation for quality. However, some common complaints include a somewhat firm suspension, limited rear passenger space, and the lack of some advanced features found in newer vehicles.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil light illuminating or noticeable oil level drops on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may address the issue, but it is important to diagnose other potential causes of oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle at Startup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise at startup, particularly in cold weather, can indicate an issue with the Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VTC actuator is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear, or slipping during acceleration. This can be caused by worn clutch packs or solenoid issues within the transmission.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change might temporarily alleviate the issue, but a more permanent fix may involve rebuilding or replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $400 for a fluid change, $2000 - $4000+ for a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of struts or shock absorbers can lead to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over bumps. Noises such as clunking or squeaking coming from the suspension can also indicate worn components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty struts or shocks is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per strut/shock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises when going over bumps, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per control arm depending on whether only the bushings are replaced or the entire assembly.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate smoothly, become slow, or stop working altogether. This is often due to a faulty window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window regulator is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation System/Radio Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the navigation system freezing, malfunctioning, or the radio failing to function properly.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a software update can fix the issue. In other cases, replacing the unit is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100+ for software update (if available); $500 - $1500+ for replacement, depending on the unit.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can build up inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation and reduced visibility.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlight assembly, drying it out, and resealing the housing can help. In some cases, replacing the headlight assembly is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 for resealing; $300 - $800+ for replacement per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, fail to open or close properly, or make unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the sunroof tracks and mechanism can sometimes resolve the issue. More extensive repairs may involve replacing the sunroof motor or other components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 for lubrication; $200 - $800+ for repairs/replacement of parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Acura TSX is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues exist. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and VTC actuator rattle can be moderately expensive to address. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic transmission, can range from relatively inexpensive fluid changes to costly rebuilds or replacements. Suspension issues and electrical problems like power window regulators and navigation system malfunctions can also contribute to the overall cost of ownership. While the issues are not necessarily widespread, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
