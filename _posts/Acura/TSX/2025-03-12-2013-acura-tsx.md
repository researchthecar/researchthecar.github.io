The 2013 Acura TSX is a popular choice for those seeking a reliable and refined compact sedan. It offers a blend of sporty handling, a comfortable interior, and Acura's reputation for dependability. The 2013 TSX came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 201 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was available with either a 5-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission, while the V6 was paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the TSX for its fuel efficiency, responsive handling, and comfortable ride. Common dislikes often include the somewhat dated infotainment system, and for some, the less powerful 2.4L engine might feel underpowered compared to other options in its class.
