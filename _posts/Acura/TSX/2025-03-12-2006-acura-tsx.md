The 2006 Acura TSX is a popular sport sedan known for its reliability, sporty handling, and upscale features. It came standard with a 2.4L inline-4 engine (K24A2) producing 200 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the TSX for its fuel efficiency, comfortable interior, and engaging driving experience. However, some common complaints include issues with the navigation system, certain electrical components, and premature wear of some suspension components.

**Summary**

The 2006 Acura TSX is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of common issues. The most frequently reported problems involve the engine (VTEC solenoid leak, timing chain tensioner failure), the transmission (delayed shifting), and the suspension (rear compliance bushings, strut mount noise). Electrical issues with the navigation system and power windows are also common. While most of these issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to repair, some, like timing chain tensioner failure or transmission problems, can be costly if left unaddressed. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a mechanic inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
