Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2010 Acura TSX, formatted for your website's needs.

The 2010 Acura TSX is a popular entry-level luxury sedan known for its reliability, sporty handling, and upscale features. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 201 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L came standard with a 5-speed automatic transmission, with a 6-speed manual available as an option. The 3.5L V6 was exclusively paired with a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the TSX's fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.4L), comfortable interior, and Acura's reputation for dependability. Common complaints include a somewhat firm ride, less engaging styling compared to some competitors, and the 5-speed automatic feeling dated compared to newer transmissions on the market at the time.

**Summary**

The 2010 Acura TSX is generally a reliable vehicle, but it's important to be aware of potential issues, particularly the oil consumption issue in the 2.4L engine and potential transmission problems in the automatic. Electrical issues and suspension wear are also common as the vehicle ages.

A pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic is recommended.
