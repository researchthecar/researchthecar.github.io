The 1997 Acura SLX, a rebadged Isuzu Trooper, was offered with a single engine and transmission option: a 3.2-liter V6 engine producing 177 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. While the SLX offered a more luxurious interior than its Isuzu counterpart, many disliked its poor fuel economy, sluggish acceleration, and handling compared to other SUVs. People often appreciated its off-road capability and reliability, but some were turned off by its perceived lack of value considering the price.
