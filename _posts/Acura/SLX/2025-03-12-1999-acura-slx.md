The 1999 Acura SLX is a rebadged Isuzu Trooper, a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities. The SLX came with a single engine option, the 3.5L V6 producing 215 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, and was available with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the SLX for its ruggedness and reliability.
