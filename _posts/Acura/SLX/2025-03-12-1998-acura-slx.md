The 1998 Acura SLX is a rebadged Isuzu Trooper, a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and truck-based construction. It came with a single engine option, a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produced 230 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the SLX for its ruggedness, off-road prowess, and comfortable interior. However, common complaints included poor fuel economy, a somewhat dated design, and reliability issues inherited from the Isuzu Trooper.

The most significant problems revolve around the engine (oil leaks, timing belt) and transmission (harsh shifting). Suspension and electrical problems are also common.
