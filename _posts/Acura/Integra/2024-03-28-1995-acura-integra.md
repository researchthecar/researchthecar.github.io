**1995 Acura Integra**

The 1995 Acura Integra is a compact sports coupe that offers a blend of performance, handling, and affordability. It was available with two engine options: a 1.8-liter inline-four producing 140 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8-liter VTEC inline-four producing 170 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

People like the Integra for its sharp handling, responsive steering, and relatively low cost to own. However, it has been criticized for its lack of rear seat space and trunk capacity.
