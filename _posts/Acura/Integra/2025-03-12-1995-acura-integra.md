**Engine**

**1.8L DOHC Inline-4 B18B1 (LS, RS, GS)**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, rear main seal, and distributor o-ring. Symptoms include oil spots on the ground, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. In some cases, resealing the distributor or oil pan might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the location of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Distributor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, stalling, or a no-start condition. Often caused by a failing internal ignition coil or ignition control module.
    * Solution: Replace the entire distributor assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.8L DOHC VTEC Inline-4 B18C1 (GS-R)**

* **VTEC Solenoid Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Lack of power at high RPM, VTEC not engaging, check engine light (often with a VTEC system code).
    * Solution: Inspect and clean the VTEC solenoid screen. If the solenoid itself is faulty, replace it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $250
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, especially at higher mileage. Can be due to worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    * Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source of the oil consumption. Repair options range from replacing valve stem seals to a full engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Synchro Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, especially 2nd and 3rd.
    * Solution: Replace the worn synchros. Requires transmission disassembly and rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Clutch Master/Slave Cylinder Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, soft or spongy clutch pedal, clutch pedal sticking to the floor.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty clutch master or slave cylinder. Bleed the clutch hydraulic system after replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Slipping or Erratic Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, delayed or harsh shifts, transmission slipping out of gear.
    * Solution: Could be due to low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or a faulty valve body. A transmission fluid flush and filter change may help in some cases. If the problem persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on the severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, loose steering, poor handling, uneven tire wear. Common areas for bushing wear include the front lower control arms, rear trailing arms, and sway bar links.
    * Solution: Replace the worn bushings. It's often easier and more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm rather than pressing in new bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per corner depending on the components replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, poor handling, leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts/shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ for a full set.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Main Relay Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting problems, especially in hot weather. The main relay provides power to the fuel pump and ECU.

**Summary**

The 1995 Acura Integra, while a generally reliable vehicle, is prone to age-related issues. Engine issues range from minor leaks to oil consumption, depending on the specific engine type and mileage. Transmission problems include synchro wear in the manual and slipping in the automatic. Suspension issues are primarily related to worn bushings and struts. Electrical problems include main relay and power window motor failures. Rust is a common concern, especially in areas with harsh weather. Interior issues such as a cracked dashboard and a broken center console latch are also fairly common. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them can significantly improve the vehicle's reliability and driving experience.
