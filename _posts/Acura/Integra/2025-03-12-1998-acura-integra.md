The 1998 Acura Integra is a popular compact sports car known for its reliability, sporty handling, and available high-revving engines. Engine options included the 1.8L DOHC inline-4 (B18B1) producing 140 hp and 127 lb-ft of torque in the RS, LS, and GS trims, and the 1.8L DOHC VTEC inline-4 (B18C1) producing 170 hp and 128 lb-ft of torque in the GS-R trim. A 5-speed manual transmission was standard, with a 4-speed automatic available on non-GS-R trims. Enthusiasts appreciate the Integra for its precise steering, smooth engine, and overall fun-to-drive character. Some common complaints include road noise, limited rear seat space, and the car's tendency to attract unwanted attention due to its sporty image.

**Summary:**

The 1998 Acura Integra, while generally reliable, has its share of potential issues. Engine issues include distributor failure on the B18B1 and oil leaks on the B18C1, which tend to be moderate in cost. Transmission problems, especially synchro wear in the manual transmission, can be expensive to address. Suspension issues like worn bushings are common and moderately priced to fix. Electrical problems such as power window and door lock actuator failures are also potential concerns. Rust, particularly on the rear quarter panels, can be a significant issue, especially in regions where road salt is used. Overall, while these problems exist, they don't necessarily detract from the Integra's reputation as a fun and dependable car, but potential buyers should be aware and inspect the vehicle carefully.
