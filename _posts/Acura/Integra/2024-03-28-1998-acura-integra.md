**Introduction**

The 1998 Acura Integra is a compact sports coupe known for its high performance and affordability. It comes equipped with a 1.8L inline-four engine paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The Integra GTS model adds a more powerful 1.8L VTEC engine with the same transmission options.

    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **VTEC Solenoid Failure:** The VTEC solenoid controls the VTEC system and can fail over time. This can result in reduced engine performance.
    * Solution: Replace the VTEC solenoid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
* **Timing Belt Failure:** Refer to the 1.8L engine section for more details.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Wear:** The clutch disc and pressure plate can wear out over time, resulting in slipping or difficulty engaging gears.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Transmission Grinding:** The transmission may grind when shifting gears due to worn synchronizers or shift forks.
    * Solution: Replace the worn components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slipping:** The transmission may slip when shifting gears due to worn clutches or valve body issues.
    * Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Electrical issues can cause the shift solenoids to fail, resulting in transmission problems.
