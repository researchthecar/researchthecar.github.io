**Introduction:**

The 1999 Acura Integra is a sporty compact car known for its handling and performance. It is available with either a 1.8L 4-cylinder engine (140 hp, 125 lb-ft) or a 1.8L VTEC 4-cylinder engine (170 hp, 125 lb-ft). Transmission options include a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic.

People have praised the Integra for its sharp handling, responsive steering, and comfortable interior. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of features and cramped back seat.

**Engine**

**1.8L 4-cylinder**
