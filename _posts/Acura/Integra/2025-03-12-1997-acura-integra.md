The 1997 Acura Integra is a compact sports car known for its reliability, handling, and sporty driving experience. Available in various trims, including the base model, LS, GS, and the high-performance GS-R, the Integra offers a blend of practicality and fun. While appreciated for its nimble chassis and responsive engines, some common issues have surfaced over the years. The 1997 Integra came with either a 1.8L DOHC 4-cylinder engine (LS, GS) or a 1.8L VTEC DOHC 4-cylinder engine (GS-R). The LS/GS engine produces 140 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque.
