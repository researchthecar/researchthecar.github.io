**2000 Acura Integra Overview**

The 2000 Acura Integra was a popular sports compact car known for its performance, handling, and reliability. It was available with a variety of engine and transmission options, including the 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine with 140 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque and the 1.8-liter four-cylinder VTEC engine with 170 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

Despite its overall reliability, the 2000 Acura Integra has had some reported issues, mainly concerning its engine and transmission.

**Engine**

* **1.8-liter Non-VTEC Engine**
    * **Valve Spring Failure:** Premature wear and breakage of valve springs can occur, leading to reduced engine performance and potential catastrophic engine failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, decreased power, and increased oil consumption. The solution is to replace the affected valve springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    * **Distributor Shaft Seal Leak:** The distributor shaft seal can develop a leak, allowing oil to seep out. Symptoms include an oil leak around the distributor and a burning oil smell. The solution is to replace the distributor shaft seal. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300
* **1.8-liter VTEC Engine**
    * **VTEC Solenoid Failure:** The VTEC solenoid, which controls the VTEC system, can fail, resulting in decreased engine performance above the VTEC engagement point. Symptoms include a lack of power at higher RPMs and a Check Engine Light. The solution is to replace the VTEC solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure:** The camshaft position sensor can fail, causing the engine to run poorly or stall. Symptoms include rough idling, stalling, and a Check Engine Light. The solution is to replace the camshaft position sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Manual Transmission:**
    * **Clutch Master Cylinder Failure:** The clutch master cylinder can fail, resulting in difficulty shifting gears or a complete loss of clutch function. Symptoms include a soft or spongy clutch pedal, leaking brake fluid, and difficulty or inability to shift gears. The solution is to replace the clutch master cylinder. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * **Input Shaft Bearing Failure:** The input shaft bearing can fail, causing a grinding noise when shifting gears. Symptoms include a grinding noise when engaging first or second gear, and difficulty shifting into gear. The solution is to replace the input shaft bearing. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **4-Speed Automatic Transmission:**
    * **Torque Converter Lock-Up Solenoid Failure:** The torque converter lock-up solenoid can fail, leading to slipping gears and a loss of power. Symptoms include shuddering or slipping during gear shifts, especially at highway speeds. The solution is to replace the torque converter lock-up solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500
    * **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Failure:** The TCM can fail, causing a variety of transmission problems. Symptoms include erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and a Check Engine Light. The solution is to replace the TCM. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
