The 1992 Acura Integra is a popular compact sports car known for its engaging driving dynamics and reliability, although, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. Engine options included the 1.7L D17A1 I4 engine with 130 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque (GS/LS trim) and the 1.8L B18A1 I4 engine with 140 horsepower and 121 lb-ft of torque (GS-R trim). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. People often appreciate the Integra's sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and overall dependability. However, some common criticisms include the relatively basic interior and the potential for rust in certain climates.
