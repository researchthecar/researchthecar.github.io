**Summary**

The 1999 Acura Integra is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of common issues such as distributor failure, oil leaks, worn synchronizers, and rust. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely depending on the condition of the vehicle and the extent of the damage. Engine issues, especially those related to the B18C1 (GS-R) like oil consumption, can be the most expensive to address. Suspension and electrical problems are also common but generally less costly to repair. Rust, while a common issue for vehicles of this age, can also lead to significant repair costs if left unaddressed.
