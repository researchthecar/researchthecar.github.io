The 2001 Acura Integra is a front-wheel drive sport compact car known for its reliability, sporty handling, and aftermarket support. It was offered with two primary engine options: a 1.8-liter DOHC inline-4 (B18B1) producing 140 hp and 127 lb-ft of torque in the RS, LS, and GS trims, and a more potent 1.8-liter DOHC VTEC inline-4 (B18C1) making 170 hp and 128 lb-ft of torque in the GS-R trim. A highly sought-after Type R trim also existed, but it had unique characteristics outside the scope of this request. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic, depending on the trim. Many enthusiasts appreciate the Integra's balanced handling, rev-happy engines, and simple yet engaging driving experience. Common dislikes often revolve around road noise, relatively basic interior features, and the car's propensity to be targeted for theft.

**Summary**

The 2001 Acura Integra presents a mix of age-related and inherent issues. Engine oil leaks and synchro wear in the manual transmission are relatively common problems, with costs ranging from manageable to potentially significant, depending on the severity. Suspension issues, electrical glitches, and rust formation also surface as potential concerns. Overall, many of the issues can be addressed with reasonably priced parts and labor, making the Integra a worthwhile project car for the right buyer willing to invest in maintenance and repairs. However, major engine or transmission overhauls could lead to substantial repair costs.
