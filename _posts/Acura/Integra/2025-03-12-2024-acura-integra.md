The 2024 Acura Integra marks the return of a beloved nameplate, offering a sporty and stylish compact sedan experience. It's generally praised for its sharp handling, comfortable ride, and premium interior feel. However, some owners have voiced concerns about certain aspects of the vehicle. The standard engine is a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 200 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or, on the A-Spec model, an optional 6-speed manual transmission. The Integra is praised for its looks and ride, but many complain about the perceived value and similarities to the Honda Civic Si.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported observing a noticeable decrease in oil levels between oil changes. There have been no widespread reports of oil consumption but this is a common issue for Honda/Acura cars with VTEC engines.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and topping off as needed is the primary solution. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection to check for leaks or internal engine issues is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depending on the source and severity of the leak, or internal engine damage, cost could range from under $100 (minor leak fix) to thousands for major engine work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light indicating a fuel injector problem.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the number of injectors needing replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Jerky or Hesitant Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerky or hesitant acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can manifest as a lag in response when pressing the accelerator or a feeling of the transmission "hunting" for the right gear.
    *   Solution: A software update or CVT fluid change may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, CVT replacement could be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for a fluid change, $100-$300 for a software update, $4,000 - $8,000+ for CVT replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, lags, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio controls, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or updating the infotainment software can sometimes resolve the issue. In some cases, hardware replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software updates), $100 - $300 for troubleshooting and minor repairs, $500 - $1500+ for infotainment system replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver-Assistance System Errors (e.g., Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Assist)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional errors or malfunctions with driver-assistance systems, such as adaptive cruise control disengaging unexpectedly or lane-keeping assist not functioning correctly.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of the system sensors or replacement of faulty sensors or modules may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ for recalibration, $300 - $1000+ for sensor or module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling or squeaking noises emanating from various areas of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and tightening loose fasteners or adding sound-deadening material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the complexity of the repair and the labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck or rattle.
    *   Solution: Tightening loose fasteners, cleaning sunroof tracks, or replacing faulty parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the complexity of the repair and the labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Panel Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gaps or misaligned body panels, particularly around the doors, hood, or trunk.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the body panels to improve alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the severity of the misalignment and the labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Acura Integra appears to have relatively few widespread, serious issues at this point in its model cycle. The most commonly reported problems relate to electrical glitches (infotainment, driver-assistance systems) and minor interior rattles. Some potential concerns regarding the engine and transmission, particularly the CVT, exist, but it's important to note these are not universally experienced. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs if major component replacements are required. The cost to address these issues can range from under $100 for minor fixes to potentially thousands of dollars for more significant repairs like transmission replacement. Given the vehicle is relatively new, ongoing monitoring of owner experiences will be crucial to fully assess long-term reliability.
