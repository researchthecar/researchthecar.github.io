The 2023 Acura Integra marked the return of a beloved nameplate, aiming to blend sporty driving dynamics with premium features and practicality. It's powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 200 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) and a 6-speed manual transmission (available only on the A-Spec trim with Technology Package). Owners generally praise the Integra's sharp handling, comfortable interior, and stylish design. However, some criticisms include the CVT's performance compared to the manual, the slightly firm ride quality (especially on A-Spec models), and some reported software glitches with the infotainment system.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil more often than expected.
    *   Solution: Dealers may perform an oil consumption test to determine the extent of the issue. If excessive consumption is confirmed, the repair may involve replacing piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling or a misfire, possibly caused by a faulty fuel injector. The engine might exhibit hesitation during acceleration or throw a check engine light related to fuel trim or misfires.

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. The CVT might feel unresponsive or exhibit unusual shifting behavior.
    *   Solution: The initial solution dealers have been trying is a software update to the CVT control module. If the issue persists, a CVT replacement may be required.
