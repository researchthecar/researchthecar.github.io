# 2000 Acura Integra Reliability & Common Issues

### Overview
The 2000 Acura Integra, a popular compact sports coupe and sedan, was available in several trims, primarily powered by a 1.8-liter inline-four engine. The base LS and RS models produced approximately 140 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, while the performance-oriented GS-R trim featured a VTEC-equipped engine generating around 170 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. The Type R variant, a track-focused homologation special, boasted an even more potent 1.8-liter VTEC engine producing 195 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally praised the Integra for its engaging driving dynamics, sharp handling, and reliable powertrain. However, common complaints sometimes revolved around aging interior components and the potential for certain mechanical wear over time, especially in higher-mileage examples.

## 🛠 Component Categories

### Engine
#### 1.8L DOHC VTEC (B18C1 - GS-R)
**Piston Ring Wear (Oil Consumption)**
- **Description/Symptoms:** Excessive oil consumption, particularly noticeable after spirited driving or on high-mileage engines. This can lead to blue smoke from the exhaust and fouled spark plugs.
- **Solution:** Engine rebuild with new piston rings.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1500 - $3000 (depending on labor rates and scope of rebuild)
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

#### 1.8L DOHC VTEC (B18C5 - Type R)
**Oil Ring Failure**
- **Description/Symptoms:** Similar to the B18C1, but often associated with higher-performance use. Can result in significant oil consumption and potential engine damage if not addressed.
- **Solution:** Engine rebuild with new oil rings and potentially other internal components.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1800 - $3500 (depending on labor rates and scope of rebuild)
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

#### 1.8L DOHC Non-VTEC (B18B1 - LS/RS)
No widespread mechanical failures documented for this specific configuration. Standard maintenance is key.

### Transmission
#### Manual Transmission (All Trims)
**Clutch Wear**
- **Description/Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, or a spongy clutch pedal. This is a wear item on all manual transmissions and is not indicative of a specific defect.
- **Solution:** Clutch replacement.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1000
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

#### Automatic Transmission (LS/RS/GS-R)
**Torque Converter Shudder**
- **Description/Symptoms:** A vibration or shudder felt when the transmission is trying to lock up the torque converter, typically at cruising speeds.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid service, or potential torque converter replacement if the issue persists.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400 for fluid service; $1000 - $2000 for torque converter replacement.
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

### Suspension & Chassis
**Subframe Rust**
- **Description/Symptoms:** Significant rust on the front and/or rear subframes, particularly in areas with heavy road salt usage. Can lead to structural integrity concerns.
- **Solution:** Subframe replacement or extensive rust repair.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $800 - $2000 per subframe (depending on extent of rust and labor)
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

### Electrical
**Alternator Failure**
- **Description/Symptoms:** Battery warning light illuminated, dimming headlights, or complete electrical system failure.
- **Solution:** Alternator replacement.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $600
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

**Power Window Motor Failure**
- **Description/Symptoms:** Power windows stop operating or operate slowly.
- **Solution:** Power window motor replacement.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400 per window
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

### Exterior
**Sun-faded Paint (Roof and Hood)**
- **Description/Symptoms:** The clear coat and paint on the roof and hood can degrade and fade due to prolonged sun exposure, especially on darker colored vehicles. This is cosmetic.
- **Solution:** Repainting the affected panels.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $400 - $1000+ per panel
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

### Interior
**HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
- **Description/Symptoms:** The blower motor only works on certain speed settings, or not at all.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $250
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

**Door Panel Sagging**
- **Description/Symptoms:** Interior door panels can start to sag or detach from the door frame, particularly on older vehicles.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of the door panel clips or the entire door panel.
- **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $50 - $200
- **Recalls:** None specific to this issue.

### Summary
The 2000 Acura Integra is generally considered a reliable vehicle with a strong enthusiast following. The most common issues tend to be related to wear and tear on aging components, such as the clutch and suspension, rather than inherent design flaws. Engine oil consumption can be a concern in higher-mileage examples of the VTEC engines. Proactive maintenance and addressing rust can significantly contribute to the long-term viability and value of this sporty compact. Overall, the cost of ownership for a well-maintained 2000 Integra is typically moderate, with most repairs falling within expected ranges for a vehicle of its age.
