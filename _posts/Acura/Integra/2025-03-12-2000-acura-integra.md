The 2000 Acura Integra is a front-wheel-drive compact car known for its sporty handling, reliability, and fun-to-drive nature. The Integra was available with a 1.8-liter DOHC 4-cylinder engine, with the GS-R trim receiving a more powerful VTEC version. The base 1.8L engine produced 140 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, while the GS-R's 1.8L VTEC engine generated 170 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Many enthusiasts praise the Integra for its engaging driving dynamics, precise steering, and high-revving engines. However, common complaints often include road noise, a relatively basic interior, and, with its age, potential issues related to wear and tear.
