### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Acura RL is a generally reliable luxury sedan, with its V6 engine and automatic transmission proving robust for their age. Key areas to monitor for potential issues include the timing belt, which requires timely replacement to prevent catastrophic engine damage, and potential oil leaks from valve cover gaskets. Transmission issues like slipping can occur and may require significant repair costs. Suspension components such as ball joints, tie rods, and struts are subject to wear and tear and may need replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and alternator failure, are also noted concerns for vehicles of this vintage. While the exterior is typically durable, interior components like the HVAC blower motor resistor can fail. Overall, with diligent maintenance and attention to these common wear points, the 2001 RL can remain a dependable vehicle.
