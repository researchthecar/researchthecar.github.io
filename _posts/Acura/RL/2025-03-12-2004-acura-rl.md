Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2004 Acura RL, formatted as requested:

The 2004 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and technology features for its time, such as navigation and a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system. It was only offered with one engine and transmission combination: a 3.5L V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 256 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and overall build quality. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated styling compared to more modern competitors and the sometimes-complex electronic systems.
