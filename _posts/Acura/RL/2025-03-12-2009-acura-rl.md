The 2009 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, advanced technology features (for its time), and Acura's reputation for reliability. It was only offered with a single engine and transmission configuration. A common point of praise is the comfortable ride and quiet cabin, while some criticisms include the somewhat dated styling and the lack of a more powerful engine option compared to some competitors. The 2009 Acura RL features a 3.7L V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.
