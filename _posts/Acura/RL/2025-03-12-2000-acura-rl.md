# 2000 Acura RL Reliability & Common Issues

### Overview
The 2000 Acura RL, a luxury sedan, was powered by a naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V6 engine. This powerplant produced approximately 210 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owner pros often cited its smooth ride, refined interior, and reliable drivetrain. However, some cons included its dated styling by contemporary standards and a less engaging driving experience compared to some German rivals.
