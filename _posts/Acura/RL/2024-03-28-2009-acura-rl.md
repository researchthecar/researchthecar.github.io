**Introduction:**

The 2009 Acura RL is a mid-size luxury sedan powered by a 3.5L V6 engine paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. It delivers 290 horsepower and 256 lb-ft of torque. Praised for its refined driving experience, comfortable interior, and advanced technology, the RL has also faced some common issues over the years.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **Intake Valve Throttling Body Carbon Buildup:** Over time, carbon deposits accumulate in the intake valves and throttle body, restricting airflow. This leads to reduced performance, decreased fuel efficiency, and rough idling. The solution involves cleaning or replacing the affected parts. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $600+.
* **VVT Adjuster Solenoid Failure:** The VVT adjuster solenoids regulate the timing of the variable valve timing system. A faulty solenoid can cause the engine to run erratically, including rough idling, loss of power, or even stalling. Replacement of the faulty solenoid is required. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000.
* **Loss of Oil Pressure:** In some cases, a faulty oil pressure switch or a leak in the oil system can result in reduced oil pressure. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed promptly. Repairing the oil system and replacing any defective components is necessary. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $2,000+.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Slipping or Hesitation:** Occasional slipping or hesitation during gear changes can indicate worn or faulty transmission components, such as clutches or solenoids. Transmission fluid replacement or a more extensive repair may be required. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $2,500+.
* **Shifting Issues:** Difficulty shifting gears or shifting into the wrong gear can be caused by a faulty shift solenoid, linkage, or other transmission problems. Repairing or replacing the affected components can resolve the issue. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $1,500+.

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Failure:** Worn or damaged strut mounts can result in excessive noise, vibration, and reduced handling. Replacing the strut mounts can restore proper suspension performance. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $800+.
* **Sway Bar Links:** Deteriorated or broken sway bar links can cause clunking sounds and affect the vehicle's handling. Replacement of the affected links is recommended. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic battery drain can be caused by a faulty component or electrical system issue. Identifying the source and repairing or replacing the affected component is necessary. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $1,000+.
* **Cruise Control Module Failure:** A malfunctioning cruise control module can prevent the cruise control from functioning properly or causing unintended acceleration. Replacing the faulty module is usually the solution. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,200.

**Exterior**

* **Door Lock Malfunction:** Occasional issues with the door lock mechanism, such as difficulty locking or unlocking, can be caused by worn or faulty actuators or other components. Repair or replacement of the problematic parts is required. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $800+.

**Interior**

* **Navigation System Malfunction:** The navigation system may experience occasional issues, including freezing, slow response times, or incorrect directions. Software updates or replacing the system components may resolve the problem. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $2,000+.
* **Sunroof Panel Malfunction:** The sunroof panel can occasionally get stuck or leak due to worn or damaged seals, cables, or motors. Repairing or replacing the affected components is necessary. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,500+.

**Summary:**

The 2009 Acura RL faces some common issues, including engine carbon buildup, transmission problems, and electrical malfunctions. While some issues can be minor and inexpensive to fix, others, such as major engine or transmission repairs, can be costly. However, most RL owners report a high level of satisfaction with the vehicle's overall driving experience, comfort, and reliability.
