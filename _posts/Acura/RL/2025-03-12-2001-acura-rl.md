The 2001 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and understated elegance. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 210 horsepower and 224 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often appreciate the RL for its smooth handling, quiet cabin, and reputation for longevity. However, some common complaints include outdated technology, less engaging driving dynamics compared to sportier competitors, and the age-related issues that naturally arise in a vehicle of this vintage.

**Summary**

The 2001 Acura RL, while generally reliable, is subject to age-related issues. Engine oil leaks and timing belt wear are common concerns, potentially leading to significant expenses if neglected. Suspension components also wear over time, affecting ride quality and handling. Electrical gremlins, such as power window and sensor failures, can also arise. Rust can be a problem, particularly in areas with harsh winters. While not all issues are extremely severe, addressing them promptly is crucial for maintaining the vehicle's longevity and safety. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, but owners should be prepared for potential expenses ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars over the course of ownership.
