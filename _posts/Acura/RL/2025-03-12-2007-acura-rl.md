The 2007 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, advanced technology for its time (such as SH-AWD), and reliability. It came standard with a 3.5L SOHC VTEC V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 256 lb-ft of torque. It was paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the RL's smooth power delivery, quiet cabin, and all-weather capability thanks to the SH-AWD system. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated styling, less engaging driving experience compared to some rivals, and fuel economy that isn't particularly impressive for its class.

**Engine**

**3.5L SOHC VTEC V6**

*   **VTEC Solenoid Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the VTEC solenoid gasket, leading to oil consumption and potential damage to other components if left unaddressed.

**Summary**

The 2007 Acura RL presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from relatively minor problems like VTEC solenoid leaks to more significant concerns like SH-AWD unit failures. Electrical gremlins within the navigation system and sunroof malfunctions could also be present. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to address, others can be costly, particularly those related to the SH-AWD system, transmission, or dashboard cracking. Thorough inspection and maintenance are key to mitigating these potential problems, as are proactive repairs when problems are identified.
