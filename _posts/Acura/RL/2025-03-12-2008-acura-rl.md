The 2008 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, advanced technology features for its time, and Acura's reputation for reliability. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 256 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission and Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system. Owners generally appreciate the RL's smooth and quiet ride, strong performance, and comprehensive standard features. Some common dislikes include the somewhat dated styling compared to competitors, the complex SH-AWD system potentially leading to expensive repairs, and the limited rear seat space for a car of its size.
