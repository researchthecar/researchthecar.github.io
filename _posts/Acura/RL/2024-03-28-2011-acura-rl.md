**Introduction:**

The 2011 Acura RL is a luxurious midsize sedan that offers a combination of performance, comfort, and technology. It comes standard with a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Other engine and transmission options include a 3.5-liter V6 hybrid with a 5-speed automatic transmission and a high-performance 3.7-liter V6 SH-AWD with a 6-speed sequential automatic transmission.
