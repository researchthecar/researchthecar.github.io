### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Acura RL is a generally dependable luxury sedan, but like many vehicles of its age, it is not immune to specific mechanical and electrical issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine's timing belt, which requires proactive replacement to avoid catastrophic failure, and potential oil leaks from valve cover gaskets. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, can also arise and may require significant repair. Electrical components like the alternator and power window motors are also noted points of failure. While the exterior is largely free of widespread problems, interior components like the HVAC blower resistor can fail. Regular maintenance and addressing these known issues promptly will contribute to the long-term reliability of the 2002 RL.
