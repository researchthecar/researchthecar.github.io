The 2010 Acura RL is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, advanced technology for its time, and Acura's reputation for reliability. It came standard with a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciate the RL's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and strong acceleration, some common complaints include the somewhat dated styling, the less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to its competitors, and the complex navigation and infotainment system.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every few thousand miles and sometimes blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using a higher-viscosity oil may help. In severe cases, engine repairs such as piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the VVT system can lead to rough idling, decreased performance, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the VVT system, potentially involving replacement of the VVT solenoid or actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with genuine Acura ATF-Z1 (or the updated DW-1 fluid) can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid flush, $500 - $1500+ for valve body work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Active Damper System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2010 Acura RL featured an active damper system designed to improve ride quality and handling. Failure of the dampers or associated sensors can lead to a harsher ride, warning lights, and decreased performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty dampers or sensors. This can be an expensive repair due to the cost of the active damper components. Replacing the front and rear strut can also fix the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per damper or sensor to replace, $300 to $700 for a replacement strut.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system can experience issues with software glitches, map data errors, and screen failures.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve minor glitches. Replacing the navigation unit is necessary for more serious issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update (if available), $500 - $1500+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with pairing devices, dropped connections, or poor audio quality during Bluetooth calls.
    *   Solution: Updating the Bluetooth software (if available). In some cases, replacing the Bluetooth module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for software update, $200 - $500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **HID Headlight Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the HID headlights or ballasts, resulting in dim or non-functional headlights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the HID bulb or ballast.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per bulb or ballast.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, fail to open or close properly, or leak water into the cabin.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the sunroof tracks and mechanism can sometimes resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, the sunroof motor or assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 for lubrication/adjustment, $300 - $1000+ for motor or assembly replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Seat Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power seats failing to adjust in certain directions or becoming completely inoperable.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the power seat motors, switches, or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Acura RL is a generally reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues. The most prevalent include excessive oil consumption and harsh shifting. The active damper suspension and electrical issues can also be a source of frustration for owners. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, such as active damper replacement or extensive engine work, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision and budget for potential maintenance.
