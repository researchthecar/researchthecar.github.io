The 1996 Acura RL, also known as the Honda Legend in some markets, was a luxury sedan known for its smooth ride and comfortable interior. It came with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 210 horsepower and 224 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the car's reliability and understated elegance, while some criticize its relatively low power output compared to some competitors and its somewhat dated styling even at the time.
