### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Acura RL is a generally dependable luxury sedan, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 3.5L V6 engine can experience timing belt failures if not maintained, and oil leaks from valve cover gaskets are not uncommon. The 5-speed automatic transmission may develop issues with harsh shifting or slipping over time. Electrical components like the alternator and power window actuators are also reported failure points. While the exterior and suspension are relatively robust, interior climate control systems can sometimes falter with blower motor issues. Proactive maintenance, especially regarding the timing belt, and addressing minor leaks promptly can help mitigate more significant repair costs.
