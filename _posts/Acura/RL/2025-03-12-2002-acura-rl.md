The 2002 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and understated elegance. It came with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter SOHC VTEC V6, producing 225 horsepower and 231 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the RL for its smooth and quiet driving experience, spacious interior, and Acura's reputation for longevity. However, some common complaints revolve around its age, which can lead to issues with parts wearing out and becoming more challenging to find, as well as some quirks with the electrical system and suspension.

**Engine**

**3.5L SOHC VTEC V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various points on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots on the driveway, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Thorough cleaning of the affected areas is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail due to age, overheating, or contamination. Symptoms include a check engine light (often with codes P0420 or P0430), decreased fuel efficiency, and a sulfur smell from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ depending on the aftermarket or OEM replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can develop issues with harsh shifting between gears or slipping out of gear, especially as the vehicle ages. These issues can be caused by worn clutch packs, solenoid failure, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and filter change might help in minor cases. However, more severe cases might require transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for a flush; $800 - $3000+ for repair or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shock absorbers can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased braking distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the struts and shocks. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Deteriorated control arm bushings can cause clunking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. This can also lead to loose handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ per control arm, depending on whether just the bushings or the whole arm is replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Climate Control Issues**

**Summary**

The 2002 Acura RL, while generally reliable, can exhibit issues related to its age, particularly in the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Oil leaks, catalytic converter failures, and transmission problems are among the more costly potential repairs. Rust is also a potential concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. While the RL offers a comfortable and luxurious ride, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential maintenance costs.
