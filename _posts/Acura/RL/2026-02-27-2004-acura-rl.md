## Engine

### 3.5L V6 (J35A8)
**Timing Belt Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Sudden loss of power, engine stalling, check engine light, potential catastrophic engine damage if belt breaks.
- **Solution:** Replace timing belt, tensioner, and water pump proactively at recommended intervals (typically 90,000-105,000 miles).
- **Cost:** $700 - $1200

**Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup or at idle; check engine light with VVT-related codes.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the VVT actuator and potentially related solenoids.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Automatic (BDGA)
**Transmission Slipping/Hesitation**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, slipping between gears, rough shifting, or shuddering.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, potential internal repairs or transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $300 - $3500+


## Suspension

### Active Dampening System
**Leaking Struts/Shocks**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, uneven tire wear, visible fluid leaks from suspension components.
- **Solution:** Replacement of leaking struts or shocks.
- **Cost:** $600 - $1000


## Electrical

### Alternator
**Alternator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light illuminated, electrical components malfunctioning, dead battery.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


### Power Window Motors
**Window Motor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows not operating, slow window operation.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the power window motor and regulator assembly.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500 per window


## Exterior

### Standard Chassis
**No Major Issues**
- **Symptoms:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Solution:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Cost:** No widespread issues reported.


## Interior

### Standard Cabin
**HVAC Blower Motor Resistor**
- **Symptoms:** HVAC fan only works on the highest setting, or not at all.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
- **Cost:** $100 - $250

### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Acura RL offers a blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 3.5L V6 engine can experience timing belt failures if not maintained, and VVT actuator problems can arise. The automatic transmission may develop slipping issues over time. Suspension components, particularly the active dampening system, can develop leaks. Electrical gremlins like alternator failure and power window motor issues are also noted. Interior comfort can be affected by HVAC blower motor resistor failures. Proactive maintenance, especially for the timing belt, and addressing these specific components can help ensure the longevity and reliability of the 2004 RL.
