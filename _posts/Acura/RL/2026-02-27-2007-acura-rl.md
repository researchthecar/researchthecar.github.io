### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Acura RL generally offers good reliability, particularly with its robust SH-AWD system. However, owners should be aware of potential issues related to the VCM system and timing belt maintenance for the 3.5L V6 engine. Transmission issues, while not rampant, can occur and typically involve leaks or torque converter problems. Electrical components like the alternator and power steering pump are also noted areas for potential repair. Interior electronics, especially the navigation system, can sometimes exhibit glitches. Proactive maintenance and addressing early symptoms can significantly mitigate these potential reliability concerns.
