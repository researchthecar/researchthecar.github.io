The 2012 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, standard all-wheel drive (SH-AWD), and refined interior. It only came with one engine and transmission option: a 3.7-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the RL's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and standard features, but it was often criticized for its outdated styling, less engaging driving experience compared to competitors, and lower fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 3.7L V6 engine consuming more oil than expected, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil light illuminating or noticing a significant drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and using the correct grade of oil are essential. In more severe cases, potential repairs may include replacing piston rings or addressing valve seal issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTEC Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) solenoid can fail, leading to a loss of power and/or rough running. This is often accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty VTEC solenoid.
