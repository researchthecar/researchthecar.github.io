The 2003 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, reliability, and understated elegance. This model year came with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter SOHC VTEC V6 engine producing 225 horsepower and 231 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the RL's smooth power delivery, quiet cabin, and Acura's reputation for longevity. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated styling compared to competitors, and the lack of some advanced features available in other luxury cars of the time.
