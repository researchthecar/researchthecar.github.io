The 2005 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, advanced technology for its time (like Acura's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive - SH-AWD), and relatively understated styling. It came standard with a 3.5L SOHC VTEC V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate its reliability, comfortable interior, and SH-AWD system for enhanced handling. Common dislikes include the dated infotainment system and some potential maintenance costs associated with the advanced technology.
