## Engine

### 3.5L V6 (J35A1)
**Timing Belt Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Sudden loss of power, engine stalling, potential for severe internal engine damage if belt breaks.
- **Solution:** Replace timing belt, tensioner, and water pump at recommended intervals (typically 90,000-105,000 miles).
- **Cost:** $600 - $1000

**Oil Leaks (Rear Main Seal)**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil drips under the vehicle, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Replace rear main crankshaft seal.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic (BDGA)
**Harsh Shifting / Slipping**
- **Symptoms:** Jerky gear changes, delayed engagement, or inability to shift gears properly.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or full transmission rebuild/replacement.
- **Cost:** $300 - $2500+


## Suspension

### Standard Independent Suspension
**Worn Ball Joints / Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and/or control arm bushings.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Electrical

### General Electrical System
**Alternator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light illuminated, eventual battery drain and stalling.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700

**Power Window Motor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Windows not operating, slow operation, clicking noises.
- **Solution:** Replacement of individual power window motors.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Exterior

### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Acura RL is a generally dependable luxury sedan, but like many vehicles of its age, it is susceptible to certain common issues. The 3.5L V6 engine, while robust, can experience timing belt related problems if maintenance is neglected, and oil leaks are not uncommon. The automatic transmission may develop shifting issues over time. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the alternator and power window motors, are also reported. Exterior paint, specifically the clear coat, can degrade with age and sun exposure. Interiorly, HVAC blower resistors and dashboard lighting are known failure points. Regular maintenance, especially timely timing belt replacement and transmission fluid service, is crucial for maximizing the longevity of the 2000 RL.
