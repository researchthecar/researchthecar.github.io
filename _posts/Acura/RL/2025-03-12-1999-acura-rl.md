The 1999 Acura RL is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, reliable engine, and elegant styling. It came with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 210 horsepower and 224 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the RL's smooth and quiet ride, its well-appointed interior, and its reputation for longevity. However, some common complaints include issues with the transmission, electrical problems related to the climate control system, and suspension wear. The age of the vehicle means that many of these issues are surfacing due to normal wear and tear over time.
