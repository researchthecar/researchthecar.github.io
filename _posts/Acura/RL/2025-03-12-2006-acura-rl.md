The 2006 Acura RL is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system, comfortable ride, and advanced technology for its time. All 2006 RLs came equipped with a 3.5-liter SOHC VTEC V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 256 lb-ft of torque. It was exclusively paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the RL's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and reliability. Common complaints revolve around the dated infotainment system, lower than expected fuel economy, and some specific electronic issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L SOHC VTEC V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may manifest as a burning oil smell or visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels closely and use the correct grade of oil. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic can perform a leak-down test to check for worn piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets can cause a burning smell and oil drips on the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears, or transmission slipping. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid change using Honda/Acura ATF-Z1 or DW-1 fluid. If the problem persists, further diagnosis of the transmission's internal components, such as solenoids or valve body, may be necessary. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) to $2500 - $4000 (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **SH-AWD System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: SH-AWD system failures are rare but can occur. Symptoms include a warning light on the dashboard and reduced traction in slippery conditions. The rear differential and its electronic components are most commonly affected.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is crucial to pinpoint the source of the problem. Faulty sensors, actuators, or the rear differential itself may require replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the specific component that has failed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially over bumps, can indicate worn ball joints, control arm bushings, or struts. Reduced handling precision and uneven tire wear are also possible symptoms.
    *   Solution: Inspection of suspension components by a qualified mechanic. Replacement of worn parts is necessary to restore proper ride and handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the components replaced.
