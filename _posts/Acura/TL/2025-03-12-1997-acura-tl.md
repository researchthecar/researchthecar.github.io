The 1997 Acura TL was a mid-size luxury sedan that offered a blend of comfort, reliability, and performance. The 1997 Acura TL came with two different engine options: a 2.5L SOHC 20-valve inline 5-cylinder (producing 176 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.2L SOHC 24-valve V6 (producing 200 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the TL for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and Acura's reputation for reliability. However, some common complaints included issues with the automatic transmission, electrical glitches, and certain components wearing out over time.
