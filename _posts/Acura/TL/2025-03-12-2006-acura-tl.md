The 2006 Acura TL is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and Acura's reputation for reliability. It was available with a 3.2L V6 engine (258 hp and 233 lb-ft of torque) paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission (on the TL Type-S introduced later). The TL was praised for its engaging driving experience and upscale features, but some owners have reported certain common issues. Some complaints include electrical problems and premature wear of certain components.

**Summary**

The 2006 Acura TL is generally a reliable car, but certain issues are more common than others. The most concerning potential problems involve the transmission (specifically the torque converter on the automatic models) and electrical components like the navigation screen. Suspension wear and tear is expected for a vehicle of this age. While the Valve Cover Gasket and compliance bushing issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, the navigation screen and transmission problems can be costly. Carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems before purchasing, and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
