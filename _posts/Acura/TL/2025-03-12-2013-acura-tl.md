Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2013 Acura TL, adhering to your specified format.

The 2013 Acura TL is a mid-size sedan known for its blend of luxury, reliability, and sporty performance. It came with two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7-liter V6 generating 305 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. The 3.5L V6 was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.7L was available with either a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission (SH-AWD models). People generally liked the TL for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Acura's reputation for dependability. Dislikes often centered around its somewhat controversial styling, especially the "beak" front grille, and some found the infotainment system dated compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption due to piston ring issues, particularly in models with the VCM system. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, misfires, and eventual catalytic converter damage. Symptoms include the engine burning through oil faster than normal, blue exhaust smoke, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: A temporary fix is to disable the VCM system with an aftermarket device (like VCMuzzler II). More comprehensive solutions include replacing the piston rings or replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: VCMuzzler II $100, Piston ring replacement $2,000-$4,000+, Engine Replacement $5,000-$8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals, especially the valve cover gaskets and the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots under the car, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gaskets $200-$400, Rear main seal $500-$1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption due to piston ring issues. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, misfires, and eventual catalytic converter damage. Symptoms include the engine burning through oil faster than normal, blue exhaust smoke, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: A temporary fix is to constantly monitor oil levels and add as needed. More comprehensive solutions include replacing the piston rings or replacing the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Piston ring replacement $2,000-$4,000+, Engine Replacement $5,000-$8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both 3.5L and 3.7L)**

*   **Transmission Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. Can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If that doesn't resolve the issue, further diagnosis is needed, potentially leading to valve body repair/replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission fluid flush $150-$300, Valve body repair/replacement $800-$1,500, Transmission rebuild $3,000-$5,000, Transmission replacement $4,000-$6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the dampers. This results in poor ride quality and the inability of the suspension to properly absorb road defects.

**Summary**

The 2013 Acura TL, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption in both the 3.5L and 3.7L V6 engines, which can be costly to repair. Transmission shifting problems are another area of concern, though these can sometimes be resolved with maintenance. Electrical issues, such as Bluetooth and navigation problems, are less critical but can still be frustrating. Overall, the severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, making a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic crucial.
