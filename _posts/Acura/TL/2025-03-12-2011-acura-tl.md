Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2011 Acura TL, categorized by component and powertrain configuration. The 2011 Acura TL is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its reliability and comfortable ride. It came with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 producing 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7L V6 producing 305 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. The 3.5L was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.7L came with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and an optional 6-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciate the TL's smooth ride and strong engine performance. Some common complaints include the polarizing "beak" front-end styling, the somewhat dated interior design, and the less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption in the 3.5L V6 engine. This can manifest as the need to add oil between scheduled oil changes or low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks are recommended. If consumption is excessive, a leak-down test can help determine the source. Potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the source and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (3.5L V6)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing delayed or harsh shifting between gears, especially when the transmission is cold. This can also be associated with slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid change using Acura-specified fluid. If the problem persists, the solenoids or valve body may need to be inspected and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $1500+ (solenoid/valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (3.7L V6)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6-Speed Manual (3.7L V6)**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch wear is a natural part of manual transmission cars, but some owners have found that the clutch will wear down faster than expected.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch, pressure plate, and potentially the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual degradation of the struts/shock absorbers leads to leaks and diminished damping performance. This results in a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking struts/shock absorbers, preferably in pairs (front or rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (for a pair, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, or distorted audio during Bluetooth calls. The Bluetooth module may be failing.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If the issue persists, the Bluetooth module may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Navigation System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the navigation system, including outdated maps, slow response times, and system freezes.
    *   Solution: Update the navigation system software and maps. If the issue persists, the navigation unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, resulting in condensation. This can reduce headlight visibility and potentially damage the bulb or electrical components.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlight assembly and dry it thoroughly. Check and reseal the headlight housing to prevent future moisture intrusion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may stick, fail to open or close smoothly, or make excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the sunroof tracks and mechanism. If the problem persists, the sunroof motor or regulator may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Acura TL is a generally reliable vehicle. The most common issues revolve around oil consumption in the 3.5L engine, some transmission issues in the 5-speed automatic, and suspension wear. Electrical issues are less frequent. Repair costs range from relatively minor (fluid changes, lubrication) to more substantial (engine/transmission repairs, strut replacements). It's essential to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing problems before buying a used 2011 Acura TL.
