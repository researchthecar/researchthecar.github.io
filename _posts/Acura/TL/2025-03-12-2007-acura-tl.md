Engine issues can range from manageable oil leaks to more serious oil consumption problems, with repair costs varying accordingly. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can be costly to address. Suspension components are also prone to wear and tear. Electrical problems with the navigation system and door locks can be annoying, but typically not crippling.
