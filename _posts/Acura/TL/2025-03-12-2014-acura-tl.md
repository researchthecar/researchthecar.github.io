The 2014 Acura TL is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and upscale features. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 201 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The inline-4 was exclusively paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 came with a 6-speed automatic, with an optional 6-speed manual transmission available on the SH-AWD (Super Handling All-Wheel Drive) model. Owners generally appreciate the TL's smooth ride, spacious interior, and Acura's reputation for reliability. Common dislikes include the controversial styling (particularly the "beak" grille) on pre-refresh models, and the lack of some of the latest tech features compared to newer rivals.

**Summary**

The 2014 Acura TL, while generally reliable, has a few common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most prevalent engine issue is oil consumption in the 2.4L, while the 3.5L may experience VTEC solenoid gasket leaks. The 6-speed automatic transmission in the V6 can have torque converter issues. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and premature battery drain are also reported. Suspension noises and door lock actuator failures round out the list of common complaints. While not all TLs will experience these problems, being aware of them can help buyers make an informed decision and budget for potential repairs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences (like the VTEC gasket leak) to more significant and costly repairs (like torque converter replacement or infotainment system failure). Overall, the TL remains a decent vehicle, but pre-purchase inspections are recommended to catch potential problems early.
