The 1995 Acura TL, a mid-size luxury sedan, came with a single engine option: a 2.5L SOHC 20-valve G25A4 inline five-cylinder engine producing 176 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. It was exclusively paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the TL for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Honda reliability, while some criticisms included its somewhat bland styling and lack of more powerful engine options compared to competitors.

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly occur around the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. These leaks can lead to oil consumption, low oil levels, and potentially engine damage if left unattended. Visible oil spots under the car are common.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected gaskets and seals. Thoroughly clean the affected area to prevent future leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the location of the leak and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Distributor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The distributor can fail due to age and wear, causing misfires, rough running, difficulty starting, and eventually a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replace the distributor with a new or rebuilt unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Problems**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit slipping between gears, especially during acceleration, or shift harshly. This is often due to worn clutch packs or valve body issues.

**Summary**

The 1995 Acura TL, while generally reliable, can suffer from age-related issues typical of vehicles of that era. Engine oil leaks, transmission problems, suspension wear, and electrical gremlins are the most common concerns. Repair costs can range from relatively minor gasket replacements to more substantial expenses like transmission rebuilds. The severity of these issues can vary depending on the car's maintenance history and driving conditions. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the car for signs of these problems and factor in potential repair costs.
