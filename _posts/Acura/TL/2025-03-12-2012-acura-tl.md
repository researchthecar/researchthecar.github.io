The 2012 Acura TL is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and sporty handling. It came with two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7-liter V6 generating 305 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. The 3.5-liter engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.7-liter engine was available with either a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission on the SH-AWD (Super Handling All-Wheel Drive) model. Owners generally praise the TL for its comfortable interior, responsive handling (especially with SH-AWD), and Acura's reputation for reliability. Common complaints often revolve around the polarizing exterior styling (specifically the "beak"), the sometimes-firm ride (especially on models with larger wheels), and the lack of some advanced features compared to its competitors.
