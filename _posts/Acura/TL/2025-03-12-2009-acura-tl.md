The 2009 Acura TL marked the fourth generation of Acura's mid-size luxury sedan. It was available with two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7-liter V6 generating 305 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. The 3.5L V6 was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.7L V6 came with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission on the SH-AWD model. Owners often praise the TL for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong engine performance, especially with the SH-AWD model. Common dislikes include the controversial exterior styling (particularly the "beak"), and some concerns about electronic reliability.
