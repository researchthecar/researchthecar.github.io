The 2003 Acura TL is a front-wheel drive mid-size luxury sedan known for its reliability, sporty handling, and comfortable interior. It was available with a single engine option, a 3.2-liter V6 producing 270 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed automatic transmission or, in the Type-S model, a 5-speed automatic with Sequential SportShift. People generally like the car's styling, performance, and build quality, while common dislikes often revolve around the automatic transmission's reliability and some electrical issues.
