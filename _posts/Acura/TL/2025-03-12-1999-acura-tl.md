**Summary**

The 1999 Acura TL, while generally reliable, is showing its age. The most concerning issues relate to the transmission, which can experience slipping, harsh shifting, and even complete failure, potentially costing several thousand dollars to repair. Engine issues, like oil leaks and sensor failures, are also common. Electrical problems and suspension wear are typical for a vehicle of this age and can add to the overall maintenance costs. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making it essential to carefully inspect a potential purchase and factor in potential maintenance expenses. The transmission recall further highlights potential issues that should be addressed with careful pre-purchase inspection.
