Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2010 Acura TL, formatted as requested. The 2010 Acura TL was offered with two engine options: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 280 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7-liter V6 generating 305 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission (limited to the 3.7L engine with the SH-AWD trim). The TL was generally praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available all-wheel drive, while some disliked its somewhat polarizing exterior styling, particularly the "beak" grille, and the relatively complex infotainment system.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idling, and spark plug fouling, particularly in cylinders that are deactivated by the VCM system. This can lead to the "check engine" light illuminating with codes related to misfires.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using a VCM disabler device or replace piston rings. Replacing the affected spark plugs and cleaning the intake manifold may temporarily resolve symptoms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: VCM disabler ($100-$200), Piston ring replacement ($2,000-$4,000+), Spark plug replacement ($50-$200)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Judder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration while driving with the torque converter locked
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter, perform transmission fluid flush
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with oil consumption. The car requires more frequent oil changes, or the owner has to add oil in between oil changes.
    *   Solution: replace piston rings
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000-$4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both 3.5L and 3.7L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly when cold. Can also present as slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, replacement of faulty solenoids, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush ($100-$200), Solenoid replacement ($200-$500), Transmission rebuild/replacement ($2,500-$5,000+)

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking sounds, wandering steering, and uneven tire wear. Often caused by worn control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, or compliance bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings or entire control arms (depending on the severity and mechanic's recommendation).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing replacement ($100-$300 per bushing + labor), Control arm replacement ($300-$800 per arm, including labor)

**Summary**

The 2010 Acura TL has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly with the VCM system in the 3.5L V6, can lead to significant repair costs due to excessive oil consumption. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting in the 5-speed automatic, are also a concern. Electrical problems with the navigation/infotainment system can be frustrating. While not all 2010 TLs will experience these problems, it is essential to have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase and to be prepared for potential repairs. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from moderate to severe, and the cost to fix can vary widely depending on the specific problem and its extent.
