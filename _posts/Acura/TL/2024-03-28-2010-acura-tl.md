**Summary**

The 2010 Acura TL generally has a good reputation for reliability. However, some owners have reported issues with the intake manifold, timing chain, and valve springs on the engine, as well as transmission control module failures on the automatic transmissions. Suspension issues such as control arm bushing failures and shock absorber mount failures can also arise. Electrical problems like battery drain and alternator failures have been reported, and the vehicle may also experience sunroof leaks, power seat switch failures, headlight condensation, and fog light housing failures. The severity of these issues varies, but many can be expensive to repair, costing over $1,000 in some cases. It is important to note that not all owners will experience these issues, and the frequency of occurrence varies.
