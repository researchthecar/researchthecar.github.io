The 2008 Acura TL is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its reliability, sporty handling, and comfortable interior. The TL offers two engine options: a 3.2L V6 producing 258 horsepower and 233 lb-ft of torque, and a performance-oriented 3.5L V6 generating 286 horsepower and 256 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed automatic transmission (standard on the 3.2L) and a 6-speed manual transmission (available on the 3.5L). Owners often praise the TL for its smooth ride, responsive engine, and upscale features, but some common complaints include issues with the navigation system, excessive oil consumption (particularly on higher mileage models), and certain electrical glitches.
