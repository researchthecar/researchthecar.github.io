The 2000 Acura TL is a front-wheel-drive mid-size luxury sedan that was well-regarded for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability when new. The 2000 Acura TL came standard with only one engine, a 3.2L SOHC VTEC V6 engine, producing 225 horsepower and 216 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciated the TL's smooth engine and comfortable ride, common complaints revolved around transmission issues and some electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**3.2L SOHC VTEC V6 (J32A1)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often develop around the valve cover gaskets and the rear main seal as the car ages. Visible oil drips under the car or a burning smell may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets and/or the rear main seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for valve cover gaskets, $500 - $1000+ for rear main seal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing belt is a critical component, and if it fails, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, difficulty starting, or complete engine failure.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing belt, water pump, and tensioner. This is recommended every 7 years or 105,000 miles to prevent failure.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (preventative maintenance)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (BAXA)**

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A very common issue with this generation of TL is complete transmission failure. Symptoms include slipping gears, harsh shifting, or failure to shift at all. It is commonly known that the 2nd gear clutches fail due to design flaw that doesn't allow for adequate lubrication.
    *   Solution: Complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4500+
    *   Recalls:
        *   99V327000 (Recall Date: DEC 15, 1999): On certain passenger vehicles, the shift cable retainer was improperly manufactured. As a result, the retainer can crack and disengage from the transmission linkage. If this occurs, the driver may not be able to shift out of "park," or the driver may shift into "park" and the transmission may not be engaged. Either condition could cause a vehicle crash.
        *   04V176000 (Recall Date: APR 16, 2004): On certain passenger vehicles, the automatic transmission countershaft second gear may experience excessive wear and/or fracture under high load conditions. In the worst case, the gear could fracture, possibly resulting in seizure of the transmission. If this occurs while the vehicle is in motion at high speed, the vehicle could be placed in an uncontrollable state, which could result in a crash.

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shocks lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances. Noises, such as clunking, may be heard when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rubber bushings in the lower control arms can crack and wear out over time, leading to clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also affect the car's alignment.
    * Solution: Replacing the lower control arms or just the bushings (if possible).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side, depending on whether the entire control arm or just the bushings are replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working or move erratically. Often, this is due to a faulty window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Climate Control Display Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The digital display for the climate control system can become dim or completely fail, making it difficult to adjust the temperature and other settings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the climate control display unit or having it repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+, depending on repair vs. replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the rear quarter panels, rocker panels, and around the wheel wells, especially in areas with harsh winter climates.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, bodywork, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin through the sunroof, often due to clogged drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ if professionally cleaned.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2000 Acura TL, while praised for its comfort and luxury, has some significant issues to be aware of. The most severe and costly is the high rate of transmission failure, a known problem with this model year. Other issues, such as oil leaks and suspension wear, are common for vehicles of this age. While the electrical and interior issues are typically less severe, they can still be frustrating to deal with. The potential for high repair costs, especially concerning the transmission, makes a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing a 2000 Acura TL.
