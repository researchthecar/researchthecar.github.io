The 1992 Acura Vigor was a unique mid-size sedan slotting between the Integra and Legend in Acura's lineup. It was only available with one engine option, a 2.5L inline-5 cylinder engine producing 176 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual. Owners often praised the Vigor for its comfortable ride, distinctive engine sound, and generally good reliability for its time. Criticisms commonly centered on its unusual styling, tight rear seat, and relatively high price compared to competitors.

**Summary**

The 1992 Acura Vigor, while generally reliable, is showing its age, and many issues stem from wear and tear. The most common problems involve the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing relays or bushings to more costly repairs such as transmission rebuilds or rust repair. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase. The severity of these issues are moderate because the cars are old, but the cost can be potentially high because parts are not easy to find.
