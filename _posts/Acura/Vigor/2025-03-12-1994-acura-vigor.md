The 1994 Acura Vigor was a unique mid-size sedan that aimed to bridge the gap between the Acura Integra and the Acura Legend. It featured a longitudinally mounted inline 5-cylinder engine, a design choice not commonly found in other vehicles. The 1994 Vigor was only offered with one engine option, a 2.5L inline 5-cylinder engine producing 176 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally liked the Vigor for its distinctive engine sound, comfortable ride, and relatively sporty handling. Common dislikes included the somewhat unconventional styling (especially the rear end), limited rear seat space, and some reliability concerns associated with the engine.

**Summary:**

The 1994 Acura Vigor, while offering a unique driving experience with its inline-5 engine, suffers from typical issues associated with older vehicles. Engine oil leaks and distributor problems are common concerns, and the automatic transmission may exhibit shifting issues. Suspension wear, electrical problems, and rust are also prevalent. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the issue, ranging from minor gasket replacements to more significant expenses like transmission overhauls. While the Vigor can be a rewarding car to own, potential buyers should be prepared for potential maintenance and repair costs due to its age. The severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more serious problems that could affect the vehicle's reliability and safety.
