The 1993 Acura Vigor was a unique entry-level luxury sedan featuring a longitudinally mounted inline-5 cylinder engine, which set it apart from many competitors. The 2.5L inline-5 produced 176 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Vigor for its smooth engine, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. However, some common complaints included the car's somewhat cramped rear seat, the complexity of some of its systems, and the potential for specific issues related to the inline-5 engine design.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-5 (G25A)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly originate from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Ensure proper torque when tightening bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the leak location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Distributor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The distributor can fail, leading to misfires, rough running, and eventually a no-start condition. This is often due to a failing internal ignition control module or worn distributor bearings.
    *   Solution: Replace the entire distributor assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt needs to be replaced at regular intervals. Failure to do so can result in the belt snapping, leading to catastrophic engine damage due to the interference engine design.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, and tensioner at the recommended interval (typically every 60,000-90,000 miles).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping, delayed engagement, or harsh shifts, especially between gears 2 and 3. This can be caused by worn clutch packs or solenoid issues within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, rebuild or replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) to $1500 - $3000+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop. Can also cause poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Master Cylinder Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Soft clutch pedal, difficulty shifting, or clutch pedal sticking to the floor.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch master cylinder and bleed the system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps. Steering may feel loose or wander.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints, bushings, and potentially control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or groaning noises from the suspension, especially when turning. Reduced ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts and possibly the struts themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows moving slowly, erratically, or not at all. Clicking noises from the door when attempting to operate the window.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (per window)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Main Relay Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting problems, especially in hot weather. The car may crank but not start, or may start and then stall.
    *   Solution: Replace the main relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+

**Summary**

The 1993 Acura Vigor, while a comfortable and distinctive vehicle, is now quite old, so issues are going to become more prevalent with time.
