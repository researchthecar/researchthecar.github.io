**Introduction to the 1994 Acura Legend**

The 1994 Acura Legend was a luxury sedan that was known for its reliability, performance, and comfort. It was available with two engine options, a 3.2-liter V6 and a 2.7-liter V6, and two transmission options, a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual. The 3.2-liter V6 produced 230 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.7-liter V6 produced 170 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque.
