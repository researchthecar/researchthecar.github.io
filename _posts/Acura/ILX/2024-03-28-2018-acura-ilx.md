**Introduction:**

The 2018 Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan powered by a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine that produces 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard with a 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT), while a 6-speed manual transmission is available as an option. The ILX is praised for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and refined ride, but some owners have reported encountering various issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4-Cylinder**

* **Knocking Sound:** Some owners have reported hearing a knocking sound coming from the engine, particularly when accelerating or under load. This issue may be caused by excessive carbon buildup on the piston rings or valves. The solution typically involves cleaning the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Oil Consumption:** A small number of owners have noticed excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups. This may be due to worn piston rings or valve seals. Replacing these components can resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Occasional reports have been made of fuel injector failures, causing misfiring, rough idling, and reduced engine performance. Replacing the faulty injector typically restores normal operation. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $400+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed DCT**

* **Transmission Shudder/Vibration:** Some owners have experienced shuddering or vibration during gear shifts, especially at low speeds. This issue may be caused by worn clutch plates or solenoids. Adjusting or replacing the affected components may resolve the problem. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
* **Hesitation/Slippage:** Occasional reports have been made of transmission hesitation or slippage, particularly when upshifting. This may be due to a faulty torque converter or valve body. Replacing these components can restore smooth shifting. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Noise:** Some owners have reported a rattling or clunking noise coming from the front suspension, especially over rough road surfaces. This may be caused by worn strut mounts or bushings. Replacing the affected components typically eliminates the noise. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Rear Suspension Squeak:** Occasional reports have been made of a squeaking sound coming from the rear suspension. This may be due to worn bushings or sway bar links. Replacing the faulty components can resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Some owners have experienced rapid battery drain, even when the vehicle is not in use. This may be caused by a faulty module or electronic component. Identifying and replacing the affected part can resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
* **Electrical Short:** A few reports have been made of electrical shorts, causing blown fuses or intermittent electrical malfunctions. This issue may require extensive troubleshooting to identify the affected wiring or component. Estimated Cost to Fix: Variable, depending on the extent of the damage

**Exterior**

* **Wiper Motor Failure:** Some owners have reported intermittent or complete failure of the windshield wiper motor. This may be caused by a faulty motor or wiring harness. Replacing the affected components can restore wiper functionality. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Door Lock Malfunction:** Occasional reports have been made of door locks malfunctioning, either refusing to lock or unlock. This may be due to a faulty door lock actuator or wiring issue. Replacing or repairing the affected components can resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Seat Recliner Failure:** Some owners have reported issues with the power seat recliners becoming stuck or inoperative. This may be caused by worn gears or motors. Replacing or repairing the affected components can restore seat functionality. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $600+
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Occasional reports have been made of climate control malfunctions, such as inconsistent temperature regulation or fan speed issues. This may be caused by a faulty climate control module or sensors. Replacing the affected components can resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Summary:**

Overall, the 2018 Acura ILX has received generally positive reviews, with owners appreciating its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and refined ride. However, some owners have reported encountering various issues, ranging from engine knocking to transmission shudder and electrical problems. The severity and cost of these issues vary depending on the affected components and the extent of the problem. It's important to note that not all ILXs will experience these issues, and some may prove to be more reliable than others.
