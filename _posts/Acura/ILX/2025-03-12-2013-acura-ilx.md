The 2013 Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan that offered a blend of fuel efficiency, comfort, and Acura's reputation for reliability. It was available with three different powertrain options: a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing 150 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 201 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque paired with a 6-speed manual transmission (available only on the ILX 2.4L trim), and a 1.5L inline-4 hybrid engine producing 111 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque paired with a CVT transmission. Many owners appreciate the ILX for its fuel economy, comfortable ride, and upscale interior for the price point. Common complaints include the somewhat uninspired base engine performance, road noise, and a less-than-sporty driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2013 Acura ILX has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant problems appear to be related to potential CVT issues in the hybrid model and oil consumption in the 2.0L engine. Electrical issues like battery drain and condensation in the headlight housing could also require repairs. While some of these issues can be relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, such as CVT replacement, can be quite costly. It's advisable to have a thorough pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any potential problems before buying a used 2013 Acura ILX.
