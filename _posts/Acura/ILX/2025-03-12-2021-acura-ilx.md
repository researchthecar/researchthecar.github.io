The 2021 Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan known for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and relatively affordable price point within the Acura lineup. It comes standard with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the ILX for its value, fuel efficiency, and Acura's reputation for reliability. Common criticisms include its somewhat dated design and interior compared to newer competitors, and the lack of a more powerful engine option.

**Summary**

The 2021 Acura ILX generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but some owners have reported issues primarily related to the transmission, infotainment system, and exterior LED headlights. The transmission issues, though not widespread, can be the most concerning due to the potential cost of repair. The infotainment and LED headlight issues are less severe but can still be frustrating for owners. Overall, while potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints, the ILX remains a relatively dependable option in the compact luxury sedan segment.
