The 2016 Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and sporty handling. The standard engine is a 2.4-liter, direct-injected i-VTEC inline-4 producing 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Some owners appreciate the ILX for its comfortable ride, upscale interior, and Acura's reputation for dependability. Common criticisms include a somewhat dated design (considering it was refreshed in 2016), and that it is not as luxurious or spacious as some competitors.
