The 2022 Acura ILX is a compact sedan that offers a blend of luxury features and sporty handling. The sole engine option is a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. People generally appreciate the ILX for its reliability, comfortable interior, and Acura's reputation for dependability. Some common complaints include its dated infotainment system, less spacious rear seats compared to competitors, and perceived lack of significant updates over previous model years, which makes the value proposition questionable against newer or similarly priced rivals.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    * Solution: The oil consumption issue may stem from worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A temporary fix might involve using a thicker viscosity oil. However, the long-term solution typically requires replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

* **Rough Shifting or Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This can be accompanied by unusual noises or hesitation during gear changes.
    * Solution: A common fix involves performing a transmission control module (TCM) software update. In some cases, a transmission fluid change may also help alleviate the issue. For more severe cases, internal transmission repairs or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100-$200. Fluid change: $200-$400. Transmission repair or replacement: $3,000-$7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing or Lagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can sometimes freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This may require restarting the system or, in some cases, disconnecting and reconnecting the car battery to reset the electronics.
    * Solution: A software update to the infotainment system might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the head unit might need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $0 (if performed under warranty or recall). Head unit replacement: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling Noises in the Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported hearing rattling or buzzing noises coming from within the dashboard, particularly when driving on rough roads or at certain speeds.
    * Solution: Identifying the exact source of the rattle is crucial. This might involve disassembling parts of the dashboard to locate loose components or wiring harnesses. Securing these components with foam padding or other sound-deadening materials can resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ depending on the complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues include the sunroof failing to open or close properly, getting stuck, or producing unusual noises during operation.
    * Solution: Inspection of the sunroof tracks, motor, and related components is required. Lubricating the tracks, replacing a faulty motor, or repairing damaged linkages can resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,000+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Acura ILX generally shows good reliability. Most reported issues center around the infotainment system, transmission smoothness, and occasional interior rattles. The severity of these problems is generally moderate, but potential costs for repairs, particularly those involving the transmission or engine oil consumption, can be significant. Addressing these potential issues during a pre-purchase inspection is advisable.
