The 2019 Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan known for its reliability, sporty handling, and value proposition compared to its European rivals. It's offered with a single engine option: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). What people like about the ILX is its engaging driving experience, fuel efficiency, and Acura's reputation for dependability. Some common dislikes include its somewhat dated interior design, limited rear passenger space, and the DCT's occasional jerky behavior at low speeds.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 (K24W7)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption between oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than expected, low oil level warning lights, and potentially blue exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. In some cases, switching to a different oil viscosity or brand may help. More severe cases may require engine repairs such as piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (Piston Ring Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**

*   **Jerky Shifting at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DCT can exhibit jerky or hesitant shifting, particularly at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This can feel like a lurch or a delay when accelerating from a standstill.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer may help improve shift smoothness. In some cases, clutch replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (Software Update), $3,000 - $7,000+ (Clutch Replacement/Rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature failure of the front struts, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, excessive noise from the front suspension (clunking), and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected struts is the typical solution. It's generally recommended to replace struts in pairs (both front or both rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (per pair, including labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the car's battery draining overnight or within a few days of non-use. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery. This is typically a larger issue if aftermarket electrical modifications have been done.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the battery drain is necessary. Common culprits include a parasitic draw from a faulty sensor, a malfunctioning module, or an issue with the charging system. Battery replacement may also be necessary if the battery has been repeatedly drained.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (Diagnosis and Repair), $150 - $300 (Battery Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience various glitches, such as freezing, lagging, or unexpected reboots.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer may help resolve the issues. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (Software Update), $500 - $1500+ (Unit Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed condensation buildup inside the headlight housings. This can reduce headlight brightness and potentially damage the headlight components over time.
    *   Solution: In some cases, removing the headlight housing and drying it out can resolve the issue temporarily. A more permanent solution may involve resealing the headlight housing or replacing the affected headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Resealing), $300 - $800+ (Headlight Assembly Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattling/Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can develop rattles or squeaks, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the sunroof tracks and seals may help reduce the noise. In some cases, adjustments or repairs to the sunroof mechanism may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (Lubrication/Adjustment), $200 - $500+ (Mechanism Repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Acura ILX generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. The most notable concerns relate to the DCT's low-speed behavior, potential for excessive oil consumption, and some electrical and suspension problems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with some being relatively minor and easily addressed, while others may require more extensive repairs. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before making a purchase.
