### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Acura ILX generally demonstrates strong reliability, aligning with Acura's reputation. The powertrain components, including both the 2.0L and 2.4L engines and their associated transmissions (5-speed automatic and 6-speed manual), have not shown widespread significant issues. The suspension and exterior components also appear to be robust. However, owners have reported some electrical gremlins, primarily concerning the infotainment system's Bluetooth connectivity and backup camera functionality, as well as occasional failures with the keyless entry door handle sensors. The interior climate control system, specifically the A/C compressor, can also be a point of concern. While these issues are not pervasive, they represent the most common technical reliability concerns for this model year.
