**Introduction**

The 2015 Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and a 2.4-liter four-cylinder. The 2.0-liter engine produces 150 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.4-liter engine produces 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. Both engines come standard with a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

The ILX is praised for its comfortable ride, sharp handling, and fuel-efficient engines. However, it has been criticized for its lackluster acceleration, cramped interior, and uninspired design.

**Engine**

**2.0-Liter Four-Cylinder**

* **Transmission shudder:** This issue is characterized by a shuddering or vibration felt through the steering wheel, seat, or floorboard. It is most noticeable when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. The problem is caused by a faulty torque converter in the CVT transmission. The solution is to replace the torque converter. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** This issue can lead to a catastrophic engine failure. Symptoms include a rattling or ticking noise from the engine, reduced engine power, and a check engine light. The problem is caused by a defective timing chain tensioner that can fail and allow the timing chain to skip or break.

**Solution:** The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner and timing chain. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,500 - $4,000+

**2.4-Liter Four-Cylinder**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

* **Transmission shudder:** See 2.0-Liter Four-Cylinder Engine
* **Premature transmission failure:** This issue can occur in vehicles with high mileage or those that have been subjected to heavy towing or off-roading. Symptoms include slipping or shuddering, difficulty shifting gears, and a loss of power. The problem is caused by a variety of factors, including worn or damaged transmission components, a faulty torque converter, or a defective valve body. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $3,000 - $5,000+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** This issue can cause the battery to drain prematurely, leaving the vehicle unable to start. Symptoms include dim headlights, a weak horn, or a check engine light. The problem is often caused by a faulty alternator or a parasitic drain on the electrical system. The solution is to replace the alternator or trace and fix the parasitic drain. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard rattle:** This issue is characterized by a rattling or buzzing noise coming from the dashboard. The problem is caused by loose or improperly fitted interior components, such as the climate control vents or the center console. The solution is to identify and tighten or replace the loose components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $400+

**Summary**

The 2015 Acura ILX has a number of potential issues, including transmission shudder and failure, engine timing chain tensioner failure, and electrical problems. These issues can be costly to repair, so it is important to be aware of them before purchasing a used ILX. However, the ILX is generally a reliable vehicle with a comfortable ride, sharp handling, and fuel-efficient engines.
