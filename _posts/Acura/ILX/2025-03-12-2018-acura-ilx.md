The 2018 Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan known for its reliability, comfortable ride, and sporty handling. It came standard with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. The ILX is generally praised for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior for its class, and a long list of standard features. However, some owners find the infotainment system dated, and the rear seat space can be a bit tight for taller passengers.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled changes. Symptoms include the low oil level warning light illuminating or the owner noticing lower than expected oil levels on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The fix can range from changing the PCV valve to potentially replacing piston rings. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or jerky shifting, especially at lower speeds or during deceleration. This can manifest as a noticeable lurch or hesitation between gear changes.
    *   Solution: A software update (reprogramming the transmission control module - TCM) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, clutch pack replacement or valve body repair may be needed.

**Summary:**

The 2018 Acura ILX is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners have reported a few common issues. The most concerning issues involve the engine (excessive oil consumption) and transmission (harsh shifting), which can potentially lead to costly repairs. Other issues, such as infotainment system glitches and suspension problems, are less severe but can still be irritating. While most issues are not exceedingly common, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is recommended to identify potential problems early. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
