# 2022 Acura ILX

### Overview
The 2022 Acura ILX, while a competent entry-level luxury sedan, presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. It shares its platform with older Honda models, which contributes to a generally predictable maintenance profile. However, some specific areas have shown minor concerns that owners should be aware of. The powertrain, a carryover from previous generations, is largely robust, but attention to certain electrical components and interior materials is warranted. Overall, the ILX is considered a reasonably reliable vehicle, especially when compared to some of its more complex competitors, but it's not entirely immune to the occasional hiccup. Regular maintenance is key to ensuring its longevity.
