The 2014 Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan offering a blend of fuel efficiency, comfort, and Acura's reputation for reliability. The base model came with a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing 150 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. A more powerful 2.4L inline-4 engine, generating 201 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, was available and paired exclusively with a 6-speed manual transmission. A hybrid model was also available. Owners generally appreciate the ILX's comfortable ride, fuel economy, and upscale features for the price point. Common dislikes include the base engine's lack of power, some interior material choices, and the somewhat dated infotainment system.
