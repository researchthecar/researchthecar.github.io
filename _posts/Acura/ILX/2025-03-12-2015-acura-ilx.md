The 2015 Acura ILX is a compact sedan that offers a blend of luxury and practicality. It came with two primary engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, and a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Many owners appreciate the ILX for its comfortable ride, fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.0L), and Acura's reputation for reliability. Common complaints often revolve around the somewhat uninspired styling and interior compared to other luxury brands, and the perceived lack of excitement in the driving experience with the 2.0L engine, but the 2.4L helps deliver a more satisfying driving experience.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between changes. This can manifest as the low oil light illuminating, or noticing the oil level significantly reduced on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potentially switching to a different oil viscosity. In severe cases, engine component replacement (piston rings, valve seals) might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $3000+ (engine repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (2.0L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when shifting gears or a delay in response can also occur.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and replacement, or software update. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (2.4L Engine)**

*   **DCT Shudder/Roughness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted a shuddering sensation, particularly at low speeds or during initial acceleration from a stop. The transmission may also feel rough or hesitant when shifting.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM). Replacing the clutch pack can also resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software) - $2000+ (clutch replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspection of rear shock absorbers, bushings, and sway bar links. Replacement of worn or damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners experiencing a dead battery after the car has been sitting for a relatively short period (e.g., overnight or a few days).
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic drain by testing electrical components, replacing faulty battery, or replacing faulty component causing parasitic drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation and reduced visibility.

**Summary**

The 2015 Acura ILX has a variety of common issues that have been reported. The severity and cost can range from minor annoyances to more substantial repairs. The 2.0L engine has a history of excessive oil consumption, and the 5-speed transmission has issues with harsh shifting. The 2.4L engine and 8-speed DCT has issues with shuddering. Battery drain issues and suspension noises are also commonly reported. While not every ILX will experience these problems, it's wise for potential buyers to be aware of them and to have a thorough inspection performed before purchasing the vehicle.
