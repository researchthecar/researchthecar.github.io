**Summary**

The 2002 Acura RSX has some potential issues to be aware of, particularly with the engine and transmission. The piston slap issue on the manual transmission engine can be a major expense to repair. The CVT failure on the automatic transmission can also be costly. Other issues, such as suspension end links, electrical problems, and interior components, are generally less severe and expensive to fix. Overall, while the RSX is a great-handling and fun-to-drive car, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues before making a purchase.
