The 2005 Acura RSX is a sporty coupe appreciated for its handling, fuel efficiency, and Honda reliability, though some dislike its relatively stiff ride and road noise. The base model features a 2.0L inline-4 DOHC i-VTEC engine producing 160 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, while the Type-S boasts a more potent version of the same engine, delivering 201 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic on the base model, and a close-ratio 6-speed manual on the Type-S.

**Engine**

**2.0L i-VTEC (Base Model)**

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, particularly on cold starts, emanating from the top of the engine. This is due to wear in the Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VTC actuator. Some owners have reported temporary relief by performing multiple oil changes to flush out debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    * Solution: Could be caused by worn piston rings or valve seals. Repair typically requires engine disassembly and component replacement, or potentially a full engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+

**Summary**

The 2005 Acura RSX, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners should be aware of. The VTC actuator rattle is a common, albeit often minor, issue across both engine variants. Type-S models can experience more significant problems such as 6-speed transmission issues and excessive oil consumption. Suspension and electrical issues can also occur. Repair costs range from relatively inexpensive fixes like bulb replacements to potentially costly transmission or engine repairs. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to assess the condition of these key components.
