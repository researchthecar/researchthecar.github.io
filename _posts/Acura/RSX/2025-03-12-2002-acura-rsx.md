The 2002 Acura RSX is a sporty, front-wheel-drive coupe that replaced the Integra in Acura's lineup. It was available in two trims: the base RSX and the higher-performance RSX Type-S. The base RSX was powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine (K20A3) producing 160 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque. The Type-S boasted a more potent 2.0-liter inline-4 (K20A2) generating 200 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic for the base model, and a 6-speed manual for the Type-S. Owners generally praise the RSX for its fun driving dynamics, sporty styling, and reliability. Common complaints revolve around the relatively harsh ride, road noise, and some specific issues related to its age.
