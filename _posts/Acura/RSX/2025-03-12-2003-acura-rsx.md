**Summary**

The 2003 Acura RSX is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it has its share of common issues. The most concerning issues are related to the transmission, particularly the 6-speed manual in the Type-S, and potential catalytic converter failures. Suspension bushings and electrical problems such as window regulators and door lock actuators can also occur. Rust, particularly around the rear wheel arches, is another common concern. The cost to address these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major transmission or engine work. Addressing these issues when they are small will help avoid larger problems down the road.
