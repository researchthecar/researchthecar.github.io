The 2004 Acura RSX is a popular sport compact coupe known for its sporty handling, reliable Honda/Acura engineering, and stylish design. It came in two main trims: the base RSX and the higher-performance RSX Type-S. The base RSX was powered by a 2.0-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine producing 160 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Type-S packed a more potent 2.0-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine generating 200 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque, exclusively mated to a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciate the RSX for its engaging driving dynamics, fuel efficiency, and overall dependability. Common complaints often revolve around road noise, a somewhat stiff ride, and the age-related issues inherent in a vehicle of this vintage.

**Engine**

**2.0L i-VTEC (K20A3) - Base RSX**

*   **VTEC Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and lack of power at higher RPMs. This is due to a failure in the VTEC solenoid that is unable to regulate the oil pressure and activate the high RPM cam profile.
    *   Solution: Replace the VTEC solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L i-VTEC (K20A2) - RSX Type-S**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual increase in oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between changes. Blueish smoke from the exhaust may be visible in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, possible solutions range from using a heavier weight oil to piston ring replacement or complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (heavier oil) - $2,000+ (engine rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, stalling, and difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual - Base RSX**

*   No Issues Found

**5-Speed Automatic - Base RSX**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips between gears, especially during acceleration, or experiences harsh, jerky shifts. This can be caused by worn clutch packs or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid change may temporarily alleviate the issue. A more permanent fix often involves a valve body rebuild or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual - RSX Type-S**

*   **2nd and 3rd Gear Grinding/Pop-Out**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noise when shifting into 2nd or 3rd gear, particularly at higher RPMs. The transmission may also pop out of gear. This is caused by wear to the synchros.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild with replacement of the affected synchros and potentially other worn parts (gears, shift forks).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. The rear of the car may feel unstable or wander.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or creaking noise from the suspension, especially when turning the steering wheel or going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (for all four corners)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window operates slowly or not at all. Grinding noise may be heard when operating the switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Multiplex Integrated Control System (MICU) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic behavior of electrical components like interior lights, power locks, or security system. Can also cause battery drain.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to confirm MICU failure, followed by replacement or reprogramming of the MICU unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Quarter Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust bubbles forming on the rear quarter panels, particularly around the wheel wells. This is a common issue in areas with salted roads.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including cutting out the rusted metal, welding in new metal, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement (expensive) or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (dashboard cover) - $1,000+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Acura RSX, while a generally reliable vehicle, does have some common issues owners may encounter. Engine issues like VTEC solenoid failure and oil consumption (especially in the Type-S) can be costly to address. The 6-speed manual transmission in the Type-S is susceptible to synchro wear, leading to grinding and pop-out issues. Suspension components like trailing arm bushings and strut mounts can wear out and require replacement. Electrical issues, such as power window regulator failure and MICU problems, can also occur. Finally, rust on the rear quarter panels is a common cosmetic concern. Overall, many of these issues are age-related and repair costs can vary greatly depending on the severity and the chosen repair method.
