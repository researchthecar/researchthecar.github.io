### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Acura RSX is a solid choice for a sporty and reliable compact car, particularly if equipped with the manual transmission. The K-series engines are generally robust, though the Type-S model can exhibit oil consumption issues as mileage increases. Manual transmissions are typically durable, but clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Automatic transmissions are less common and can develop leaks. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are typical wear items for a car of this age and mileage. Electrical issues are generally minor, with power window motors and alternators being the most frequently cited. Interior wear on seats is also common. Overall, the RSX offers good reliability, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
