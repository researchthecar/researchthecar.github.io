**Introduction:**

The 2006 Acura RSX is a compact sports coupe that offers a thrilling driving experience. It features a high-revving 2.0-liter engine that produces 200 horsepower and 142 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a 6-speed manual transmission, the RSX delivers sharp handling and impressive acceleration. Despite its performance capabilities, the RSX also offers a comfortable and well-appointed interior. However, like any vehicle, it has some common issues that potential owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.0L K20A3**

* **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption is a common issue on the K20A3 engine. It can be caused by worn piston rings, valve seals, or valve guides. Symptoms include low oil levels, increased oil consumption, and blue smoke from the exhaust. Fixing this issue requires an engine rebuild or replacement, which can cost $2,000 - $5,000+.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail prematurely, leading to skipped timing and engine damage. Symptoms include a ticking or rattling noise from the engine, poor performance, and illuminated check engine light. Replacing the timing chain tensioner and timing chain typically costs $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **VTC Solenoid Failure:** The variable timing control (VTC) solenoid can fail, causing the engine to run poorly and illuminate the check engine light. Replacing the VTC solenoid typically costs $200 - $500+.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Synchronizer Wear:** Synchronizers in the manual transmission can wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting gears, especially into second and third gear. Replacing the synchronizers requires a transmission rebuild, which can cost $1,500 - $3,000+.
* **Dual Mass Flywheel Failure:** The dual mass flywheel can fail, causing a rattling noise and vibrations during acceleration. Replacing the flywheel typically costs $1,000 - $1,500+.

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure:** The rear shock absorbers can fail prematurely, causing a rough ride and poor handling. Replacing the rear shock absorbers typically costs $600 - $1,200+.
* **Front Control Arm Bushings Wear:** The front control arm bushings can wear out, causing clunking noises and poor handling. Replacing the bushings typically costs $200 - $400+.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail prematurely, leading to a loss of electrical power and illuminated dash warning lights. Replacing the alternator typically costs $400 - $600+.
* **Battery Failure:** The battery can fail prematurely, especially in extreme cold or hot temperatures. Replacing the battery typically costs $150 - $250+.

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Leaks:** The sunroof drains can clog, causing water to leak into the interior. Fixing this issue requires cleaning or replacing the sunroof drains, which can cost $200 - $500+.

**Interior**

* **Power Window Failure:** The power window motors or switches can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Replacing the motors or switches typically costs $200 - $500+.
* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure:** The HVAC blower motor can fail, causing a lack of airflow from the vents. Replacing the blower motor typically costs $300 - $500+.
* **Instrument Cluster Failure:** The instrument cluster can fail, causing the gauges and displays to become inoperable. Replacing the instrument cluster typically costs $500 - $1,000+.

**Summary:**

The 2006 Acura RSX is a fun-to-drive sports coupe with a few potential issues. The most severe and expensive issues include oil consumption on the K20A3 engine, timing chain tensioner failure, and transmission synchronizer wear. While many of the issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, potential owners should be aware of these potential problems before purchasing a used RSX.
