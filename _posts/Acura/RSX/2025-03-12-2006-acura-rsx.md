The 2006 Acura RSX is a sporty coupe known for its handling, reliability, and fuel efficiency. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 141 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC inline-4 (K20Z1) producing 201 horsepower and 143 lb-ft of torque, found in the Type-S model. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic (for the base model), and a close-ratio 6-speed manual (for the Type-S). Owners generally appreciate the RSX's sporty handling, relatively low running costs, and Honda reliability. Common dislikes include road noise, a somewhat firm ride, and the lack of some modern features.

**Summary**

The 2006 Acura RSX, while generally reliable, has a few common issues to watch out for. Engine issues like valve cover leaks and oil consumption (especially on the Type-S) can occur. Transmission issues, particularly with the manual gearbox (grinding, popping out of gear), can be costly to address. Suspension wear, electrical problems, and rust are other potential concerns. Overall, while some repairs can be expensive, many of these issues are age-related and manageable with proactive maintenance and repairs.
