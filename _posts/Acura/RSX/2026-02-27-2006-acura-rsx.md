### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Acura RSX is a generally reliable vehicle with a strong mechanical foundation. Common issues tend to be related to age and mileage, such as oil leaks, suspension wear, and some electrical components like power window regulators and alternators. The manual transmission is typically robust, though third gear synchros can be a point of concern. Automatic transmissions may exhibit shifting issues over time. Exterior paint, particularly the clear coat, can degrade. Interior components like the HVAC resistor are also known failure points. Despite these potential issues, the RSX remains a desirable car for its performance and handling, with most problems being repairable and not indicative of systemic design flaws.
