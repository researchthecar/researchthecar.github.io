**Introduction**

The 2019 Acura TLX is a midsize luxury sedan available in two engine and transmission options: a naturally aspirated 2.4-liter 4-cylinder and a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. The 4-cylinder engine produces 206 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, while the V6 produces 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.

The TLX's strengths include its sharp handling, responsive acceleration, and premium interior. However, it has been criticized for its firm ride, small trunk, and lack of rear-wheel drive.
