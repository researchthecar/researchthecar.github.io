The 2024 Acura TLX is a stylish and sporty sedan that aims to blend luxury with performance. It's offered with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 272 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 making 355 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the TLX for its attractive design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some criticisms include a somewhat cramped rear seat and infotainment system complexity.
