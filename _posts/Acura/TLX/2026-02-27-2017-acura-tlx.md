# 2017 Acura TLX

### Overview
The 2017 Acura TLX is generally considered a reliable vehicle, offering a good balance of performance, luxury, and technology for its class. It was available with two distinct powertrain options: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and a more powerful 3.5-liter V6 engine coupled with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Both powertrains aim to deliver a refined driving experience. The TLX also features a well-appointed interior and a suite of modern safety and infotainment features. While most owners report positive experiences, like any vehicle, some common areas of concern have been noted, particularly related to the transmission and certain electronic components, though widespread critical failures are not prevalent.
