The 2018 Acura TLX is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, sporty handling (especially with the V6 and SH-AWD), and a good blend of luxury and value. The TLX came with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 206 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT), and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. A significant number of owners appreciate the vehicle's reliability, fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder), and standard features. However, some common complaints include infotainment system issues, particularly with the dual-screen setup, and occasional transmission quirks, especially with the earlier versions of the 9-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 (8-Speed DCT)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled changes.
    *   Solution: Acura issued a service bulletin addressing oil consumption issues in some of its vehicles. The solution typically involves software updates to the ECU, and in more severe cases, replacement of piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on the severity and if a replacement of engine components is necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 (9-Speed Automatic)**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable vibrations at low speeds or during light acceleration, particularly when the VCM system engages and disengages, switching between 6 and 3 cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with software updates or disabling the VCM system via aftermarket devices or tuning. While these methods can alleviate the vibrations, they might impact fuel efficiency.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $300+ (for aftermarket VCM disabler or tuning).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed DCT (2.4L Inline-4)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Jerky Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of rough shifting, particularly at low speeds or during initial acceleration. The dual-clutch transmission can exhibit jerky engagement in certain driving conditions.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) can often improve shift quality. In rare cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (for software update), $1,500 - $3,000+ (for clutch replacement, if needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**9-Speed Automatic (3.5L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting and Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh shifting, particularly between lower gears, and hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating. Some owners describe a "clunking" sensation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) are the most common fix. In some cases, valve body replacement has been reported.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (for software update), $1,000 - $2,500+ (for valve body replacement, if needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dual-screen infotainment system can experience freezing, lagging, or unresponsiveness to touch inputs. This can affect navigation, audio controls, and other features.
    *   Solution: Software updates can often improve the system's performance. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update, if available), $500 - $1,500+ (for infotainment unit replacement, if needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera system.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connection and wiring for damage, try replacing the camera, or recalibrating the camera settings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the failure.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **LED Headlight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: LED headlights may flicker, dim, or completely fail prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ per headlight assembly, depending on the side and if it's OEM or aftermarket.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises from Dashboard/Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels while driving, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: The fix can vary depending on the source of the noise. It may involve tightening loose trim pieces, adding padding or insulation to prevent vibration, or replacing damaged clips or fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+, depending on the severity and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Acura TLX has some common issues. The severity varies depending on the specific problem, but powertrain issues (transmission and potential oil consumption) can be costly. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system and occasional exterior issues with headlights are other common complaints. Overall, the 2018 Acura TLX is considered a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and check for related symptoms during a pre-purchase inspection.
