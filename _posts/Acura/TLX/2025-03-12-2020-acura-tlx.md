Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2020 Acura TLX, formatted for your website.

The 2020 Acura TLX is a stylish and sporty sedan offering a blend of luxury and performance. It came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 206 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 delivering 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, while the V6 was mated to a 9-speed automatic. Owners often praise the TLX for its comfortable ride, responsive handling, and upscale interior. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated infotainment system and the sometimes-clunky operation of the 9-speed transmission.
