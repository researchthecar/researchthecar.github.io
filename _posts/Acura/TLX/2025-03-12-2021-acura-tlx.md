The 2021 Acura TLX marked a significant redesign for the model, introducing a more aggressive and sporty aesthetic, improved performance, and updated technology. It offered two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 272 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine producing 355 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the TLX for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and engaging driving dynamics. Some common criticisms include the infotainment system's learning curve and occasional reports of electronic glitches.
