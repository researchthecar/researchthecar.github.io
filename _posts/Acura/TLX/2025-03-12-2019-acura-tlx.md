The 2019 Acura TLX is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and available technology. The TLX offers two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 206 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L is paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, while the 3.5L comes with a 9-speed automatic. Owners often praise the TLX for its handling and value proposition, but some dislike the infotainment system and perceived reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: The common solution is to inspect the PCV valve for failure. Replacing the piston rings may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for PCV valve replacement. $2,000+ for piston ring replacement.

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper System (ADS) Malfunctions (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Error messages related to the ADS system, ride quality issues (excessive stiffness or bounciness). The ADS system can fail, leading to a loss of adaptive damping.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the ADS system to identify the faulty component (damper, sensor, or control module). Replacement of the faulty part is required.
