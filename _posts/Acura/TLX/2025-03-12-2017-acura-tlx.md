The 2017 Acura TLX is a mid-size sedan that offers a blend of luxury, performance, and reliability. It was available with three powertrain options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 206 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT); a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission; and the same 3.5-liter V6 engine with all-wheel drive. Owners often praise the TLX for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and responsive handling. Some common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired styling (prior to the mid-cycle refresh), the infotainment system's learning curve, and the occasionally clunky behavior of the 8-speed DCT.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Engine (8-Speed DCT)**

*   **DCT Shudder/Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported shuddering, jerky acceleration, and harsh shifts, especially at lower speeds. This is often more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A software update can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, a transmission replacement might be needed.

**Summary**

The 2017 Acura TLX has a mix of minor and more significant potential issues. The most serious concerns are related to the 8-speed DCT on the 2.4L engine and the 9-speed automatic on the V6, with potential for costly repairs. Electrical issues and VCM vibrations are less severe but still noteworthy. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used TLX before purchase, paying particular attention to transmission performance and electrical system functionality. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
