The 2015 Acura TLX is a mid-size sedan that marked Acura's attempt to streamline its lineup by replacing both the TL and TSX models. Available engine options included a 2.4L inline-4, and a 3.5L V6. The 2.4L engine produced 206 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5L V6 generated 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. The TLX was generally praised for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and ample features for the price. Common complaints included a somewhat uninspired driving experience (especially with the 2.4L engine), and some initial issues with the 9-speed automatic transmission in the V6 models.
