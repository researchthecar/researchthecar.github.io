The 2016 Acura TLX is a mid-size sedan offering a blend of luxury and performance. The engine options include a 2.4L Inline-4 producing 206 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, while the 3.5L comes with a 9-speed automatic. People appreciate the TLX for its comfortable ride, upscale interior, and advanced technology features. Common complaints include the sometimes-jerky transmission behavior (particularly the 8-speed DCT) and infotainment system glitches.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Direct Injection Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, rough idling, misfires, and decreased fuel economy. This is due to carbon deposits forming on the intake valves, common with direct injection engines.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Timing Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine hesitation, rough idling, check engine light. Could result from faulty variable timing solenoid.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty variable timing solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch (DCT) (Paired with 2.4L)**

*   **Jerky Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, especially at low speeds. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop. Can also cause transmission slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (Software Update), $1500 - $3000+ (Clutch Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**9-Speed Automatic (Paired with 3.5L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Gear Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable harsh shifts between gears, especially during acceleration. Gear slippage when trying to accelerate, causing the engine RPM to flare.
    *   Solution: Software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM). Transmission fluid change. In more severe cases, transmission replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (Software Update), $150 - $300 (Fluid Change), $3000 - $6000+ (Transmission Replacement)

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure, requiring frequent jump-starts.
    *   Solution: Identify the parasitic draw on the battery (often a faulty module or relay) and replace the defective component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, particularly in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement.

**Summary**

The 2016 Acura TLX has some notable issues. The transmission issues, especially with the DCT, can be irritating. The infotainment problems and battery drain can be frustrating and result in trips to the mechanic. Dashboard Cracking can occur. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix (software updates, solenoids), others like transmission or dashboard replacements can be costly. Overall, while the TLX offers a luxurious experience, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and issues.
