### Overview
The 2015 Acura TLX, a luxury sports sedan, generally offers a strong reliability record, reflecting Acura's reputation for building durable vehicles. It was available with two distinct powertrain options: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) and a more potent 3.5-liter V6 engine mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. Both powertrains aim to balance performance and fuel efficiency. The TLX is known for its comfortable ride, refined interior, and advanced technology features for its time. While most owners report a positive ownership experience, like any vehicle, some specific areas have seen occasional reports of issues that are worth noting for potential buyers or current owners.
