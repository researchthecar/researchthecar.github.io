**Introduction**

The 2018 Acura TLX is a midsize luxury sedan that offers a balance of style, performance, and comfort. It comes equipped with a choice of two engine options: a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 and a 3.5L V6. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). The TLX is praised for its sharp handling, responsive steering, and comfortable interior.
