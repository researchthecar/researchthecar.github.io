# 2016 Acura TLX

### Overview
The 2016 Acura TLX is generally considered a reliable vehicle, offering a good balance of performance, comfort, and technology. It was available with two distinct powertrain options: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) and a more powerful 3.5-liter V6 engine mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. Both powertrains aim to provide efficient yet engaging driving experiences. The TLX's design focuses on a premium feel, with a well-appointed interior and modern exterior styling. While most owners report positive experiences, like any vehicle, some specific areas have seen occasional reports of issues that are important for potential buyers and current owners to be aware of.
