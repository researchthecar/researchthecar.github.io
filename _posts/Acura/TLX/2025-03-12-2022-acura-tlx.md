The 2022 Acura TLX is a luxury sedan known for its sporty handling, stylish design, and comfortable interior. It's available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 272 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 producing 355 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the TLX's sharp styling, engaging driving dynamics, and the value it offers compared to its German rivals. Some common criticisms include the somewhat cramped rear seating and the infotainment system, which, while improved from previous Acura systems, still takes some getting used to.
