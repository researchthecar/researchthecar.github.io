The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Limited, essentially a rebadged version of the previous generation Malibu, offered a blend of practicality and value. While not as stylish or technologically advanced as the newly redesigned 2016 Malibu, the Limited appealed to buyers seeking a dependable and affordable mid-size sedan. It primarily came equipped with a 2.5L inline-4 engine producing 196 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers liked the Malibu Limited for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and straightforward controls. Common complaints centered around the dated design, lack of advanced safety features compared to newer models, and some reliability concerns.
