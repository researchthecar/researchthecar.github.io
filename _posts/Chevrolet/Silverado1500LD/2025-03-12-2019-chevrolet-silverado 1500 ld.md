Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LD (Limited), formatted as requested. The 2019 Silverado 1500 LD is essentially the 2018 Silverado 1500 carried over for one final model year while the redesigned 2019 Silverado 1500 (K2XX) was being sold alongside it. Because of this, it utilizes the older generation's engine and transmission options. The Silverado 1500 LD came with three engine choices: a 4.3L V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). It was also available with two transmissions: a 6-speed automatic, and an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Silverado 1500 LD for its familiar design, comfortable ride, and capable performance. Some criticisms include the dated interior, fuel economy (particularly with the larger engines), and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder head. Some owners choose to disable AFM completely during the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warnings, visible exhaust smoke (blueish in color), the need to frequently add oil between oil changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV valve can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV) - $5,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or incorrect oil pressure readings on the instrument cluster, check engine light, potential for engine damage if true oil pressure is low.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illuminated. Often caused by a failed lifter due to the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder head. Some owners choose to disable AFM completely during the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warnings, visible exhaust smoke (blueish in color), the need to frequently add oil between oil changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV valve can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV) - $5,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable clunking or jerking during gear changes, especially when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration (reprogramming) of the transmission control module (TCM). If that fails, valve body replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (recalibration), $500 - $1,500 (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable clunking or jerking during gear changes, especially when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration (reprogramming) of the transmission control module (TCM). Fluid Flush with updated Mobil Dexron HP fluid. If that fails, valve body replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (recalibration), $100-$200 (fluid flush), $500 - $1,500 (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibration or shudder felt at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. Can feel like driving over rumble strips.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush with updated Mobil Dexron HP fluid. In more severe cases, torque converter replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 (fluid flush), $800 - $2,000 (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noise coming from the rear suspension when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Applying lubricant to the leaf spring bushings or replacing the bushings. In some cases, the leaf springs themselves may need to be replaced if they are worn or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (lubrication/bushing replacement), $300 - $800 (leaf spring replacement per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LD has a mix of potential issues that buyers should be aware of. The most concerning and potentially costly issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system leading to lifter failure, and excessive oil consumption in the engines. The 8-speed transmission can also present problems with harsh shifting and shuddering. Electrical glitches like infotainment issues and backup camera failures are also common. Interior components like the dashboard and seat heaters can also have issues. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive (e.g., sensor replacement, fluid flush), others, such as engine or transmission repair/replacement, can be very costly. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to assess the condition of these critical components.
