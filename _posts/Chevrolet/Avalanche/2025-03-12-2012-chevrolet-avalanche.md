The 2012 Chevrolet Avalanche is a unique full-size pickup truck that combines the functionality of a truck with the comfort of an SUV. All 2012 Avalanches came equipped with a 5.3L Vortec V8 engine, producing 320 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6L80E 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Avalanche's versatile midgate system, which allows the cargo bed to be extended into the cabin. However, some common complaints include the Avalanche's large size, fuel economy, and some reliability concerns as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**5.3L Vortec V8 (LMG/LC9/LY5)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, engine misfires, and potential damage to the catalytic converter. The AFM system can cause lifter failure, leading to these issues. Ticking or knocking noises from the engine may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters, potentially replace the camshaft if damaged, and disable the AFM system by installing a non-AFM camshaft and reprogramming the ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or inaccurate oil pressure readings on the dashboard gauge. The "Check Engine" light may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor. Access can be difficult, sometimes requiring intake manifold removal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Potential for stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,800+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, especially when cold. Can also experience slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Initially, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may improve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,500+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Autoride System Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, rough ride quality, and error messages on the dashboard related to the Autoride system. Air compressor failure or leaks in the air shocks are common causes.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air shocks, compressor, or any leaking air lines. Consider converting to a traditional coil spring suspension if repairs are too costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Loose steering and uneven tire wear can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, or lights. The BCM controls many of the vehicle's electrical functions.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the BCM for any faults and reprogram or replace it as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges stop working or provide inaccurate readings. The entire cluster may intermittently shut off.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. Some shops specialize in rebuilding these clusters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Midgate Seal Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin or cargo bed area, particularly during heavy rain. The seals around the midgate may degrade over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the midgate seals. Ensure proper alignment and sealing during installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, often due to sun exposure and temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the entire dashboard is the most effective solution, though costly. A dashboard cover can be used as a temporary fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Avalanche, while offering unique versatility, presents several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine-related problems, particularly with the AFM system, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially those related to the torque converter, are also prevalent. Electrical gremlins linked to the BCM and instrument cluster can be frustrating. Finally, ensure to check the Autoride system and midgate seal. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars. A thorough inspection and a comprehensive pre-purchase inspection are recommended before purchasing a used 2012 Avalanche.
