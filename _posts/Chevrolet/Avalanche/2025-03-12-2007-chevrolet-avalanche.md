The 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche is a unique vehicle that blends the comfort of a crew-cab pickup truck with the versatility of a bed that can be expanded into the cab. It offered a few engine options: a 5.3L V8 producing 320 horsepower and 340 lb-ft of torque and the 6.0L V8, generating 367 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Avalanche's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and innovative Midgate system. Common dislikes include fuel economy, overall size, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and a ticking noise, particularly when the engine is warm. This issue is caused by the AFM lifters collapsing, preventing the affected cylinders from firing.
    * Solution: Replace the failed AFM lifters, often along with the head gasket and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be caused by worn piston rings or issues related to the AFM system.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the oil consumption. If piston rings are the culprit, the engine may need to be rebuilt or replaced. If AFM is the cause, disabling the system might help reduce oil consumption.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, particularly when the engine is cold, that diminishes as the engine warms up. This is often caused by broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks.
    * Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts. This can sometimes be a difficult repair, as the bolts can be seized or break off inside the cylinder head.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty oil pressure sensor readings or complete failure, trigger the check engine light, and lead to incorrect information being displayed on the instrument panel.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60-E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly.
    *   Solution: In many cases, replacing the valve body, shift solenoids, or performing a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, particularly when accelerating, or a complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter, often along with a transmission flush and filter change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Autoride System Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Autoride system, which uses electronically controlled shocks, can fail, leading to a rough ride and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs). The air compressor can also fail.
    * Solution: Replace the failed shocks or air compressor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per shock, $300-$800 for the compressor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of ball joints, tie rod ends, and idler arms. This can lead to loose steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster, including gauges not working properly.
    * Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks not working properly, either failing to lock or unlock with the remote or door switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate or operating slowly and erratically.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Midgate Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cab when the Midgate is closed.
    * Solution: Replacing the Midgate seals or adjusting the Midgate alignment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Bed Cover Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bed cover panels warping, cracking, or becoming difficult to remove or install.
    * Solution: Replacing the damaged bed cover panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HVAC blower motor only working on certain speeds, or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical problems to more significant engine and transmission concerns. Engine issues like AFM lifter failure and oil consumption can be costly to address. The 4L60-E transmission is known to have some issues with harsh shifting, but the fixes are generally affordable. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
