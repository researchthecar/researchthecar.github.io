**2008 Chevrolet Avalanche**

The 2008 Chevrolet Avalanche is a versatile full-size pickup truck that offers a combination of capability and comfort. It is available with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The 5.3L V8 engine produces 319 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, while the 6.0L V8 engine produces 366 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque.
