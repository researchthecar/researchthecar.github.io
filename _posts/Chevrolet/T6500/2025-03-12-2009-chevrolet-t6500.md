**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet T6500, while a capable medium-duty truck, experiences common issues associated with commercial vehicles. Engine issues with the Duramax diesel often involve fuel injectors and the EGR cooler, which can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, primarily related to the Allison automatic, include torque converter and shift solenoid failures, also resulting in significant repair expenses. Suspension and electrical issues, such as leaf spring problems and wiring harness damage, are also common. Overall, prospective buyers should be prepared for potential maintenance costs and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's condition before purchase.
