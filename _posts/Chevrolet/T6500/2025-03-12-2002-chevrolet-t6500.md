Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2002 Chevrolet T6500, structured as requested.

The 2002 Chevrolet T6500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications. Engine options included the 6.6L Duramax Diesel, the 7.8L Caterpillar 3126, and the 8.1L Vortec gas engine. It was generally liked for its reliability and versatility for various applications, but disliked for its stiffer ride and higher maintenance costs compared to lighter-duty trucks. The 6.6L Duramax produced approximately 300 horsepower and 520 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include Allison automatic transmissions and manual transmissions, depending on the configuration.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Diesel (LB7)**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Injectors are prone to failure, leading to rough running, misfires, white smoke, and decreased fuel economy. This issue was more prevalent in the early LB7 engines.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors. The entire set is often replaced to ensure balanced performance and prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel in Oil**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking injectors can cause fuel to enter the engine oil. This thins the oil, reducing its lubricating properties and potentially causing engine damage. Symptoms include rising oil level, fuel smell in the oil, and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors. Change the engine oil and filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+ (including injector replacement and oil change)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.8L Caterpillar 3126**

*   **HEUI (Hydraulic Electronic Unit Injector) Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HEUI pump, responsible for providing high-pressure oil to the fuel injectors, is known to fail. Symptoms include hard starting, rough running, lack of power, and stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the HEUI pump. Diagnose and replace any damaged injectors as a result of the pump failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sticking or malfunctioning EGR valves can cause poor engine performance, black smoke, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. Check and clean the EGR cooler if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec Gas**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can be a common issue with the 8.1L Vortec, often attributed to worn valve seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: A compression and leak-down test can help pinpoint the source of the oil consumption. Repair or replace the affected components (valve seals, piston rings, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks in the intake manifold gasket can cause vacuum leaks, resulting in rough idling, poor performance, and possible check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison Automatic (1000/2000 Series)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause slippage, shuddering, and a complete loss of power transfer.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Inspect and flush the transmission cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning shift solenoids can lead to erratic shifting, hard shifting, or a failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty shift solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Manual Transmissions**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, and clutch pedal sticking are common signs of clutch failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. Consider replacing the flywheel as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the leaf springs can sag or crack, leading to a rough ride, reduced load capacity, and uneven vehicle stance.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn shocks or struts can cause excessive bouncing, poor handling, and reduced ride comfort.
    *   Solution: Replace the shocks/struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to age and exposure to the elements, the wiring harness can become brittle and corroded, leading to electrical shorts and malfunctions.
