The 2000 Chevrolet T6500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial purposes such as delivery, construction, and utility work. It was available with a variety of engine options including the 5.7L gasoline V8, the 6.0L gasoline V8, the 7.4L gasoline V8, and the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8. Horsepower and torque varied depending on the specific engine. The transmissions were typically manual or automatic, based on the specifications of the buyer when it was ordered. Owners often appreciated the T6500's workhorse capabilities, its ability to handle heavy loads, and its relatively simple design for maintenance. Common dislikes include the basic interior, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the age of these vehicles now makes finding parts difficult.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2000 Chevrolet T6500, being a medium-duty truck of that age, is prone to various issues related to wear and tear. Engine issues such as leaks, knocking, and fuel injector problems are common, depending on the engine configuration. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are also likely to wear out, affecting ride quality. Electrical problems like alternator failure and wiring harness issues can also occur. Rust is a major concern on the exterior. Interior issues are typically limited to HVAC malfunctions. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, with repairs potentially ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, especially for major engine or transmission work. Due to the age of the vehicle, finding replacement parts may also pose a challenge.
