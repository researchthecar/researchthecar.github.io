### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet T6500 demonstrates reasonable reliability for a commercial vehicle, with its powertrains generally being robust. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to wear items on the suspension and specific electrical components like alternators and wiring harnesses, which are not uncommon for trucks of this age and duty cycle. Engine-specific problems, such as injector issues on the Caterpillar and EGR cooler leaks on the Isuzu, are notable but often manageable with timely maintenance. Transmission issues, particularly with torque converters in automatics and clutch wear in manuals, are also present. Overall, the T6500 is a capable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential repair costs associated with these specific components, especially if the vehicle has high mileage or has been subjected to severe operating conditions.
