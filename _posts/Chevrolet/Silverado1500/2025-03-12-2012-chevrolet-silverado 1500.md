The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its reliability, capability, and comfortable ride. Available engine options include a 4.3L V6 (195 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.8L V8 (302 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (315 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L V8 (403 hp, 417 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options consist of a 4-speed automatic (primarily with the V6 and some 4.8L V8 models) and a 6-speed automatic (standard with the 6.2L V8 and available with the 4.8L and 5.3L V8s). Owners generally appreciate the Silverado's strong performance, smooth ride, and spacious cabin. Common dislikes include the fuel economy of the larger engines and some reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**
*   **No Issues Found**

**4.8L V8**
*   **No Issues Found**

**5.3L V8**
*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, and potential for complete engine failure. This is due to the AFM system deactivating cylinders to improve fuel economy, which can lead to premature wear and failure of the lifters and camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters and camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Often associated with the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with piston ring replacement or disabling the AFM system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Can sometimes be resolved with a fluid flush and filter replacement. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary, or a full transmission rebuild.

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a generally reliable truck, but some common issues can arise. The most significant concerns revolve around the 5.3L V8's Active Fuel Management system, which can lead to lifter failure and oil consumption. Transmission issues, particularly with the 6-speed automatic, can also be problematic. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely. Lifter failures can be very expensive due to possible catastrophic damage.
