### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is generally a reliable truck, with its V6 and larger V8 engines (excluding the 5.3L's AFM lifter concern) and 6-speed transmission proving quite durable. The primary areas of concern are the Active Fuel Management system in the 5.3L EcoTec3 engine, which can lead to costly repairs, and some reports of harsh shifting or torque converter issues with the 8-speed automatic transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Exterior and interior components are largely robust, with minor issues like tailgate latches and power seat motors being the most common. Overall, it's a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine and transmission options and their associated potential problems.
