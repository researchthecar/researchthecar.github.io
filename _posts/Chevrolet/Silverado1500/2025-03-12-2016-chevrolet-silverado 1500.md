The 2016 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, strong towing capabilities, and refined interior (on higher trims). Available engines included a 4.3L V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options consisted of a 6-speed automatic and an 8-speed automatic (paired with the 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines in some configurations). Owners often praise the Silverado for its reliability and capability. However, some common complaints include issues with the automatic transmissions, particularly the 8-speed, and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**
*   **No Issues Found**

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, and potentially the camshaft if damaged. Many owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 5.3L V8 engines experience excessive oil consumption. Owners may notice a low oil level warning or need to add oil frequently between oil changes.
    *   Solution: GM released a technical service bulletin (TSB) addressing this issue, which involves re-designing the valve cover and installing a new air/oil separator. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and required repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L V8, the 6.2L V8's AFM system can also lead to lifter failure, resulting in similar symptoms (ticking, knocking, misfires).
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and possibly the camshaft. AFM delete is a common preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80)**
*   **No Issues Found**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8L90 transmission is known for experiencing harsh shifting, shuddering, and clunking, especially during low-speed driving and gear changes. Some people have also reported that the issue will occur in the higher gears.
    *   Solution: GM released multiple TSBs addressing this issue, recommending a transmission fluid flush with a revised fluid (Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP) and a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush and software update) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **"Chevy Shake"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibration felt primarily in the steering wheel and seat, particularly at highway speeds. This can be caused by a number of issues, including out-of-balance tires, warped rotors, or drivetrain issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the vibration is crucial. Balancing tires, replacing warped rotors, or addressing drivetrain components (such as the driveshaft) may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the vibration)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can experience glitches, including freezing, black screens, unresponsive touchscreens, and Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the infotainment system module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracking Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard in some 2016 Silverado 1500 models can develop cracks, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cracked dashboard or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $1,000+ (depending on whether you fix yourself with a cover or have the entire dash replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, while generally a reliable truck, has some notable issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 8-speed automatic transmission, particularly its harsh shifting and shuddering. The AFM system on the 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines can lead to costly lifter failures. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system and dashboard cracking are also reported. While some issues can be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes like fluid flushes or software updates, others, such as lifter failure or transmission replacement, can be quite expensive. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
