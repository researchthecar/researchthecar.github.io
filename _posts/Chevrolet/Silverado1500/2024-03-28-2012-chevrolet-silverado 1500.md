**Vehicle Introduction:**

The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a full-size pickup truck offered with several engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 4.3L V6 with 195 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Other engine choices include a 5.3L V8 with 315 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.2L V8 with 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic, a 6-speed automatic, and a 6-speed manual. Drivers appreciate the Silverado's spacious interior, powerful engines, and impressive towing and payload capacities. However, some owners have reported various issues with the vehicle.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Causes coolant leaks, overheating, and performance issues. Solutions include replacing the gasket, which costs around $100-$300, or repairing the intake manifold itself, which is more expensive.
* **Valve cover leaks:** Oil leaks from the valve covers, leaving a residue on the engine. The repair involves replacing the valve cover gaskets, costing approximately $100-$200 for parts and labor.

**5.3L V8**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter failure:** Lifters become damaged or worn, causing reduced engine power, ticking noises, and misfires. Replacing all lifters and related parts can cost around $2,000-$4,000.
* **Oil consumption issues:** Some engines consume excessive oil, requiring frequent top-ups. The issue can be caused by various factors, including piston ring wear or valve guide problems. Repairs can range from $1,000 to over $5,000.

**6.2L V8**

* **Excessive exhaust fumes:** The exhaust system may develop leaks, causing exhaust fumes to enter the cabin. Replacing the exhaust manifold or other components can cost anywhere from $500 to $2,000.

*Recalls:* None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Slipping or harsh shifting:** The transmission may not engage gears properly or shift smoothly. The issue can sometimes be resolved by changing the transmission fluid and filters, or it may require more extensive repairs such as replacing the transmission solenoids or clutches, costing around $1,000-$2,000.

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift flare or hesitation:** The transmission hesitates or flares up during gear shifts. Fixing the issue usually involves reprogramming the transmission control module or replacing the torque converter, which can cost between $500-$1,500.
* **Transmission failure:** The transmission may experience complete failure, requiring a full replacement. This major repair can cost upwards of $5,000.

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch problems:** The clutch may become worn or damaged, leading to difficulty engaging gears or transmission noise. Replacing the clutch assembly typically costs around $1,000-$2,000.

*Recalls:* None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension noise:** Creaking or clunking noises may come from the front suspension, especially while driving over uneven surfaces. The issue is often caused by worn or damaged ball joints or control arms. Replacing these components can cost between $500-$1,000 per side.
* **Rear axle seal failure:** The rear axle seals may fail, causing leaks. Replacing these seals can cost around $200-$400 for parts and labor.

*Recalls:* None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery may discharge prematurely, leaving the vehicle unable to start. Issues can include faulty electrical components, such as a bad alternator or parasitic drain. Diagnosing and resolving electrical problems can be complex, with costs varying depending on the issue.
* **Power window failure:** The power windows may become inoperable, either intermittently or permanently. Replacing the window motors or switches can cost approximately $300-$500 per window.

*Recalls:* None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight condensation:** Moisture may accumulate inside the headlights, causing visibility issues. The issue can be resolved by replacing the headlight assemblies, which may cost around $500-$1,000 per headlight.

*Recalls:* None Found

**Interior**

* **Air conditioning issues:** The air conditioning system may not cool the interior effectively, causing discomfort. Common causes include refrigerant leaks, compressor failures, or evaporator problems. Repairs can range from $500 to over $1,000.
* **Dashboard squeaks or rattles:** Noises may come from the dashboard or other interior panels, especially while driving over rough roads. The issue can be resolved by applying sound-deadening materials or tightening loose components, which is usually a minor repair.

*Recalls:* None Found

**Summary:**

The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has experienced a variety of issues, including engine lifter failures, transmission problems, suspension noise, electrical drain, and interior noises. The severity and cost of repairs vary depending on the specific issue. It is important to note that not all vehicles will experience these problems, and the overall reliability of the Silverado is still considered to be good.
