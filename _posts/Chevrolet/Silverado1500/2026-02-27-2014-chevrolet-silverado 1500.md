## Engine

### 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (L83)
**Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter issues**
- **Symptoms:** Engine misfires, rough idle, potential for lifter failure leading to internal engine damage.
- **Solution:** Replacement of lifters, camshaft, and potentially other internal components. Some owners opt for AFM disablation kits.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,500

**Oil consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning between changes, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis may involve checking PCV system, piston rings, and valve seals. Repair costs vary widely depending on the cause.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,000


### 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (L86)
**Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter issues**
- **Symptoms:** Engine misfires, rough idle, potential for lifter failure leading to internal engine damage.
- **Solution:** Replacement of lifters, camshaft, and potentially other internal components. Some owners opt for AFM disablation kits.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,500

**Oil consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning between changes, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis may involve checking PCV system, piston rings, and valve seals. Repair costs vary widely depending on the cause.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,000


### 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 (LV3)
**Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter issues**

### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 generally offers good reliability, particularly for its core mechanical components. The EcoTec3 engines, while powerful and efficient, have a known susceptibility to issues related to the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, specifically lifter wear and oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. The 6-speed automatic transmissions are mostly reliable, though some instances of torque converter shudder and harsh shifting have been reported. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are not uncommon but are typically manageable. Exterior and interior components are generally robust. Prospective buyers should be aware of the potential AFM-related engine issues and factor in possible maintenance or repair costs associated with this technology.
