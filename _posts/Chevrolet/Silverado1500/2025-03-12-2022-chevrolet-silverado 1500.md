The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a full-size pickup truck offering a wide range of engine options, including a 2.7L Turbo High-Output inline-4 (310 hp, 430 lb-ft torque), a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft torque), and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel inline-6 (277 hp, 460 lb-ft torque). Transmission options include an 8-speed automatic (paired with the 2.7L Turbo and some 5.3L V8s) and a 10-speed automatic (paired with the 3.0L Duramax, 6.2L V8, and some 5.3L V8s). Owners often praise the Silverado for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin (especially in crew cab configurations), and strong towing capabilities. However, some common complaints include the perceived lack of refinement in certain interior materials and some reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**2.7L Turbo High-Output**

*   **Piston Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine knocking, loss of power, misfires, and potential complete engine failure. Some reports suggest piston ring land failures are the root cause, leading to excessive oil consumption and eventual engine damage.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $7,000 - $9,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and a "check engine" light. Diagnostic codes often point to cylinder deactivation issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM/DFM delete kits are also used as a preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+

**Summary**

The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, while generally a reliable truck, has some notable issues. Engine problems, particularly AFM/DFM lifter failures and piston failures in the 2.7L engine, are among the most serious and expensive to address. Transmission issues, though less severe, can still cause frustration. Electrical and interior problems, like infotainment glitches and seat heater failures, are more common but typically less costly to repair. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider extended warranties or thorough inspections before purchasing.
