The AFM lifter issue can be quite severe, potentially leading to engine damage and costly repairs. Electrical problems, while not as catastrophic, can be annoying and require diagnosis. Rust is also a common concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the truck for these issues and factor in potential repair costs.
