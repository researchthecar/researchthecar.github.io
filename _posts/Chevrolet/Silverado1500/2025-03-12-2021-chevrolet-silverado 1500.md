**Engine**

**2.7L Turbo I4**

*   **Piston Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Piston failure can occur due to excessive pre-ignition or detonation. Symptoms can include a knocking noise from the engine, reduced power, misfires, and potentially catastrophic engine damage. Affected pistons are often cracked or have holes burned through them.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the damaged pistons and potentially the entire engine, depending on the extent of the damage. Some cases have been resolved with a software update to address the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise, misfires, and a rough idle.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters, which often requires removing the cylinder head. Some owners opt to delete the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacement of valve cover, piston rings, valve seals, or PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, the AFM system can lead to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise, misfires, and a rough idle.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters, which often requires removing the cylinder head. Some owners opt to delete the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6**

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catastrophic failure of the CP4 high-pressure fuel pump can occur. Symptoms include fuel starvation, loss of power, and potential engine damage due to metal debris circulating in the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the HPFP, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and fuel tank, as metal debris can contaminate the entire fuel system. Some owners are opting for CP3 pump conversions for increased reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (paired with 5.3L, 6.2L, and 3.0L Duramax)**
