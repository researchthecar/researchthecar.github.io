The 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 marked the start of the fourth generation of the Silverado. It was available with a range of engines including a 2.7L Turbo I4 (310 hp, 348 lb-ft of torque), a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6 (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 6-speed automatic, 8-speed automatic, and 10-speed automatic, depending on the engine configuration. Owners generally liked the Silverado's updated styling, comfortable ride, and available technology. However, some common complaints centered around the initial quality, particularly concerning the fit and finish of interior components, and some reliability issues with certain engine and transmission combinations.

**10-Speed Automatic (10L80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 8-speed, but may also include hesitation during acceleration or delayed shifts.
    *   Solution: Software update, valve body replacement, or in some cases, full transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $5,000+ (major repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
