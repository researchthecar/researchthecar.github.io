The 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a popular full-size pickup truck, known for its comfortable ride, strong towing capabilities, and available technology features. The 2015 Silverado came with several engine and transmission options. Engine choices included a 4.3L V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). The 4.3L V6 and the 5.3L V8 came standard with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 6.2L V8 was paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission later in the model year (October 2014) and was also optional on the 5.3L V8. Owners generally appreciate the truck's smooth ride and quiet cabin, but some have reported issues with the automatic transmission, particularly with the 8-speed. Some owners dislike the interior materials, finding them less premium than some competitors.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, misfires, and potential engine damage due to AFM system failing. AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can cause problems when lifters fail to reactivate.
    *   Solution: Disable the AFM system with a tuner or install an AFM disabler device. Replacement of faulty lifters and potentially the camshaft may be required in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, misfires, and potential engine damage due to AFM system failing. AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can cause problems when lifters fail to reactivate.
    *   Solution: Disable the AFM system with a tuner or install an AFM disabler device. Replacement of faulty lifters and potentially the camshaft may be required in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, poor fuel economy, and potential check engine light activation. Fuel injectors may become clogged or fail completely.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found
**6.2L V8**
*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear and 2nd and 3rd gear, shuddering, hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Some have had success with transmission fluid flushes using an updated fluid formulation (Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP), software updates, or in more severe cases, replacement of the torque converter or valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **"Chevy Shake"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration, typically felt in the steering wheel or seat, at highway speeds (around 65-75 mph). Can be caused by multiple issues, including out-of-balance tires, driveshaft issues, or faulty torque converter.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause (tire balance, driveshaft balance, U-joints, torque converter) and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, black screen, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, volume control problems.

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, while a popular truck, has exhibited some notable issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system leading to excessive oil consumption across multiple engine configurations, and the 8-speed automatic transmission (8L90) with its rough shifting. The "Chevy Shake" vibration issue can also be a persistent and frustrating problem. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and backup camera are also common. The severity and cost of these issues vary greatly, from relatively inexpensive software updates to potentially costly engine or transmission repairs. Addressing these potential problems proactively through maintenance or preventative measures like AFM disablers can mitigate the risk of more significant repairs down the line.
