The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, strong towing capabilities, and a range of available trims and features. It offers several engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 producing 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque. A mid-range option is the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, generating 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. The top-tier engine is a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8, delivering 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. These engines are typically paired with a 6-speed or 8-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often praise the Silverado's spacious cabin, user-friendly infotainment system, and overall reliability. However, common complaints include issues with the automatic transmission, particularly hard shifting and shuddering, as well as concerns about the quality of some interior materials.

**Engine**

**4.3L EcoTec3 V6**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illuminated. Often caused by the AFM lifters collapsing, preventing proper valve operation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of failed lifters, often recommended to replace all lifters and potentially the camshaft.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.3L V6, symptoms include engine misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light. AFM lifters fail due to design flaws and oiling issues.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty lifters, consider deleting the AFM system during the repair for improved long-term reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable oil consumption between oil changes, often exceeding acceptable levels. May lead to fouled spark plugs and catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Revised valve cover with improved PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system, piston ring replacement (more extensive repair).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (PCV valve and valve cover) - $3,000+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.3L and 5.3L, symptoms include engine misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light. AFM lifters fail due to design flaws and oiling issues.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty lifters, consider deleting the AFM system during the repair for improved long-term reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable oil consumption between oil changes, often exceeding acceptable levels. May lead to fouled spark plugs and catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Revised valve cover with improved PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system, piston ring replacement (more extensive repair).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (PCV valve and valve cover) - $3,000+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Specifically with 5.3L engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Slipping can occur, where the engine revs without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Software re-flash of the transmission control module (TCM). If the issue persists, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (re-flash) - $3,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **"Chevy Shake" / Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, particularly at low speeds or during light acceleration. Often described as "driving over rumble strips." Primarily affects trucks equipped with the 8L90 transmission.
    *   Solution: Multiple TSBs issued, including transmission fluid flush with updated fluid (specifically Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP), and in some cases, torque converter replacement or full transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (fluid flush), $1,000 - $3,000+ (torque converter/transmission)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 6-speed, rough or jerky shifting and potential slipping between gears. Can occur in various gears.
    *   Solution: Software re-flash, valve body replacement, or full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (re-flash) - $3,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **"No Issues Found"**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, lags, or becomes unresponsive. Can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Software update, replacement of the infotainment system module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (update) - $500+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Backup camera displays a black screen, distorted image, or fails to activate.
    *   Solution: Check wiring connections, replace the camera unit.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has a number of potential issues to be aware of. The most significant are related to the AFM system in the engines, leading to potential lifter failures and the 8-speed transmission issues. The engine issues can be costly to repair. The transmission shudder, while not always causing complete failure, can be irritating and requires a specific fluid flush, although other repairs can be much more expensive. Interior issues such as dashboard cracks are also common and require a significant repair. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have any prospective purchase thoroughly inspected.
