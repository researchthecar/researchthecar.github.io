**Introduction**

The 2012 Chevrolet Captiva Sport is a midsize SUV that offers a spacious cabin and a comfortable ride. It is powered by a choice of two engines: a 2.4L Ecotec 4-cylinder engine that produces 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine that produces 264 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Captiva Sport is available in both front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive configurations.
