The 2010 Chevrolet Captiva Sport was a compact SUV offered in a single trim level and was primarily targeted towards fleet sales. The 2010 Captiva Sport came equipped with a 2.4L Inline-4 engine producing 169 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Captiva Sport for its affordability and fuel efficiency. Common complaints included the bland interior, lack of available features compared to competitors, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, engine knocking, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may help reduce oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to rough running, a check engine light, and potential engine damage. Common symptoms include rattling noises, especially upon start-up.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid/filter), $800-$1500 (valve body), $2,500 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure often presents with shuddering during acceleration or while maintaining speed, particularly at lower speeds. May also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and clunking noises from the suspension. Uneven tire wear can also be an indicator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per axle (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is parked for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identifying the parasitic drain source (e.g., faulty relay, aftermarket accessory) and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Lock Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working, or power locks fail to respond.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor, lock actuator, or associated wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window/door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly or resealing the existing housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per headlight (depending on replacement vs. resealing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system blows warm air, or the blower motor stops working.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the issue (e.g., refrigerant leak, compressor failure, blower motor resistor) and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Display Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio or infotainment display malfunctions, freezes, or loses power.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Chevrolet Captiva Sport exhibits several common issues, primarily related to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. The excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues with the 2.4L engine can be costly to address. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting and torque converter failure, are also prevalent. Electrical issues, like battery drain and power accessory failures, can be inconvenient. The overall severity of these issues ranges from moderate to severe, with repair costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing.
