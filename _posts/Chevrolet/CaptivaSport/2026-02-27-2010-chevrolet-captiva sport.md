### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Chevrolet Captiva Sport exhibits some common reliability concerns, particularly within its engine and transmission systems. The 2.4L and 3.0L engines have reported issues with oil consumption and timing chain wear, respectively, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission can also develop problems like harsh shifting and torque converter issues. Suspension components like struts and control arm bushings are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as power window motors and infotainment system glitches, along with exterior issues like sunroof leaks, are less frequent but still present. While not universally problematic, potential buyers should be prepared for potential maintenance and repair costs associated with these known issues, especially on higher mileage examples.
