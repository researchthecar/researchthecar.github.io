The 2012 Chevrolet Captiva Sport was a compact SUV offered in a single trim level and primarily marketed towards fleet customers. It's essentially a rebadged Saturn Vue. The 2012 Captiva Sport came standard with a 2.4L Inline 4 engine producing around 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.  People generally appreciate the Captiva Sport for its relatively low price point and decent fuel economy for its class. Common complaints revolve around its somewhat bland interior, lack of modern features compared to competitors, and some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline 4 (LE5)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.4L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil light illuminating, engine knocking, and potentially engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: The problem is usually due to worn piston rings, PCV valve failure, or valve stem seal degradation. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the cause. The common fix for excessive oil consumption is to replace the piston rings, valve seals, and possibly the PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing chain on the 2.4L engine can stretch or fail prematurely, especially if proper maintenance (regular oil changes) is neglected. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, check engine light with codes related to timing, and potential engine misfires or stalling.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain, sprockets, tensioner, and guides is the solution. It is recommended to also inspect and potentially replace the camshaft actuator solenoids while performing this repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ depending on shop rates and if other parts are needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T40/45)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6T40/45 transmission can exhibit harsh or erratic shifting, especially between certain gears. Slipping during acceleration or a noticeable delay in engagement is also reported.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may provide temporary relief in some cases. However, the issue often stems from internal wear or valve body issues requiring removal, inspection, and replacement. If the problems are severe, a full transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $2,500 - $4,500+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can manifest as shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop or while maintaining a steady speed. Other symptoms can include stalling and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter is the standard fix. Often, damage from the failing torque converter can contaminate the transmission fluid and potentially damage other internal transmission components, so a thorough inspection is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+ depending on the extent of damage and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the suspension bushings, particularly those in the control arms and stabilizer bar links, wear out relatively quickly. This leads to clunking noises, sloppy handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings is the solution. In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm assembly rather than just the bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per corner depending on the parts replaced and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure of power windows and door locks is a somewhat common complaint. Windows may stop working or move erratically, and door locks may fail to lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: The problem can be caused by a faulty window motor, door lock actuator, wiring harness issues in the door jamb, or a failing Body Control Module (BCM). Diagnosis involves checking power and ground to the affected components and testing their functionality. Replacement of the faulty component(s) is the fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per window/door, depending on the specific issue and part replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience unexplained battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can result in a dead battery and difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: This issue can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or an aftermarket accessory. Diagnosis involves using a multimeter to measure the current draw while the vehicle is off and systematically disconnecting circuits to isolate the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty door actuators or aftermarket remote start.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue and the part replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning systems may fail to blow cold air, blow warm air intermittently, or make strange noises.
    *   Solution: Common causes include low refrigerant due to leaks, a faulty compressor, a malfunctioning blend door actuator, or a clogged cabin air filter. Diagnosis involves checking refrigerant levels, testing compressor function, and inspecting the blend door actuator. Replacement of the faulty component(s) and recharging the system is the fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the issue and the parts replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Captiva Sport can be a decent value for those seeking an affordable SUV, but it's important to be aware of its potential issues. The most common complaints revolve around the engine, particularly excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues with the 2.4L engine. Transmission problems, electrical glitches, and suspension bushing wear are also reported. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to significant repairs, with repair costs varying widely depending on the specific problem and shop rates. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and review its maintenance history before purchasing.
