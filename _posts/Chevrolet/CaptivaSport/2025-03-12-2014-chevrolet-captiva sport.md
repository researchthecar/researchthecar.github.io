The 2014 Chevrolet Captiva Sport was a compact SUV primarily marketed to fleet customers. It came standard with a 2.4L Inline-4 engine that produced 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A key selling point was its affordability, but some owners found the interior materials and overall refinement lacking. Common complaints revolved around engine issues, electrical problems, and limited features compared to other SUVs in its class. Many enjoyed its fuel efficiency and relatively spacious cargo area for its size.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 (LE9)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms may include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust (though not always present), and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Potential solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive repairs like piston ring replacement. A leak-down test can help determine the source of the consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) - $2000+ (Piston Rings)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain may stretch or fail, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and a check engine light with codes related to timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, and potentially other related components like the tensioner and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T40/45)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or harsh shifting between gears, particularly when cold. Slipping during acceleration, or difficulty shifting into gear are also common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported success with transmission fluid changes (using the correct Dexron VI fluid). However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Fluid Change) - $3000+ (Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with premature wear on suspension components, such as ball joints, tie rod ends, and struts/shocks. Symptoms can include clunking noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components. An alignment is recommended after any suspension work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the components replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of batteries draining overnight or within a few days, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component. This may involve testing various circuits and modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the door lock actuators, preventing doors from locking or unlocking properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch may be difficult to open or close, or the latch mechanism may fail completely.
    *   Solution: Adjustment or replacement of the hatch latch and/or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor may stop working, resulting in no air flow from the vents. This can be due to a faulty blower motor, resistor, or wiring.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor or resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Captiva Sport, while an affordable option, has a few common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and timing chain problems can lead to costly repairs. Electrical problems such as battery drain and faulty door lock actuators are also prevalent. While not every Captiva Sport will experience these issues, a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are recommended before purchase. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the issue and the extent of the damage.
