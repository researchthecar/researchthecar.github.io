### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Chevrolet Captiva Sport presents a mixed reliability profile. Owners should be particularly aware of potential issues with the turbocharged engine's PCV system and turbocharger, as well as the V6 engine's timing chain and intake manifold. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear prematurely. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are another concern. Exterior rust, especially in wheel arches, and interior HVAC blend door actuator failures are also reported. While not universally problematic, these areas represent the most common technical reliability concerns for this model year.
