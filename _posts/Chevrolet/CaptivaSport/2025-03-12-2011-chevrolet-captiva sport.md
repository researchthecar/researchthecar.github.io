The 2011 Chevrolet Captiva Sport was primarily marketed towards fleet customers, often serving as a rental vehicle. It offered a practical and affordable transportation solution, but it wasn't without its drawbacks. The Captiva Sport came with a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing around 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers generally appreciated the Captiva Sport's spacious interior and fuel economy; however, its unrefined ride quality, bland styling, and some reliability concerns were frequent criticisms.

**Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners reported high oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between changes. Some experienced engine knocking or potential engine damage if oil levels weren't monitored closely.
    * Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from using a higher-viscosity oil, replacing valve stem seals, or, in more extreme cases, replacing the piston rings or entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (higher-viscosity oil) - $3000+ (engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or break, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage if the chain fails completely. Often accompanied by a rattling noise, especially on startup.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Purge Valve Solenoid**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. Transmission slipping can also occur, causing a delay in acceleration.
    * Solution: This may involve a transmission flush, solenoid replacement, or valve body repair. In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush) - $3500+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, especially when under load. May also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during turns, and increased stopping distances. Premature tire wear can also occur.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000 (per axle)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Stabilizer Bar Links**

**Summary**

The 2011 Chevrolet Captiva Sport faces several common issues, with engine problems (particularly excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues) being among the most concerning due to their potential for significant repair costs. Transmission issues can also be expensive to address. While suspension and electrical problems are generally less costly, they can still impact the vehicle's drivability and reliability. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any Captiva Sport before purchasing, paying close attention to engine oil levels, transmission performance, and any unusual noises. Addressing the vehicle's A/C problems can also cause the cost of vehicle ownership to increase significantly.
