The 2008 Chevrolet Captiva Sport, also known as the Saturn Vue in some markets, was a compact SUV that aimed to provide a balance of practicality and affordability. The 2008 Captiva Sport was primarily aimed at fleet sales. Engine options included a 2.4L Ecotec Inline-4 producing around 169 hp and 161 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 3.6L High Feature V6 generating approximately 264 hp and 222 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed automatic transmission with the 4-cylinder engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission paired with the V6. Owners generally appreciated its affordability and spacious interior for its class. Common dislikes centered around the base engine's performance and the overall build quality compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil light illumination and potential engine damage if oil levels are not monitored and maintained.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and using a heavier weight oil may temporarily mitigate the issue. The root cause could be worn piston rings or valve seals, which may require engine repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and repair method
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L High Feature V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L V6 engine is known for potential timing chain wear or failure. Symptoms may include a rattling noise upon startup, rough idling, and a check engine light. Failure to address this issue can lead to significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chains, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.4L Ecotec)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting between gears, especially during acceleration. Transmission may slip, causing a temporary loss of power.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change may help in minor cases. In more severe situations, the transmission may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 3.6L High Feature V6)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations, especially at lower speeds or during acceleration. The torque converter may fail to lock up properly, leading to reduced fuel efficiency and potential transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. In some cases, a transmission flush may temporarily alleviate symptoms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride quality, excessive body roll during turns, and clunking noises from the suspension. Struts and shocks may leak fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**

**Summary**

The 2008 Chevrolet Captiva Sport is subject to a range of potential issues, primarily related to the engine and transmission, and to a lesser extent, the suspension and electrical systems. Engine-related problems such as excessive oil consumption (2.4L) and timing chain issues (3.6L) can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, including harsh shifting and torque converter problems, are also noteworthy. While some issues like worn suspension components are typical for a vehicle of this age, addressing them promptly is essential for safety and ride quality. Electrical glitches and interior trim concerns may add to the overall cost of ownership. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect any used Captiva Sport before purchase, paying particular attention to engine and transmission health.
