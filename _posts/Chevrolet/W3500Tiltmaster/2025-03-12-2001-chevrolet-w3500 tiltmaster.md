The 2001 Chevrolet W3500 Tiltmaster is a cab-over-engine (COE) medium-duty truck commonly used for commercial applications like delivery, landscaping, and construction. This model year typically came with either a 5.7L V8 gasoline engine producing around 270 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque or a 7.3L Isuzu 4HE1-TC diesel engine, known for its durability, producing around 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission was typically an Aisin A450 four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission (Isuzu). Owners often praise the Tiltmaster for its maneuverability in urban environments, ease of maintenance due to the tilting cab, and robust build quality. However, common complaints include a rough ride, dated interior, and the relatively high cost of parts and specialized service compared to light-duty trucks.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2001 Chevrolet W3500 Tiltmaster is a workhorse, but its age means that many of the common issues stem from wear and tear. Engine and transmission problems, particularly in the diesel models, can be costly, especially fuel injector and turbo failures. Suspension issues also contribute to maintenance expenses. While rust is a significant concern in some regions, the interior issues are less critical. Owners should be prepared for potentially high repair costs associated with these vehicles, especially if neglected maintenance is evident.
