The 2002 Chevrolet W3500 Tiltmaster is a cab-over-engine (COE) truck designed for commercial use, offering a compact footprint for maneuverability in urban environments. It was offered with both Isuzu diesel engines and GM gasoline engines. The Isuzu 4HE1-TC 4.8L diesel engine produces around 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the Tiltmaster's ease of maintenance due to the tilting cab, while others dislike the ride quality and noise levels associated with COE designs.
