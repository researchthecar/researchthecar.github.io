The 2006 Chevrolet W3500 Tiltmaster is a cab-over-engine (COE) truck designed for commercial use, often used for delivery services, landscaping, and other vocational applications. It's known for its maneuverability and relatively tight turning radius, making it suitable for urban environments. What owners often appreciate is its ease of access for maintenance and its functional, if somewhat spartan, interior. Drawbacks often include ride quality, which can be harsh, and relatively high noise levels in the cabin. The 2006 W3500 Tiltmaster was primarily offered with a 5.7L Vortec V8 engine producing approximately 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4L80E 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission.
