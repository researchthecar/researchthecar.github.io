Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2004 Chevrolet LUV (also known as the Isuzu Faster in many markets). It's important to note that finding *specific* issues for this vehicle, especially with precise repair costs, can be challenging due to its age and the limited data available. The Chevrolet LUV was a rebadged Isuzu truck, so issues will likely be similar to those found on Isuzu Faster models of the same era.

The 2004 Chevrolet LUV, based on the Isuzu Faster, was primarily available with a 2.2L inline-four gasoline engine, producing around 118 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. A 2.5L turbodiesel engine (producing around 80 hp and 126 lb-ft of torque) was also an option in some markets. Transmission choices were typically a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the LUV for its affordability, simplicity, and fuel efficiency, making it a practical work truck. Common dislikes included its relatively small size, basic features, and sometimes underpowered engines, especially with the diesel variant.
