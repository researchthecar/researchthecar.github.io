### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet LUV, while a capable workhorse, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and design. Engine issues like head gasket failures and oil leaks, particularly with the 2.2L, and timing belt wear on the 2.6L, are notable. Transmission problems, especially harsh shifting in automatics and clutch wear in manuals, are also reported. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out, and electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. Rust is a significant concern for exterior longevity. Despite these points, many LUVs remain functional with proper maintenance and addressing these specific issues.
