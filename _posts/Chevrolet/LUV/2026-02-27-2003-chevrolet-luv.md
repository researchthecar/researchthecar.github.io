The automatic transmission can be prone to solenoid failures. Electrical systems may suffer from alternator issues and wiring corrosion over time. Exterior rust is a common concern for vehicles of this age, especially in certain climates. Interior components like the dashboard and HVAC blower motor can also require attention. Overall, the LUV can be a dependable truck if well-maintained, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific potential repair areas.
