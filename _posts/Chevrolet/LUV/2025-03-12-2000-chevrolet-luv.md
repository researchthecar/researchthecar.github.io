The 2000 Chevrolet LUV, also known as the Isuzu Faster or Rodeo in other markets, is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and affordability. For the 2000 model year, it typically came with a 2.2L Inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 118 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. Some models may have also featured a 2.6L Inline-4 engine, but it was less common. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the LUV's simple design, fuel efficiency, and ease of maintenance. Common dislikes include its relatively small size, limited power, and dated interior features compared to more modern trucks. The compact size makes it very popular in areas with tight roads and parking.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-4**

*   **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine idles roughly, sometimes stalling, particularly at lower RPMs. This can be more pronounced when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve can often resolve this issue. Clean or replace the throttle body. Check vacuum lines for leaks.

**Summary**

The 2000 Chevrolet LUV, while generally reliable, can suffer from issues typical of vehicles of its age. Engine problems like rough idling and misfires in the 2.2L engine can arise, often due to issues with the IAC valve, vacuum leaks, or ignition components. Transmission issues like harsh shifting or slipping in the 4-speed automatic can also occur. Suspension problems, like worn ball joints and tie rod ends, are common and can affect handling and tire wear. Electrical issues such as dim headlights and starter motor failures can be troublesome. Rust is a significant concern on the body panels, especially in areas with harsh weather conditions. The cost to address these issues varies widely, from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing sensors to more costly repairs like transmission rebuilds or body work. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect these areas before purchasing and factor in potential repair costs.
