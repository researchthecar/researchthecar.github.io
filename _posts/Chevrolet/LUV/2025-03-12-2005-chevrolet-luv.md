The 2005 Chevrolet LUV, also known as the Isuzu Faster in some markets, was a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and fuel efficiency, qualities that many owners appreciated. Available engines included a 2.2L inline-four producing approximately 130 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 3.2L V6. The engine options were generally paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its simple design and dependability, some owners reported issues related to age and normal wear and tear, particularly with models having higher mileage. The LUV was not sold in the U.S. market as a 2005 model year vehicle. Due to the name being used on another brand, no further information can be provided for the vehicle.
