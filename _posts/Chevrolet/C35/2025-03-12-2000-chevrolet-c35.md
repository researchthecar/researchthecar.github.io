The 2000 Chevrolet C35 is a heavy-duty, full-size pickup truck known for its robust towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 5.7L Vortec V8 (255 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque), the 7.4L Vortec V8 (290 hp and 410 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.5L Turbo Diesel V8 (215 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options consisted primarily of the 4L80E four-speed automatic. People generally appreciate the C35 for its durability, reliability (when properly maintained), and workhorse capabilities. However, common complaints include age-related issues, fuel economy, and some component failures.

**Engine**

**5.7L Vortec V8**
*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks externally at the front or rear of the intake manifold, or internally, leading to coolant in the oil (milky oil). Can cause overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets with updated, improved versions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

*   **Fuel Injector Failure (Spider Injector)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, poor fuel economy, and potentially a "spider" fuel injector failure (common with the original design).
    *   Solution: Replace the entire spider injector assembly with an updated multi-port fuel injection (MPFI) system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

**7.4L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Leaks (Rear Main Seal, Valve Covers)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil drips under the engine, typically near the rear of the engine or from the valve cover gaskets. Low oil pressure light may illuminate.

*   **Hard Shifts due to Faulty Solenoids**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts between gears.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty solenoids
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**

**Recalls:**

*   **99V328000:** The stop lamp switch may have been manufactured out of specification. This could cause the stop lamps to fail to illuminate when the brake pedal is depressed. Failure of the stop lamps could result in a crash without warning. Remedy: Dealers will replace the stop lamp switch.

*   **00V293000:** The affected vehicles were manufactured with a front suspension lower control arm ball joint that may separate. Ball joint separation may cause a sudden loss of vehicle control, increasing the risk of a crash. Remedy: Dealers will inspect and, if necessary, replace both front suspension lower control arms.

*   **00V046000:** The fuel feed and return lines to the engine could develop cracks at the connection points to the fuel tank. The cracks can cause a fuel leak, which, in the presence of an ignition source, could result in a fire. Remedy: Dealers will replace the fuel lines with nylon-covered lines.

In summary, the 2000 Chevrolet C35 is a capable truck, but common issues largely stem from its age. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely. Engine problems such as intake manifold gasket failure and PMD failure in the diesel engines can be moderately expensive. Transmission slippage can be a major expense, requiring a rebuild or replacement. Suspension wear and rust are also frequent concerns. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs.
