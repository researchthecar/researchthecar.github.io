The 2018 Chevrolet City Express is a compact cargo van designed for small businesses and urban environments. It is powered by a 2.0L Inline-4 engine producing 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and cargo capacity for its size. Common complaints revolve around its basic interior, lack of modern tech features, and occasionally rough CVT performance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. The exact cause can vary, ranging from worn valve stem seals to piston ring issues. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust (especially during startup), and the need to add oil frequently.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the oil consumption. If the issue is valve stem seals, replacing them is necessary. For piston ring issues, a more involved engine repair or replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+ depending on the cause and extent of repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced jerking or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the right ratio. The issue may be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid flush and replacement with the correct Nissan NS-3 CVT fluid could resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A number of owners have reported premature CVT failures at relatively low mileages (under 100,000 miles). Symptoms include loud whining noises, slipping, inability to accelerate, and eventually complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: CVT replacement is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the rear leaf springs sagging or even breaking, especially when the van is frequently used to carry heavy loads. This can result in a loss of ride height, reduced load-carrying capacity, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs. Consider aftermarket heavy-duty leaf springs if the van is often used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight or within a few days of non-use. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components, such as faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and eliminate the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve using a multimeter to check current draw with the ignition off and disconnecting circuits one by one to isolate the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Roller Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door rollers can wear down or become misaligned, making the sliding door difficult to open and close smoothly. This can result in binding, grinding noises, and excessive force required to operate the door.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or damaged sliding door rollers and lubricate the tracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag light on**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag light will be on at all times, usually a faulty sensor on one of the seatbelts or airbags.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the location of the sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Chevrolet City Express has some common issues. The most concerning are the potential for premature CVT failure and excessive oil consumption, both of which can lead to costly repairs. Other issues such as rear leaf spring problems, electrical drain, and sliding door roller issues are less severe but can still be inconvenient and require attention. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, potentially seeking a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's condition.
