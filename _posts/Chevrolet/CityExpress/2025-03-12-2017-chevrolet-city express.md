Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 Chevrolet City Express, organized as requested.

The 2017 Chevrolet City Express is a compact cargo van designed for urban businesses and light commercial use. It's essentially a rebadged Nissan NV200. It comes with one engine option: a 2.0L DOHC 16-valve 4-cylinder engine, producing 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option is a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the City Express for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency (for a cargo van), and relatively low cost of ownership. However, common complaints include its limited power, basic interior, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L DOHC 16-valve 4-cylinder engine**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated (often code P0420), reduced engine performance, potential rattling sound from the exhaust system. The converter fails due to excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Address any oil consumption issues to prevent premature failure of the new catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level, need to add oil frequently between oil changes, blueish smoke from the exhaust. Can eventually lead to engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Difficult to definitively fix. Potential solutions range from replacing valve stem seals and piston rings to engine replacement in severe cases. Regular oil level checks and top-offs are crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (valve stem seals) - $3000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure / Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky acceleration, slipping, hesitation, inability to accelerate, "whining" noise from the transmission, transmission overheating light. Can lead to complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid flush and software update may temporarily alleviate the issue. However, a full CVT replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Suspension Components (Struts, Ball Joints, Tie Rods)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, uneven tire wear, loose steering, poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn components. Usually, requires replacing the struts, ball joints, and tie rods in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner (depending on components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, slow cranking, frequent jump starts needed, battery not holding a charge.
    *   Solution: Battery replacement. Check the charging system (alternator) for proper operation as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Oxygen Sensors, Mass Airflow Sensor)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough idling, stalling.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues (Sticking, Difficulty Opening/Closing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door requires excessive force to open or close, gets stuck, or makes loud noises.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the tracks and rollers. If that doesn't fix it, the door latch, rollers, or cables may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (lubrication and minor adjustments) - $500+ (parts replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, especially in sun-exposed areas.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 (dashboard cover) - $1000+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet City Express, while practical and fuel-efficient, has some common issues to be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission, which can be prone to failure and expensive to replace. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and catalytic converter failure are also common and potentially costly. Other issues, such as suspension wear, electrical problems, and sliding door malfunctions, are less severe but should still be considered. Potential buyers should have any used City Express thoroughly inspected, paying close attention to the transmission and engine, and be prepared for potential repairs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major component failures. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand for CVT or engine replacements.
