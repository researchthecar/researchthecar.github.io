**2018 Chevrolet City Express**

The 2018 Chevrolet City Express is a compact cargo van manufactured by GM. It is nearly identical to the Nissan NV200, as it was built on the same platform. The City Express is powered by a 2.0L 16-valve I4 ECOTEC engine that produces 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. The engine is mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). The City Express offers a maximum cargo capacity of 122.7 cu-ft. It is a popular choice for businesses due to its affordability and functionality.
