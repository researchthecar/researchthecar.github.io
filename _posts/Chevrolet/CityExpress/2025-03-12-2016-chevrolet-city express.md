The 2016 Chevrolet City Express is a compact cargo van designed for urban use, known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability. It was only available with a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 131 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate its tight turning radius, cargo capacity, and relative affordability. However, common complaints include a basic interior, lack of advanced features, and relatively low power output.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Some cases report up to 1 quart every 1,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Regularly check the oil level and top off as needed. Consider using a higher viscosity oil. In severe cases, a piston ring replacement or engine rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine misfires, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the misfire often involves checking spark plugs, ignition coils, and fuel injectors. Replacing faulty components resolves the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission can experience premature failure, exhibiting symptoms such as slipping, shuddering, hesitation during acceleration, and unusual noises. A warning light on the dash may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT with a new or remanufactured unit is often the only viable solution. Regular fluid changes *might* prolong its life, but it is not guaranteed to prevent failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change might alleviate the symptoms in some cases. In other cases, software updates or more extensive repairs might be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of front suspension components such as ball joints, tie rod ends, and struts, leading to noises (clunking, rattling) and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components. It is recommended to replace parts in pairs (e.g., both struts).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the door lock actuators, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may fail to display an image, show a distorted image, or work intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check the camera's wiring and connections. Replacing the camera itself or the head unit (if integrated) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding doors (especially the side doors) can be difficult to open or close, or may rattle when driving.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the door alignment, lubricating the tracks, or replacing worn rollers or latches.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is the only permanent solution. Dashboard covers are a temporary fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet City Express has several reported issues, the most significant being potential CVT failure, which can be very costly to repair. Other common problems include excessive oil consumption, electrical glitches, and suspension wear. While some issues are relatively minor, the potential for expensive CVT repairs should be a major consideration for potential buyers. The reported issues are of moderate severity overall, with some potentially leading to significant repair costs.
