The 2017 Chevrolet LCF 4500XD is a low cab forward (LCF) truck designed for commercial use. It provides good maneuverability and visibility, appreciated by drivers who often navigate tight city streets. Engine options included the 5.7L V8 gasoline engine and the 5.2L inline-4 Isuzu diesel engine. The 5.2L diesel engine generates 215 horsepower and 452 lb-ft of torque. Aisin transmissions were primarily used in these trucks. Drivers often like the easy access to the engine compartment and the relatively simple design for maintenance. Common dislikes include the cab's basic interior and the somewhat firm ride. The most common engine is the 5.2L diesel engine.

**Engine**

**5.2L Isuzu 4HK1-TC Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, incomplete regenerations, DPF clogging, reduced engine power, and the "check engine" light illuminating. This is often exacerbated by short trips and frequent idling.
    *   Solution: Performing forced DPF regeneration, cleaning the DPF, or replacing the DPF. Addressing underlying issues causing excessive soot production (e.g., faulty injectors, EGR valve). Upgrading the DPF system components to a newer version can sometimes alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the required repair and the shop doing the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Injectors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors may fail due to contamination or wear, causing poor engine performance, misfires, rough idling, excessive smoke, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injectors. Thoroughly cleaning the fuel system to prevent future contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,500+ depending on the number of injectors replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR valve may become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, poor acceleration, increased emissions, and "check engine" light activation.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L V8 Gasoline**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**Aisin A460 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shifting Problems/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifting between gears, slipping during gear changes, failure to engage a gear, or unusual noises during shifting.
    *   Solution: Fluid Check/Change. Replacing valve body solenoids or the valve body itself. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4,000+ depending on the severity of the problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, reduced fuel economy, and difficulty maintaining speed on inclines.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. Inspecting the transmission for any damage caused by the failing torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable sagging of the rear suspension, reduced load-carrying capacity, rough ride, and potential for leaf spring breakage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn or broken leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shocks and/or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion or damage to wiring harnesses, particularly those exposed to the elements or in high-stress areas (e.g., engine bay, chassis). This can cause various electrical problems, including sensor failures, lighting issues, and starting problems.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing damaged sections of the wiring harness. Protecting the wiring harness from further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues affecting various systems, such as lights, power windows, door locks, and security system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, particularly in areas prone to salt exposure or damage, such as the frame, undercarriage, and body panels.
    *   Solution: Thorough rust removal, rust converter application, and repainting or coating the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blower motor stops working, resulting in no air circulation from the vents.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor and/or blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet LCF 4500XD, when equipped with the 5.2L Isuzu diesel engine, can suffer from issues related to the emissions system, particularly the DPF and EGR. Transmission problems, primarily with the Aisin automatic, also surface. Suspension issues revolve around leaf springs, given the truck's load-carrying focus. Electrical problems tend to stem from wiring or BCM issues. Exterior corrosion and HVAC blower problems are also noted. The severity ranges from relatively minor fixes to more significant repairs, with costs potentially exceeding several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Buyers should have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase, paying close attention to the emissions system, transmission behavior, and overall condition of the chassis and electrical systems.
