### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet Zafira presents a mixed reliability profile. While its exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of common issues affecting the engine and transmission options. Diesel engines, particularly the 2.0 DTI, can experience turbocharger and injector pump problems. Petrol engines, like the 1.8L and 2.2L Ecotec, are prone to oil and coolant leaks. Automatic transmissions may develop harsh shifting or torque converter issues. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster failures and window regulator problems, are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential costs and ensuring the longevity of the vehicle.
