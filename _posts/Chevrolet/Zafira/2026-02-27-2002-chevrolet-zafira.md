### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet Zafira presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core mechanicals can be robust with proper care, common issues tend to surface with age and mileage. Engine concerns like EGR valve problems and oil leaks on petrol variants, and turbocharger issues on diesel models, are notable. Transmission reliability is generally fair, but clutch wear and automatic transmission fluid leaks can occur. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module, can be frustrating and costly to diagnose. Rust can also be a concern on older examples. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Zafiras remain functional family vehicles, especially if well-maintained. Prospective buyers should prioritize a thorough inspection, focusing on the aforementioned problem areas.
