### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Zafira is a practical family vehicle with a generally acceptable reliability record for its age. Common issues tend to be concentrated in areas like the engine (particularly with diesel variants experiencing injector pump or turbo problems, and petrol engines with ignition coils), and some electrical components such as the Body Control Module. Suspension wear and tear, especially bushings, are also frequently reported. While exterior rust can be a concern on older models, and interior climate control components like the blower resistor may fail, these are not typically catastrophic failures. With diligent maintenance and prompt attention to reported issues, the Zafira can remain a dependable choice.
