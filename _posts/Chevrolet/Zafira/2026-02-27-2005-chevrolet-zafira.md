### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Zafira, while a practical family vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns, particularly with its diesel engines (DPF and EGR issues) and certain manual transmissions (M32 bearing wear). Petrol engines can suffer from oil leaks or turbocharger problems depending on the specific unit. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or instrument cluster, are also noted. Exterior rust can be an issue on older models. Interior comfort systems like the HVAC blower motor resistor are also prone to failure. Despite these potential issues, many Zafiras remain on the road with diligent maintenance and timely repairs.
