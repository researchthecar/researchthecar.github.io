### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet Zafira, while a practical choice, exhibits some common issues typical for vehicles of its age and European origins. Diesel variants, particularly those with the 1.9 CDTI engine, are prone to DPF and EGR system problems, which can be costly to repair if not addressed promptly. Manual transmissions, especially the M32 variant, are known for bearing wear. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and instrument cluster can also occur. Owners should be mindful of potential rust, especially in certain climates. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues as they arise, the Zafira can remain a reliable family vehicle.
