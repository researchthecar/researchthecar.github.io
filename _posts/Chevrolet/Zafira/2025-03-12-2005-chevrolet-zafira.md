Available engine options for this model year included various gasoline and diesel engines, but for this response, we will focus on the most common gasoline engine, the 1.8L Z18XE inline-4. This engine produced approximately 125 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Zafira for its practicality, flexible seating configuration, and relatively compact size, making it easy to maneuver in urban environments.
