The 2009 Chevrolet Aveo5 is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It came with one engine option: a 1.6L DOHC 4-cylinder engine producing approximately 106 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. This engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Aveo5 for its low price point and decent gas mileage, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. However, it was often criticized for its lackluster performance, build quality, and reliability issues.

**Engine**

**1.6L DOHC 4-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Check Engine Light Due to Faulty Oxygen Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to the oxygen sensor are present, such as P0131, P0132, P0133, P0135, P0141, etc. The vehicle may experience poor fuel economy or rough idling.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor. It is recommended to replace all oxygen sensors to avoid future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for cable adjustment or replacement. $400 - $1200+ for clutch replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Out Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll during turns, longer stopping distances, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced handling.

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet Aveo5 is known for its budget-friendly price but suffers from several reliability concerns. Engine issues like oxygen sensor failure and coolant leaks are common, while transmission problems can range from rough shifting to complete failure. Suspension components wear out quickly, leading to ride quality issues. Electrical gremlins, like faulty ignition switches and power window malfunctions, are also frequently reported. Rust is a major issue, particularly in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, more severe issues like transmission rebuilds or extensive rust repair can be costly. The overall severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially debilitating mechanical failures.
