The 2002 Chevrolet G30, part of the G-series vans, was a workhorse known for its reliability and spaciousness, making it popular for conversions into RVs, ambulances, and work vans. The 2002 model year came with several engine options including a 4.3L V6, a 5.0L V8, a 5.7L V8, and a 7.4L V8. The 5.7L V8 produced approximately 255 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciated the G30's robust build and simple mechanics, making it relatively easy to maintain and repair. However, some common complaints included issues with rust, particularly in areas prone to salt exposure, and the van's somewhat dated interior and fuel economy compared to more modern vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet G30 is generally a reliable van, but like any vehicle of that age, it is prone to certain issues. Engine problems such as intake manifold gasket leaks and fuel injector failures in the 5.7L and distributor issues in the 7.4L V8 are common, and can range from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars to repair. Transmission issues with the 4L80E can be very costly, potentially requiring a complete rebuild or replacement. Rust is also a significant concern, especially in areas with harsh winter conditions. Overall, while the G30 is a capable vehicle, potential buyers should be prepared for the possibility of repairs, especially given its age. Addressing these common problems can help keep the van running smoothly for many years.
