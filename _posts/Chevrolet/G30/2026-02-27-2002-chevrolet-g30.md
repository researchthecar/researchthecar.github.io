### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet G30 is a capable commercial vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with its V8 engines, specifically intake manifold gasket leaks and oil cooler line failures. The automatic transmissions, while generally robust, can experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as wiring harness issues and alternator failures, are also noted. Exterior rust, especially on lower body panels, is a concern for vehicles in certain climates. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and dashboard gauge functionality can be points of failure. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these areas are crucial for maintaining the reliability of the G30.
