The 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV is an all-electric subcompact SUV offering a practical and relatively affordable entry point into the EV market. It comes equipped with a single electric motor powering the front wheels, producing 200 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. There are no other powertrain options available.
