### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EUV generally exhibits good reliability, particularly in its electric powertrain which has fewer moving parts than a combustion engine. The primary areas of concern revolve around the electric vehicle's core components: the battery pack and charging system. Battery degradation is a long-term consideration for all EVs, and while typically covered under warranty for a significant period, replacement costs can be substantial outside of warranty. Charging system faults, though not overwhelmingly common, can be inconvenient and costly to repair. Infotainment software glitches are also a possibility, usually resolvable with updates. Other categories like suspension, exterior, and interior show no widespread reported issues, indicating solid build quality in these areas.
