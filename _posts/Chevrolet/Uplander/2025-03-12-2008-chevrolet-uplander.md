The 2008 Chevrolet Uplander is a minivan that aimed to provide a practical and affordable family vehicle. It came with a 3.9L LZ9 V6 engine that produced 240 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. People liked the Uplander for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and versatility. However, some common complaints included mediocre fuel economy, bland styling, and some reliability concerns. The Uplander was only offered with the 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.9L LZ9 V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue is a leaking intake manifold gasket. This can cause coolant leaks, rough idling, misfires, and decreased engine performance. You may also notice a sweet coolant smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gasket is the typical repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Train Noise (Valve Ticking)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive valve ticking or clattering, especially at startup or when the engine is cold. This can be caused by worn lifters, or low oil pressure.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity and cause, the fix could involve replacing the lifters, valve springs, or the entire valve train.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common on higher mileage vehicles. Potential leak locations include the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4T65E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4T65E is known for experiencing harsh or delayed shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or when shifting into reverse. This can be caused by wear in the valve body, solenoid issues, or internal clutch pack damage.
    *   Solution: A valve body rebuild or replacement, solenoid replacement, or a full transmission rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2500+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause shuddering, stalling, and poor acceleration. Debris from a failing torque converter can also contaminate the transmission fluid and cause further damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter and flushing the transmission. In some cases, a full transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging or Broken**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uplander uses a rear leaf spring suspension which is prone to sagging over time. The springs themselves can even crack or break from corrosion or stress. This can cause the rear end to sit lower than normal, and a generally rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors can experience problems, including failure to open or close, intermittent operation, or making unusual noises. This can be due to faulty motors, wiring problems, or damaged sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific issue and replacing the faulty motor, wiring harness, or sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The BCM controls various electrical functions, and issues with it can manifest as intermittent problems with the lights, power windows, door locks, and other systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and potentially reprogramming or replacing the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting Rocker Panels and Quarter Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lower body panels, especially the rocker panels and rear quarter panels, are prone to rust, particularly in areas with harsh winters and road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which could involve patching, welding in new panels, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on the severity of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor resistor controls the speed of the HVAC fan. Failure can result in the fan only working on certain speeds (usually high) or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Chevrolet Uplander has several common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and valve train noise can lead to moderate repair costs. The 4T65E transmission is known for shifting problems, which may require expensive repairs. Suspension issues, electrical glitches with power doors and the BCM, and rust are also potential concerns. Overall, while the Uplander offers practicality, it's important to factor in the potential for these repairs when considering purchasing one.
