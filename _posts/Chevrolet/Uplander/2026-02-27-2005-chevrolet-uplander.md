### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Uplander is a practical minivan with several common issues that owners should be aware of. The most frequently reported problems lie within the transmission, particularly the 4T65-E, with torque converter and solenoid failures being notable concerns. Engine issues, such as intake manifold gasket leaks and EGR valve clogging, are also present for both the 3.5L and 3.9L V6 options. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or ignition switch, can lead to frustrating intermittent problems. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts may require attention over time. Exterior and interior issues, while less critical, include malfunctioning sliding door mechanisms and premature wear on upholstery. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Uplanders provide reliable service if these common issues are addressed proactively.
