The 2022 Chevrolet Groove is a subcompact SUV primarily sold in emerging markets, not in North America or Europe. It's generally praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and modern styling for its segment. However, some common criticisms include a lack of advanced safety features and a relatively underpowered engine, which is a naturally-aspirated 1.5-liter inline-4 producing around 110 horsepower and 108 lb-ft of torque. This engine is typically paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Other regions might have different configurations, but the 1.5L with CVT is the most prevalent.

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4**

*   **Loss of Power/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing a noticeable lack of power, especially when accelerating from a stop or climbing hills. Hesitation can also be present, where the engine momentarily fails to respond to throttle input.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for vacuum leaks, cleaning or replacing the mass airflow sensor (MAF), and verifying proper fuel delivery. A software update for the engine control unit (ECU) may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Engine Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unusual rattling or knocking sounds coming from the engine, particularly at idle or during acceleration. This could indicate issues with connecting rod bearings, piston slap, or valve train components.
    *   Solution: A mechanic should inspect the engine for the source of the noise. Depending on the diagnosis, repairs may involve replacing the bearings, pistons, or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Slipping/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission exhibits slipping, especially under hard acceleration. This feels like the engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. Hesitation can also occur when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Initially, a CVT fluid change with the correct, specified fluid is recommended. If the problem persists, the CVT might require internal repair or replacement. A software update for the transmission control module (TCM) may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or buzzing sound coming from the transmission, often becoming louder with vehicle speed. This may indicate wear or damage to the CVT's internal components, such as the belt or pulleys.
    *   Solution: The source of the noise needs to be diagnosed by a mechanic. Depending on the severity, the CVT may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing premature wear of suspension components like shock absorbers, struts, and bushings. This can lead to a bumpy ride, poor handling, and unusual noises when driving over uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Regularly inspect the suspension components for signs of wear or damage. Replace worn-out parts as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes or crashes, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Try performing a soft reset of the infotainment system. Check for software updates and install them if available. If the problem persists, the system may need to be diagnosed and repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with sensors, such as the ABS sensor or the oxygen sensor, leading to warning lights on the dashboard and potential performance problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor using a scan tool and replace it with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Door Seals**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin during heavy rain or car washes due to inadequate sealing around the doors.
    *   Solution: Replace the door seals with higher-quality replacements or adjust existing seals to improve their fit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard or interior trim panels, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the noise and secure the loose panels or components with foam padding or clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ (depending on the complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Power Windows/Locks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows or door locks that fail to operate correctly, either intermittently or completely.
    *   Solution: Check the wiring and connectors for any damage or loose connections. Replace the window motor or door lock actuator if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window/lock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Chevrolet Groove, while an affordable option, faces common issues related to engine power, transmission performance (specifically the CVT), and some electrical and interior quality concerns. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances like rattles to more significant problems such as CVT failure. The cost of repairs can also vary widely, from a few dollars for minor adjustments to several thousand dollars for major repairs. While there are not many recalls, be prepared to invest in preventative maintenance to avoid major issues.
