The 2009 Chevrolet Epica, also known as the Daewoo Tosca in some markets, was a mid-size sedan offering a blend of affordability and features. It was powered by a 2.5L inline-six engine that produced around 156 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with an Aisin 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Epica for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively low price point. Common dislikes included its unimpressive fuel economy and somewhat bland styling.
