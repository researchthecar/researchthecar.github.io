### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet Epica presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly with the automatic transmission experiencing shifting problems and potential leaks in the engine. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, can also be a source of frustration. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior climate control components are other areas to monitor. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to seals, gaskets, transmission components, and electrical modules. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating costs and ensuring longevity.
