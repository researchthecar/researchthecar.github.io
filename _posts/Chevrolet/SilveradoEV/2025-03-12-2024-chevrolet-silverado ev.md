The 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV is GM's full-size, all-electric pickup truck, marking a significant entry into the EV truck market. This initial model year is primarily focused on the Work Truck (WT) trim and the RST trim, with more trim levels planned for the future. The Silverado EV boasts impressive performance figures, with the RST trim offering up to 754 horsepower and 785 lb-ft of torque in Wide Open Watts mode. Battery range is estimated to be up to 450 miles on a full charge, depending on the configuration. Consumers appreciate the Silverado EV for its powerful acceleration, spacious cabin, and advanced technology features. However, early adopters have noted some concerns regarding software glitches, availability, and the higher price point compared to traditional gasoline-powered trucks.
