Other issues such as oil consumption in the 6.0L Vortec, suspension wear, and electrical problems are also common and should be inspected. Rust can also be a significant concern depending on the truck's location and maintenance history. Overall, while the Silverado 2500 HD is a robust truck, careful inspection and awareness of these potential issues are crucial before purchasing.
