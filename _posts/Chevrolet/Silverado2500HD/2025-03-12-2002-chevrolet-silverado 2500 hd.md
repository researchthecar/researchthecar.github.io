**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, while a capable and durable truck, is prone to several common issues. Engine and transmission problems vary depending on the specific configuration, with the Duramax LB7 engine being particularly susceptible to fuel injector failures. Rust, electrical glitches, and suspension wear are also prevalent concerns. The severity and cost of these issues can range from minor repairs to major overhauls, making it important for prospective buyers to thoroughly inspect the truck and be aware of these potential problems. The costs can be relatively low for small repairs like oil pressure sensors, but much higher for engine or transmission overhauls or rust repair, making this a vehicle that can potentially cost a lot more to maintain in the long run.
