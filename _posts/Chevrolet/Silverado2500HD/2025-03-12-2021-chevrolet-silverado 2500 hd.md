The 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include a 6.6L V8 gas engine producing 401 horsepower and 464 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 engine producing 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque. The gas engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel engine is paired with a 10-speed Allison automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Silverado 2500 HD for its robust engine options, comfortable ride (considering its heavy-duty nature), and advanced towing technology. Some common dislikes include the interior design (which is considered dated by some) and the sometimes-stiff ride when the truck is unloaded.

**Engine**

**6.6L Gas V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) / Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idle, misfires. The AFM/DFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can lead to oil consumption issues and related engine problems.
    *   Solution: A range of solutions may be required depending on the severity of the issue. Can include replacing valve lifters, disabling the AFM/DFM system via aftermarket tuning, or in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ depending on the severity and chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, rattling noises from under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ per converter, depending on location and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, white smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per injector, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, fuel system contamination with metal shavings. The CP4 pump is known to be less tolerant of fuel contamination than previous designs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CP4 pump, fuel lines, fuel injectors, and potentially the fuel tank if contamination is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ due to the extensive nature of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.6L Gas V8)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds, slippage between gears, or complete failure to engage.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. In some cases, a transmission rebuild might be recommended if internal damage is present.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Allison Automatic (Paired with 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8)**

*   **Harsh/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifts, especially between lower gears, delayed shifting, or inconsistent shift patterns.
    *   Solution:  Software reflash, valve body replacement, or potentially a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (reflash) - $5,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Fluid Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible fluid leaks under the vehicle, particularly around the transmission pan or seals.  Low transmission fluid levels can lead to poor shifting performance and eventual transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaking seals or gaskets.  In some cases, the transmission pan itself might be warped or damaged and need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded. Reduced load-carrying capacity, poor ride quality, and potential handling issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.  Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for towing or hauling heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per spring, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and random system reboots.
    *   Solution: Software update, replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (update) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., ABS, TPMS, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard, inaccurate readings, or complete failure of the affected system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Bed Flexing/Separation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible gap between the bed and the cab, particularly on trucks that are frequently used for heavy towing or hauling.
    *   Solution: Reinforcing the bed mounting points or replacing damaged bed components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and chosen repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Tailgate Issues**

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD exhibits a range of potential issues, from relatively minor infotainment glitches and sensor malfunctions to more significant engine and transmission problems. The most concerning issues involve potential fuel pump and injector failure in the diesel engine, as well as AFM/DFM issues in the gas engine, and torque converter issues in the 6-speed transmission. While the severity and cost of these problems vary, buyers should be aware of the potential for expensive repairs, particularly with the diesel engine. Addressing issues promptly can mitigate potential long-term damage.
