The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing capacity and ruggedness. It offers a comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck and has a user-friendly infotainment system. Some owners dislike the truck's somewhat dated interior design and occasionally report issues with reliability. Engine options include a 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 (445 hp, 910 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with an Allison 1000 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Turbodiesel V8 (L5P)**

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature fuel injector failure, leading to rough idling, decreased fuel economy, excessive smoke, and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injectors. In some cases, the high-pressure fuel pump may also need to be inspected and replaced if contaminated by debris from failing injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the engine, especially in cold weather. Check engine light may illuminate.

    * Recalls: None Found

* **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, no start condition, metallic debris in the fuel system. The CP4 fuel pump is known to be less tolerant of low-quality fuel and can fail catastrophically.
    * Solution: Replacement of the CP4 fuel pump and potentially the entire fuel system, including injectors, fuel lines, and fuel tank if contaminated with debris.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000+

    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light. AFM system lifters can fail, causing significant engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, and in severe cases, the camshaft. Many owners choose to delete the AFM system entirely to prevent future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic**

    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush and replacement with updated fluid, or replacement of the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hard or Delayed Shifts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays or harshness during shifting, particularly between certain gears.
    * Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, worn valve body, or internal damage. Diagnosis and repair may involve fluid replacement, valve body rebuild or replacement, or transmission overhaul.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sitting lower than the front, reduced payload capacity.

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most concerning issues revolve around the 6.6L Duramax diesel engine, particularly fuel injector and CP4 fuel pump failures, which can be very expensive to repair. The 6.0L gasoline engine also has its share of problems, including oil consumption and AFM lifter failure. Other issues, such as transmission shudder, suspension component wear, and electrical glitches, can also add to the overall cost of ownership. While some of these issues are relatively minor, others can be quite severe and costly to address. Buyers should carefully inspect any used 2017 Silverado 2500 HD and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic to identify potential problems before making a purchase.
