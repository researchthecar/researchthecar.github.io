Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, categorized by major component and engine/transmission options.

The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.6L L8T V8 gasoline engine, producing 401 horsepower and 464 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.6L L5P Duramax turbodiesel V8, generating 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are highly regarded for their power and reliability. The gasoline engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the Duramax diesel engine is paired with an Allison 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the truck's robust build, towing capacity, and comfortable interior, especially in higher trim levels. However, some common complaints include the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, the relatively basic interior in lower trims, and occasional electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**6.6L L8T V8 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, excessive oil consumption, check engine light illumination. This is due to the AFM/DFM system deactivating cylinders to improve fuel economy, which can lead to lifter collapse and subsequent engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners opt for AFM/DFM delete kits to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L L5P Duramax Turbodiesel V8**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls, difficulty starting, rough idling, metallic debris in the fuel system. The CP4 pump is known to be susceptible to failure due to its design, especially when exposed to low-quality fuel. When the fuel pump fails, it sends metal fragments throughout the entire fuel system.
    *   Solution: Complete fuel system replacement, including the high-pressure fuel pump, fuel injectors, fuel rails, and fuel lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $9,000-$12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, engine overheating. Cracks in the EGR cooler can lead to coolant leaks into the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: EGR cooler replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 10-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.6L Duramax Diesel)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable clunking or jerking during gear changes, hesitation when accelerating. Can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Software re-flash/reprogramming of the Transmission Control Module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration or shuddering felt at highway speeds, especially during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush with updated fluid. In more severe cases, torque converter replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.6L Gas Engine)**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Vibration/Wobble (Death Wobble)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Steering wheel shakes violently, particularly at highway speeds or after hitting a bump. This can be caused by loose steering components, worn ball joints, or an unbalanced front end.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn steering and suspension components, including tie rod ends, ball joints, steering stabilizer, and balancing of tires. Alignment is typically required afterward.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, black screen, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, loss of audio.
    *   Solution: Software update, infotainment system reset, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty readings from sensors (e.g., tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), blind spot monitoring), leading to warning lights and inaccurate information displayed on the instrument panel.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty sensor and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days of sitting, requiring a jump start. Caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the parasitic draw. This may involve tracing the circuit and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Bumper Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature rusting, especially around the seams and welds on the rear bumper.

**Summary**

The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, while a capable and powerful truck, does have some potential problem areas. Engine issues, particularly with the diesel's CP4 fuel pump and the gas engine's AFM/DFM lifters, can be very expensive to repair. Electrical glitches and suspension problems can also be bothersome. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant repair costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider purchasing an extended warranty or having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic. The severity of these issues varies, but the potential cost of repairs for engine and fuel system failures is high.
