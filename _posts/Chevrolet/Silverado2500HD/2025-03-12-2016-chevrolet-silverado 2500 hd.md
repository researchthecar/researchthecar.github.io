The 2016 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (397 hp, 765 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the truck's robust build, powerful engine options, and comfortable interior (depending on the trim level). Common dislikes include reports of electronic glitches, ride quality (typical of heavy-duty trucks), and some reliability concerns.
