**6.6L L8T V8 Gasoline Engine**
*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illuminated. Often accompanied by codes related to cylinder deactivation. Can be caused by defective AFM lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, potentially requiring cylinder head removal. Some owners opt to replace all lifters and disable AFM entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+

**6.6L L5P Duramax Turbodiesel V8**

*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls, difficulty starting, check engine light. The CP4 pump, known for its design flaw, can self-destruct and send metal debris throughout the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CP4 pump and potentially the entire fuel system, including injectors, fuel rails, and fuel lines, to remove contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $9,000 - $12,000+

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable harsh shifts between gears, especially at low speeds. Some owners report a clunking noise during shifting or when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM). If the problem persists, valve body inspection and possible replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (recalibration) - $1,500+ (valve body)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibration or shudder felt during light acceleration, usually at highway speeds. This can be caused by torque converter clutch slippage.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush with updated fluid, or torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $2,000+ (torque converter)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Steering Wander/Drift**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle tends to wander or drift from its intended path, requiring constant steering corrections.
    *   Solution: Inspection of steering components, including tie rod ends, ball joints, and steering gear. Wheel alignment and potentially replacement of worn components.
