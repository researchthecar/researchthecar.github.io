### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a generally robust truck, particularly its heavy-duty V8 and Duramax diesel engines, and the robust Allison transmission. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks on gasoline engines, and injector or EGR cooler problems on the Duramax. Transmission issues, while not universal, can arise, especially with the 4L80-E. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear given the truck's intended use. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM, and common interior wear like seat upholstery and HVAC blend doors are also points to consider. Rust can be a significant concern depending on the climate. Overall, with diligent maintenance and attention to these known areas, the 2004 Silverado 2500 HD can remain a reliable workhorse.
