The 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. It offered a comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck, a reasonably quiet cabin, and strong engine options. Some common complaints included a stiff ride when unloaded, a somewhat dated interior design compared to competitors, and occasional issues with the infotainment system. Engine options included a 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (397 hp, 765 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, and potentially a check engine light. This is related to the lifters that deactivate cylinders when the AFM system is engaged, allowing the engine to run on fewer cylinders at low loads.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters, potentially with updated lifters that are less prone to failure. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust might be observed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of oil consumption which can be bad valve seals, worn piston rings, or PCV valve issues. Fix any issue found.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (LML)**

*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, lack of power, difficulty starting, and potentially metallic debris found in the fuel system. The CP4 pump, unlike earlier Duramax fuel pumps, is more susceptible to failure when contaminated with poor quality fuel.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 pump. Consider upgrading to a CP3 pump (from earlier Duramax models) for increased reliability (though this requires additional modifications). Thoroughly flush the entire fuel system to remove any debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ due to the potential for contamination of the entire fuel system
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: White smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and potentially engine overheating. The EGR cooler can crack or leak, allowing coolant to enter the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during lockup, erratic shifting, and potential for complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, inability to shift into certain gears, or transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potential for bottoming out.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs, potentially with heavy-duty aftermarket options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Steering Knuckle Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front of the truck, sloppy steering feel, and excessive play in the steering wheel.
    * Solution: Replace the steering knuckle and potentially any other affected steering or suspension components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and screen flickering.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available), or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ depending on the solution
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, or lighting.
    *   Solution: Replace the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Cab Corners**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the lower portions of the body, particularly the rocker panels and cab corners.
    *   Solution: Repair and repaint the affected areas, or replace the panels if the rust is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or install a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The most severe and costly issues relate to the Duramax diesel engine (CP4 pump) and transmission problems. While the gas engine is generally reliable, the AFM system can cause problems. Suspension wear and electrical glitches are also common concerns. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls. Careful inspection and preventative maintenance are essential for keeping this truck in good working order.
