Available engines include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8 (340 hp, 455 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (300 hp, 520 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options include the 4L80E 4-speed automatic and the Allison 1000 5-speed automatic (primarily paired with the Duramax). Owners generally appreciate the Silverado 2500 HD for its towing capacity and workhorse capabilities. Common complaints often revolve around the age-related wear and tear of components, particularly within the suspension and electrical systems, as well as specific issues related to the Duramax diesel engine.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

**Summary**

The 2004 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, while a capable truck, is prone to several age-related issues. The Duramax diesel engine, specifically the LB7 variant, is susceptible to fuel injector failures, a significant expense. Suspension components like the pitman and idler arms, and ball joints, are also common wear items. Electrical problems, often stemming from the instrument cluster or BCM, can also arise. Rust is also a major issue in areas that salt the roads in the winter. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but owners should be prepared for potential maintenance and repair expenses, particularly if purchasing a higher-mileage example.
