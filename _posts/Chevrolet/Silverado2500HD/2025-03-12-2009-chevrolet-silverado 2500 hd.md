The 2009 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (gasoline) producing 360 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 generating 365 hp and 660 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consist of a 6-speed automatic transmission (Allison 1000 for the Duramax, and a Hydra-Matic for the 6.0L gas). Owners generally appreciate its workhorse nature and dependability, while common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially the gas engine) and some reported reliability issues with certain components.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (Gas)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced fuel economy. Often occurs at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder heads. Some owners choose to disable AFM altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil usage, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be present.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, solutions range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, or a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (LMM)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, white smoke from the exhaust, reduced power, and fuel dilution in the oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). May require replacing all injectors to ensure even operation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector (depending on labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, engine overheating, and a sweet smell (coolant) from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Vane Position Sensor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, sluggish acceleration, and potential for "limp mode." Error codes related to turbocharger performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the vane position sensor or the entire turbocharger assembly, depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 (6-Speed - Diesel)**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, while generally a reliable work truck, does have some common issues. Engine problems, particularly lifter failure in the 6.0L gas engine and injector issues in the Duramax diesel, can be expensive to address. Transmission issues, especially with the torque converter and valve body, are also reported. Electrical problems, such as instrument cluster and BCM failures, can be frustrating. Rust is a common concern, particularly in areas with harsh climates. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely, but some of the more significant issues can lead to substantial repair bills. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the truck for these issues and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
