**Summary**

The 2003 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a capable truck but has some common issues owners should be aware of. The Duramax diesel's fuel injector problems are particularly concerning due to the high cost of repair. Rust is also a significant issue in certain climates. Electrical problems with the instrument cluster and fuel pump can also be frustrating. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine work, can be costly. Buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle for these potential issues before purchase.
