The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include a 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 engine (397 hp, 765 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (Allison 1000 for Duramax). Owners often praise the truck's robust build, powerful engine options, and comfortable ride for a heavy-duty vehicle. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, some electrical gremlins, and potential issues with the diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) system on the Duramax models.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 Gasoline**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, loss of power, and potentially a ticking noise from the engine. Can lead to camshaft damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Deleting the AFM system is a common preventative measure by replacing with non-AFM lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent topping off. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Could be piston rings, valve seals, or PCV valve issue. Requires diagnosis to determine the root cause. Replacement of piston rings is a major repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbodiesel V8 (LML)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, white smoke from exhaust, fuel in the oil. Can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1,200+ per injector, includes labor and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Service Exhaust Fluid System" message, reduced engine power, potential limp mode. Issues can stem from DEF quality, DEF tank heater failure, DEF injector issues, or NOX sensor failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue (DEF quality test, scan for diagnostic trouble codes). Replacement of DEF tank heater, DEF injector, or NOX sensors might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the failed component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls, won't start, metallic debris in the fuel system. The CP4 pump is known to self-destruct, sending metal shavings throughout the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Complete fuel system replacement including the CP4 pump, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and fuel tank cleaning. CP3 conversion kits are popular to replace the CP4.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000-$12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed (paired with 6.6L Duramax)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at highway speeds. Can also manifest as slipping or erratic shifting.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, transmission slipping, getting stuck in gear.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Hydra-Matic 6L90 6-Speed (paired with 6.0L Vortec)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at highway speeds. Can also manifest as slipping or erratic shifting.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, transmission slipping, getting stuck in gear.

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD, while a capable truck, can suffer from various issues. The Duramax diesel is prone to fuel injector and DEF system problems which can be costly. The 6.0L gasoline engine can develop issues with the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system which leads to lifter failure. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM, are also a concern. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work, especially on the Duramax, can be quite costly. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are recommended, especially when considering a Duramax-equipped model. Check for maintenance records and consider having a mechanic inspect the truck before buying.
