The 2005 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and dependability. It was offered with several engine and transmission options: the 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8 gasoline engine (330 hp, 450 lb-ft of torque), and the venerable 6.6L Duramax LBZ turbodiesel V8 (360 hp, 650 lb-ft of torque). Transmissions included the 4L80E four-speed automatic (primarily with the 6.0L) and the Allison 1000 five-speed automatic (standard with the Duramax, optional with the 6.0L and 8.1L). People appreciate the truck's strong towing capacity, comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck), and relatively simple design. Common dislikes often revolve around fuel economy, age-related wear and tear, and certain known issues related to the diesel engine's emissions systems and injector durability.

**Engine**
