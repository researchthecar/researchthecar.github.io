The 2006 Chevrolet Suburban 1500, while offering space and utility, has its share of potential issues. Engine problems such as AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, particularly with the 5.3L V8, can be costly. Transmission issues, specifically with the 4L60E, may lead to slipping or harsh shifting, requiring significant repairs. Suspension issues, electrical glitches, and rust are also common areas of concern. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can lead to repair bills totaling several thousand dollars.
