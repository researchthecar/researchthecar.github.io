### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Suburban 1500 is a capable and generally durable full-size SUV. The most common significant issues tend to revolve around the 5.3L V8 engine's Active Fuel Management (AFM) system and potential torque converter problems in the 4L60-E transmission. Suspension components like ball joints can also wear out. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age. While rust can be a concern on older models, the core mechanicals are often robust if properly maintained. Addressing AFM and transmission concerns proactively can significantly enhance long-term reliability.
