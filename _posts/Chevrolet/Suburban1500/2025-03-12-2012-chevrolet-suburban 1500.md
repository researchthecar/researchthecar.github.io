**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Suburban 1500, while a capable and spacious SUV, is prone to several common issues. Engine-related problems, particularly AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as torque converter failure and harsh shifting, are also prevalent. Suspension problems, especially with the Autoride system, and electrical glitches affecting the instrument cluster and other components are also common. Interior issues like cracked dashboards and blend door actuator failure also detract from the vehicle's overall value. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making a thorough inspection and service history review essential before purchasing. The severity of these issues range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
