### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Suburban 1500 is a capable and generally reliable large SUV, particularly with the robust Vortec V8 engines. The most common concerns revolve around potential issues with the 4L60-E transmission, especially torque converter problems and overheating, and some engine-specific issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and AFM lifter wear on the 5.3L. Suspension components like ball joints and shocks can wear out with mileage. Electrical gremlins, such as window motors and instrument clusters, are also noted. Rust can be a concern in certain climates. Despite these potential issues, many Suburban owners find them to be durable vehicles when properly maintained, with the 6.0L engine and 4L80-E transmission offering greater robustness.
