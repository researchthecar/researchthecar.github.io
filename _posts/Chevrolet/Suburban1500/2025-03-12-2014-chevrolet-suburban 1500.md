The 2014 Chevrolet Suburban 1500 is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capability, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 5.3L V8, rated at 320 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. There are no other engine or transmission options for this model year. Owners often praised its ability to haul large families and cargo, as well as its smooth highway cruising. Common complaints revolved around its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and fuel economy that is typical for this type of large SUV.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8 (LMG)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifter failure occurs when the AFM lifters collapse, leading to misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. This can also cause the check engine light to illuminate, often with codes related to misfires or cylinder deactivation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed AFM lifters with updated versions or deleting the AFM system altogether. This involves removing the cylinder heads, replacing the lifters, and potentially replacing the camshaft if damaged. Many owners choose to disable AFM through a tuner to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can occur due to issues with piston rings or the AFM system. Owners report needing to add oil frequently between oil changes. This can also lead to fouled spark plugs and catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Repair typically involves replacing the piston rings or addressing issues with the AFM system. Performing an engine flush can help with oil control ring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil pressure sensor can fail, resulting in inaccurate oil pressure readings or a complete loss of reading. The check engine light may come on, or the gauge will read low or zero oil pressure. This can lead to unnecessary worry about low oil pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oil pressure sensor. The sensor is located behind the intake manifold, making it a relatively involved repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations, especially during light acceleration or cruising speeds. This is caused by the torque converter clutch engaging and disengaging rapidly.
    *   Solution: Flushing the transmission fluid with an updated fluid formulation. In severe cases, replacing the torque converter is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $1,500+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission shifts roughly, hesitates before shifting, or fails to shift at all. This can be caused by worn valve body components or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or transmission rebuild. Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with air suspension, the compressor can fail, leading to a saggy rear end, uneven ride height, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Autoride Shock Absorber Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with autoride suspension, the shock absorbers can fail, leading to poor ride quality, excessive bouncing, and potential warning lights. Leaks can also be seen on the shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty autoride shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains while the vehicle is off, leading to difficulty starting or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various circuits and components to isolate the faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gauge Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic gauge readings, flickering, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear liftgate struts fail, causing the liftgate to fall down or not stay open.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight. This is a common issue in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Suburban 1500, while a capable and comfortable SUV, is prone to certain issues. The most concerning are related to the 5.3L V8 engine, particularly AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, which can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, electrical problems, and suspension component failures are also potential areas of concern. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, as well as budget for potential maintenance.
