The 2019 Chevrolet Impala is a full-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and spacious interior. It came standard with a 3.6L V6 engine producing 305 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. This was the only engine and transmission option available for the 2019 model year. Owners generally appreciate the Impala's smooth ride, large trunk, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints include its somewhat dated design compared to newer competitors and its lack of advanced safety features as standard equipment.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6 (LGX)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil more frequently than expected, blue-ish exhaust smoke, and potential low oil level warnings.
    * Solution: The fix can range from replacing valve cover gaskets and PCV valve to more extensive repairs like piston ring replacement or engine replacement in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Check Engine Light - Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Solenoid Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: A check engine light may illuminate accompanied by diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to the variable valve timing (VVT) system. This could be due to faulty VVT solenoids. Symptoms can include rough idling, reduced engine performance, and decreased fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty VVT solenoid(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (depending on location and if multiple solenoids need replacing)

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting between gears. This can manifest as hard jolts or thumps during acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. Other potential fixes include replacing the valve body or, in more severe cases, transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $3,000+ (for transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart.
    * Solution: Software updates from the dealer can sometimes resolve this issue. If the problem persists, the infotainment module may need to be replaced.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Impala, while generally reliable, has some potential issues to watch out for. The most commonly reported issues revolve around excessive oil consumption with the 3.6L V6 engine, harsh shifting from the 6-speed automatic transmission, and occasional electrical glitches with the infotainment system and battery. While some issues, like infotainment glitches, can be minor inconveniences, others, such as excessive oil consumption, can lead to costly repairs if left unaddressed. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
