The 2002 Chevrolet Impala was a popular full-size sedan offering practicality and decent fuel economy. Two engine options were available: a 3.4L LA1 V6 engine producing 180 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.8L L36 V6 engine rated at 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Impala for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and large trunk. Common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with certain electrical components and the durability of some interior parts.

**Engine**

**3.4L LA1 V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and a sweet smell emanating from the engine bay. This is caused by the original plastic intake manifold gasket deteriorating over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gasket with an updated aluminum or composite gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Stalling, difficulty starting, check engine light illuminated with codes related to the crankshaft position sensor (CKP).
    *   Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L L36 V6**

*   **Lower Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 3.4L, coolant leaks, overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and a sweet smell emanating from the engine bay. This is a known weakness in these engines.
    *   Solution: Replacing the lower intake manifold gasket with an upgraded gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, poor fuel economy, and potential for a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per injector (includes labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4T65-E (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. Slipping can occur under heavy acceleration. This is often related to worn valve body components or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. Sometimes a valve body replacement can resolve the issue if it's caught early enough.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (valve body), $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, particularly when the torque converter is supposed to lock up. Can also trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Noisy steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (for both sides)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Coil Spring Sag/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the car sitting low, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. Can lead to a rougher ride and reduced handling. Springs can break, causing a noticeable sag and clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet Impala is a generally reliable vehicle but is prone to some common issues typical of cars of this age. The intake manifold gasket issues on both engine options are a well-known problem. Transmission issues can be costly to repair. Electrical problems, while not always severe, can be a nuisance. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of repairs when considering purchasing a 2002 Impala. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission work, can be quite costly.
