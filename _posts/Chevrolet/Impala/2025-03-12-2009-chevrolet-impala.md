The 2009 Chevrolet Impala is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It offered three engine options: a 3.5L V6 (211 hp, 214 lb-ft of torque), a 3.9L V6 (233 hp, 240 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.3L V8 (303 hp, 323 lb-ft of torque) which was only offered on the SS trim level. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Impala's reliability, smooth ride, and roomy cabin. Common dislikes include the dated interior design and relatively poor fuel economy compared to newer vehicles.
