The 2015 Chevrolet Impala marked a significant redesign for the model, offering a more stylish and refined full-size sedan experience. Engine options for the 2015 Impala included a 2.5L Inline-4 producing 196 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 generating 305 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Inline-4 with eAssist technology providing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praised the Impala for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and updated styling. Criticisms often focused on the infotainment system, particularly earlier versions, and some reports of reliability issues with specific components.
