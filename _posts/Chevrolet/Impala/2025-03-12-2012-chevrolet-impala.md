The 2012 Chevrolet Impala is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively affordable price point. Available with only one engine option, the 3.6L V6 (LFX), paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (6T70). This engine produced approximately 302 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Impala's smooth ride and generous trunk space. However, common complaints often revolve around issues related to the electrical system, specifically the power windows and door locks, and occasional problems with the engine and transmission.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6 (LFX)**

*   **Timing Chain Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit rough idling, misfires, and a noticeable rattling noise, especially upon start-up. This is due to the timing chain stretching or guides wearing down, affecting valve timing. The check engine light will likely illuminate. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to camshaft position or crankshaft position correlation may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially the camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and hesitation during acceleration. Individual injectors may fail, leading to inconsistent fuel delivery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty injector(s) and replacement with new fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts between gears, a sensation of slipping during acceleration, and potential difficulty engaging certain gears. These issues often stem from wear or damage to the internal components of the 6T70 transmission.
    *   Solution: Typically involves a transmission rebuild or replacement. A rebuild involves disassembly of the transmission and replacement of worn or damaged parts such as clutch packs, seals, and solenoids. A replacement involves installing a new or remanufactured transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrating at highway speeds, especially when accelerating from a cruising speed. Can also cause stalling or difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncing or excessive movement after hitting bumps, reduced handling stability, and uneven tire wear. Leaking fluid from the strut/shock absorber is also a common sign.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected strut(s) or shock absorber(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of struts/shocks replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of one or more power windows. The window may stop functioning or move slowly. Often caused by a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks may fail to lock or unlock properly, either manually or with the remote. This can be caused by a malfunctioning door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Remote Key Fob Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Key fob fails to unlock/lock doors, remote start malfunctions, or the vehicle doesn't recognize the key.
    *   Solution: Replacing the key fob battery, reprogramming the key fob, or replacing the key fob.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulating inside the headlight housings. This can reduce visibility and potentially damage the headlight bulbs.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlight assembly, drying it out, and resealing the housing. In some cases, replacement of the headlight assembly may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**

    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the specific issue (e.g., faulty sensor, wiring issue) and repair or replacement of the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor stops working, resulting in no air coming from the vents. The blower motor may also produce unusual noises before failing completely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2012 Chevrolet Impala, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most significant and potentially costly problems revolve around engine timing chain wear and transmission issues (harsh shifting, slipping, or torque converter failure). Electrical problems such as power window and door lock failures are also common annoyances. While the severity of these issues varies, addressing them promptly can prevent more extensive damage and ensure the vehicle's longevity.
