## Introduction:

The 2015 Chevrolet Impala is a full-size sedan available with a choice of three engine options: a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder producing 196 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6-liter V6 with 305 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3-liter V8 with 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5-liter engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6-liter V6 is available with either the 6-speed or an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 5.3-liter V8 is paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic.

The Impala is praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong V6 engine. However, it is criticized for its uninspired driving dynamics, bland exterior styling, and poor fuel economy.
