The 2014 Chevrolet Impala marked a significant redesign for the nameplate, moving to a more modern and stylish platform. This model year offered three engine options: a 2.5L Ecotec inline-4 (196 hp and 186 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (305 hp and 264 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 with eAssist mild-hybrid technology (182 hp and 172 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Impala's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and updated styling. Common dislikes include some infotainment system quirks and potential reliability concerns, especially in early production years.

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Impala presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the 2.5L and timing chain issues in the 3.6L, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems can be intermittent, but may result in needing a rebuild or replacement of the entire transmission. Electrical glitches with the MyLink system are common irritations. Dashboard cracking detracts from the interior's appeal. While not every Impala will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and inspect vehicles carefully before purchase.
