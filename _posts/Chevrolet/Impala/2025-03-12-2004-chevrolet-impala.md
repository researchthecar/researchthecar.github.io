All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission (4T65-E). Owners often appreciate the Impala's reliability and affordability, while common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling and average fuel economy.

**Summary:** The 2004 Chevrolet Impala is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car of this age, it's prone to certain issues. Engine problems, particularly intake manifold gasket leaks on both the 3.4L and 3.8L engines, and transmission issues with the 4T65-E transmission are common. Electrical issues, such as power window and door lock failures, are also frequently reported. While the repairs aren't typically catastrophic, the cumulative cost of addressing these issues can be significant for a used vehicle. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
