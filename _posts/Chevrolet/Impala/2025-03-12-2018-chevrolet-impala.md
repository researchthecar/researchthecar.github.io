The 2018 Chevrolet Impala is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Engine options for the 2018 Impala include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 197 horsepower and 191 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 305 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Impala for its comfortable ride and spaciousness, especially in the rear seats and trunk. Common complaints include lackluster fuel economy with the V6 engine, a somewhat dated interior design, and a lack of available advanced safety features on lower trim levels.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil level warning light or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: There is no single definitive fix for this issue. Some owners have reported success with switching to a different brand or viscosity of oil. Others have had success with PCV valve replacement. More extensive repairs might involve piston ring replacement, which is a more costly repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $2000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Valve Train Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues related to the V6's valve train, specifically the rocker arm. Symptoms may include a ticking or tapping noise coming from the engine, particularly at idle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected rocker arm and potentially related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or when attempting to pass is also a reported symptom.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change might resolve the issue. If that doesn't work, a software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) may be required. In more severe cases, valve body replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension when driving over bumps, indicating worn or damaged struts/shocks. Reduced ride quality and diminished handling performance are also symptoms.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected struts and potentially related components such as strut mounts and bump stops.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per pair
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. If not, replacement of the infotainment system module may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a dead battery, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for a few days. This suggests a parasitic drain on the electrical system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve testing individual circuits and components to identify the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracking Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight. The cracking can be unsightly and may worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire dashboard. Dashboard covers are a less expensive option to hide the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction or complete failure of the heated seats, where the seat fails to warm up, or only warms up partially.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the seat heater element or the seat heater control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Chevrolet Impala presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While it's generally a reliable vehicle, certain problems like excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, valve train issues in the 3.6L engine, transmission shifting problems, and electrical gremlins can be a concern. The cost of these repairs varies significantly, from relatively inexpensive software updates to more costly engine or transmission work. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially serious mechanical failures, highlighting the importance of a thorough pre-purchase inspection and awareness of these common complaints.
