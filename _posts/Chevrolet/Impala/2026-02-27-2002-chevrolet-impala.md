### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet Impala is a generally dependable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the engine's intake manifold gaskets and head gaskets, especially on the 3.8L variants. Transmission problems, primarily with the 4T65E, such as torque converter shudder and solenoid failures, are also noted. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear over time. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can occur. Exterior rust, particularly in colder climates, and interior climate control issues are also common. Despite these potential concerns, with proper maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the Impala can remain a functional and cost-effective daily driver.
