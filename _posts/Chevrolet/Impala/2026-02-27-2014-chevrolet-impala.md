### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Chevrolet Impala presents a mixed reliability profile. The powertrain, particularly the 3.6L V6 engine, has some documented concerns like timing chain wear and intake manifold leaks, while the automatic transmission can experience shifting issues and torque converter problems. Suspension components such as struts and ball joints are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are present. However, the exterior and interior generally hold up well without significant widespread defects. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating potential repair costs.
