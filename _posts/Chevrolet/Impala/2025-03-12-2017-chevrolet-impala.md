The 2017 Chevrolet Impala is a full-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and spacious interior. Available engine options include a 2.5L 4-cylinder engine producing 197 horsepower and 191 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 engine producing 305 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Impala's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample trunk space. Some common complaints include the infotainment system's responsiveness, the relatively bland exterior styling, and the fuel economy of the V6 engine, particularly in city driving.

**Engine**

**2.5L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating and the engine running rough or making unusual noises.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the PCV valve has resolved the issue. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for PCV valve replacement, $2,000 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult starting, rough idling, lack of power, or engine stalling. Check engine light may be illuminated with codes relating to fuel pressure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1,200
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Check engine light may illuminate with codes relating to timing. Can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. Hesitation when accelerating is also reported.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. Other cases may require valve body replacement or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for software update, $800 - $1,500 for valve body replacement, $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement.

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll in turns, leaking fluid from struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle (pair of struts/shocks).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. Issues may include loss of audio, navigation problems, or inability to control climate settings.
    *   Solution: Try performing a system reset. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery may drain prematurely, resulting in difficulty starting or a dead battery. This can be caused by a parasitic drain, where an electrical component continues to draw power even when the vehicle is off.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve testing various electrical components and circuits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Impala has some common issues, but is generally a dependable car. The most prevalent issues include problems with excessive oil consumption (2.5L), timing chain wear (3.6L), fuel pump failure (3.6L), harsh shifting (6-speed transmission), infotainment system issues, and potential battery drain.
