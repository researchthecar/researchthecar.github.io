The 2013 Chevrolet Impala was a transitional year for the model, representing the last of the W-body generation while also introducing the new Impala Limited that carried over into the 2014-2016 model years. Two engine options were available: a 3.6L V6 engine that produced 300 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 "eAssist" engine with 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Impala's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and large trunk, but some disliked the dated interior styling (especially on the W-body version) and the relatively poor fuel economy compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**
*   **Timing Chain Wear/Stretching**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, specifically with codes relating to camshaft/crankshaft correlation. Rattling noise upon startup, rough idling, and potential misfires can occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warning light, excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes, and potential blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: This can be due to a number of internal issues such as worn piston rings or valve seals. Some success has been found with using a heavier weight oil, but the proper fix would be an engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $7000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4 "eAssist"**
*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The eAssist system utilizes a lithium-ion battery pack. Premature battery degradation, leading to a loss of the eAssist function (auto-stop/start), reduced fuel economy, and potential error messages.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the eAssist battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Both Engines - 6T70 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, especially at highway speeds. Possible transmission slipping or harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter and potentially a transmission flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wave Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or complete loss of certain gears. Check Engine Light illuminated.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild to replace the failed wave plate (a common issue in the 6T70 transmission).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Worn strut mounts can also affect alignment.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts. It's recommended to replace both sides at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent radio operation, frozen screen, loss of audio, or complete failure of the infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates may sometimes resolve the issue. In other cases, the radio/infotainment unit needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Key Fob Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Key fob stops working intermittently, requiring repeated attempts to unlock the doors or start the car.
    *   Solution: Replacing the key fob battery, or reprogramming the key fob. In some cases, the receiver may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight housing seal, or replacing the entire headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air coming from the vents.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the air conditioning system. This could include recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, condenser, or other components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Chevrolet Impala, while generally a reliable car, does have some common issues to watch out for. The 3.6L V6 engine is known for timing chain wear and potential oil consumption. The 6T70 transmission, found in both engine options, can suffer from torque converter and wave plate failures. Electrical issues, such as radio malfunctions and key fob problems, are also relatively common. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of them and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchasing. The timing chain and transmission issues can be quite expensive to repair, whereas other issues such as electrical or suspension issues are less severe.
