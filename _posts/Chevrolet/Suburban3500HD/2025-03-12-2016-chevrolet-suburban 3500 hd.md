The 2016 Chevrolet Suburban 3500HD is a heavy-duty, full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a 6.0L Vortec V8 engine producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. It was paired to a 6L90 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Suburban's large cargo area, seating capacity, and ability to handle heavy loads. Common dislikes include its large size making it difficult to maneuver, fuel economy, and occasional reliability issues.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifters can fail, leading to misfires, rough idling, and a ticking noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters and possibly the camshaft. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, sometimes exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. Can be caused by worn valve seals, piston rings, or issues related to the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the root cause. Repair options range from replacing valve seals or piston rings to addressing AFM-related issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt during light acceleration, typically at lower speeds. Often caused by deterioration of the torque converter clutch.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the torque converter. A fluid flush with updated fluid can sometimes temporarily alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or harsh shifts between gears, particularly when cold. Could be caused by a faulty valve body, worn solenoids, or low transmission fluid level.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the harsh shifting. Could involve replacing the valve body, solenoids, or performing a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle has rear air suspension, the compressor can fail, leading to the rear of the vehicle sagging or not maintaining proper ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor. It's also important to check for leaks in the air lines or air springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs can sag or even crack over time, especially if the vehicle is frequently used for towing or hauling heavy loads. This can lead to a loss of ride height and reduced load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery can drain quickly, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve the issue. In some cases, the entire infotainment system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $1,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
