The 2019 Chevrolet Suburban 3500 HD is a heavy-duty, full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and overall ruggedness. Engine options included a 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. There was also a Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8 producing 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed Allison Automatic transmission. Owners often praise its capability for hauling and passenger comfort, but common complaints revolve around its fuel economy, size (making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces), and the ride quality, which can be stiff due to its heavy-duty suspension.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illuminated. Often occurs at lower mileages. Can lead to camshaft damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM can be disabled through tuning to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil, low oil level between changes, blue smoke from exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV valve can help. More severe cases might require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, hard starting.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the faulty injector(s), followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (per injector or set)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light related to DEF system, poor engine performance, potential "reduced power" mode. Can stem from a faulty DEF injector, sensor, or pump.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the specific DEF system component. Could involve flushing the DEF tank and lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Used with both 6.0L Gas and 6.6L Diesel)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration or shudder felt during light acceleration or cruising speeds. Often most noticeable between 40-60 mph.
    *   Solution: Replacement of torque converter. A fluid flush might temporarily alleviate the issue in mild cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, sometimes accompanied by a clunking noise. Can lead to transmission slipping, particularly under load.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low fluid level, worn valve body, or internal damage. Start with a fluid flush and filter change. More extensive repairs may require valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (flush) - $5,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than the front, especially when loaded. Leaf springs may show signs of cracking or fatigue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaf springs, possibly with heavier-duty versions to accommodate frequent towing or hauling. Air suspension components (if equipped) should also be inspected.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magneride Shock Absorber Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, bouncy or unstable feeling, error messages related to the suspension system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed Magneride shock absorber(s). These shocks are significantly more expensive than standard shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Glitching**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or exhibits glitches.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery frequently drains, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws. A faulty module, aftermarket accessory, or failing battery could be the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters fail to operate or overheat.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Suburban 3500 HD, while a capable and spacious vehicle, does exhibit some common issues. Engine problems, particularly AFM lifter failure in the 6.0L and potential fuel injector issues in the 6.6L diesel, can be costly to repair. Transmission shudder and suspension issues also surface frequently. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches, are less severe but can be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly for preventative maintenance and repairs. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, from relatively minor electrical fixes to major engine overhauls.
