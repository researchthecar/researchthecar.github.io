**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Suburban 3500 HD, while a capable vehicle, does have some common issues. Engine problems such as AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption can be quite costly, as can transmission issues like torque converter shudder. Suspension issues such as leaf spring sagging are common on heavy duty trucks that tend to haul a lot of weight. Electrical problems and interior comfort issues can also arise. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs can easily exceed several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchasing.
