**Engine**

**6.0L V8**

* **Intake manifold failure:** This issue can cause engine overheating, reduced power output, and poor fuel economy. The intake manifold may crack or warp, leading to coolant and/or oil leaks. Replacing the intake manifold can cost around $1,000 - $1,500+.
* **Fuel injector failure:** Faulty fuel injectors can result in misfires, rough idling, and increased fuel consumption. Replacing the fuel injectors typically costs $500 - $1,000+ per injector.

* **Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system problems:** The EGR system can malfunction, resulting in increased emissions, reduced fuel economy, and engine performance issues. Repairing or replacing EGR components can range from $500 - $1,500+.

**Transmission**

**6-speed Automatic**

* **Slipping or shuddering:** The transmission may slip or shudder when shifting gears. This can be caused by worn clutches or other internal components. A transmission rebuild or replacement can cost $2,000 - $4,000+.

**8-speed Automatic**

* **Shifting problems:** Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifting with the 8-speed transmission. This can be caused by software issues or mechanical problems. Updating transmission software or replacing components may be necessary.
