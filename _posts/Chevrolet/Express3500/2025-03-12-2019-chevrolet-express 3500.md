The 2019 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, often configured for cargo transport, passenger transport (as a shuttle or conversion van), or as a cutaway chassis for various applications. Engine options for this model year include a 4.3L LV1 V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L L96 V8 (341 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.8L LWN Duramax Turbo-Diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque), although the 2.8L diesel may not have been available for the 3500 series. The 4.3L V6 and 6.0L V8 engines are typically paired with a 6L90E 6-speed automatic transmission. Common praises for the Express include its robust powertrain options and overall utility, while criticisms often focus on its outdated design, fuel economy, and relatively basic interior.

**Engine**

**4.3L LV1 V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may appear around the oil pan gasket, valve cover gaskets, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Clean the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the leak location and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L L96 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, is prone to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough running, misfires, and potential damage to the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption. Requires checking the oil more frequently than the manual states.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L LWN Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the DEF system, including sensor failures, pump malfunctions, or crystallization within the system. Symptoms include a check engine light, reduced engine power, and messages related to DEF levels or quality.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty sensors, repair or replace the DEF pump, and clean out any crystallized DEF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the specific component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L90E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or erratic shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Transmission may slip or fail to engage properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking the transmission fluid level and condition, inspecting the valve body for debris, and potentially replacing solenoids or other internal components. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid check) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs sagging prematurely, especially when carrying heavy loads. This can affect ride height, handling, and load capacity. Cracking of leaf springs is also possible.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with new or upgraded units. Consider heavier-duty springs if the vehicle frequently carries heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on the quality of the replacement springs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failures of various sensors throughout the vehicle, such as ABS sensors, wheel speed sensors, or oxygen sensors. Symptoms vary depending on the affected sensor but often include a check engine light, reduced performance, or malfunctioning systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor and replace it. Clear any associated diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the sensor and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the wiring harness, including chafing, corrosion, or loose connections. This can cause a variety of electrical issues, from intermittent malfunctions to complete system failures.
    *   Solution: Inspect the wiring harness for damage and repair or replace damaged sections. Ensure all connections are clean and secure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties opening or closing the sliding side door (if equipped). This could be due to worn rollers, damaged tracks, or malfunctioning latches.
    *   Solution: Replace the rollers, repair or replace the tracks, or adjust/replace the latches.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents. This may be intermittent at first, then become permanent.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor. Check the blower motor resistor as well, as it can sometimes cause similar symptoms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seatbelt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the seatbelts, such as difficulty retracting or buckling, or the seatbelt light staying on.
    *   Solution: Inspect the seatbelt mechanism for damage or obstructions. Clean or replace the seatbelt assembly.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Express 3500, while a reliable workhorse, is subject to certain common issues. Engine problems, especially related to AFM lifters on the 6.0L V8, can be expensive to address. Transmission issues like harsh shifting are also a concern. Other potential problems include suspension sagging, electrical sensor failures, and HVAC malfunctions. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can lead to significant repair bills, making pre-purchase inspection and a thorough understanding of the vehicle's maintenance history essential.
