The 2024 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, offering a robust platform for cargo and passenger transportation. Available engine options include a 6.6L V8 engine producing 401 horsepower and 464 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel producing 181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 6.6L V8 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and the 2.8L diesel is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Express 3500's spaciousness, payload capacity, and relatively straightforward maintenance. Common dislikes often include the van's dated design, fuel economy, and basic interior features. The Express Van has remained relatively unchanged since the early 2000s, meaning a lot of the bugs have been sorted out.

**Engine**

**6.6L V8**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil light coming on or visibly low oil levels on the dipstick.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If excessive consumption is observed, a dealer inspection may be necessary to check for leaks or other underlying issues. Depending on the cause, potential repairs could involve replacing valve seals or piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause. Leak repairs may be relatively inexpensive ($100 - $500+), while internal engine work could cost significantly more ($1,000 - $5,000+).
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

* **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The DEF system, which helps reduce emissions, can sometimes experience issues. Symptoms may include warning lights related to DEF level or DEF quality, or even reduced engine power. Faulty sensors or a malfunctioning DEF injector are potential causes.
    * Solution: Start by checking DEF levels and ensuring the DEF fluid is of good quality. If problems persist, a dealer diagnosis is recommended to pinpoint the exact issue. Repair could involve replacing sensors, injectors, or even the DEF pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the component that requires repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.6L V8)**

No Issues Found

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel)**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds.
    * Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, a dealer inspection is recommended to diagnose potential issues with the valve body or other internal components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush and filter change is typically $200 - $400. Valve body repair or replacement could range from $500 - $2,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Often caused by friction between the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Applying grease or lubricant between the leaf springs. If the squeaking persists, inspecting the leaf spring bushings for wear and replacing them as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lubrication is inexpensive. Bushing replacement can range from $200 - $500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a short period of time, preventing the vehicle from starting.
    *   Solution: Testing the battery's health and replacing it if necessary. Checking for parasitic draws on the electrical system by using a multimeter to identify circuits that are drawing current when the vehicle is off. Repairing or replacing faulty components causing the draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: New battery $100 - $300. Parasitic draw diagnosis and repair $100 - $500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Side Mirror Vibration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration of the side mirrors, especially at highway speeds. This can make it difficult to see clearly.
    * Solution: Tightening the mirror housing. If the vibration persists, the mirror assembly may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on whether tightening is sufficient or replacement is needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noises coming from within the dashboard, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the rattle and securing loose components. Adding foam padding or insulation to dampen vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Chevrolet Express 3500 appears to be a fairly reliable vehicle, with reported issues generally being minor and often associated with a commercial vehicle's typical wear and tear. The most significant potential issue seems to be related to the transmission shifting with the 2.8L Duramax, which can be more costly to repair. Oil consumption with the 6.6L is worth monitoring, while other issues like suspension squeaks and interior rattles are more of a nuisance than a major mechanical concern. Overall, diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly should help ensure a long and reliable service life for the Express 3500.
