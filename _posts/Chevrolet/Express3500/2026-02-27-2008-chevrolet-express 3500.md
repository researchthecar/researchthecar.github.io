### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly for its intended commercial use. The gasoline V8 engines are known for their durability, though the Active Fuel Management system on the 5.3L can be a point of concern. The diesel engine, while robust, may encounter issues with glow plugs or injectors. Transmission reliability is decent, but common issues like torque converter problems or solenoid failures can arise, especially with higher mileage or heavy use. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are typical wear items for a vehicle of this size and purpose. Electrical issues such as alternator or window regulator failures are not uncommon. Overall, with proper maintenance and attention to potential problem areas like the AFM system and transmission cooling, the Express 3500 can provide many years of dependable service.
