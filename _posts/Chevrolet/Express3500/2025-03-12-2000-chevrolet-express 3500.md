**Summary**

The 2000 Chevrolet Express 3500, while a capable van, faces common age-related issues. Engine problems range from intake manifold leaks to fuel pump failures, depending on the engine option. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60E, can be costly. Suspension components wear with age, and electrical problems can cause inconvenience. Interior issues, such as HVAC blower motor resistor failure, are relatively minor. The severity of these issues varies, but many repairs can cost several hundred to several thousand dollars. It is crucial to thoroughly inspect the van and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic before buying one.
