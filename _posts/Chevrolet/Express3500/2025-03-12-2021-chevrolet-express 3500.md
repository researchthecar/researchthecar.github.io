The 2021 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, known for its robust build and cargo capacity. It offers a few engine options: a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft torque), a 6.6L V8 (401 hp, 464 lb-ft torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft torque). The 4.3L is paired with an 8 speed automatic transmission, while the 6.6L is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Duramax diesel engine is paired with an 8 speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its durability and cargo space, but cite its outdated design, fuel economy, and basic interior features as downsides. Due to the platform's age, it lacks many modern safety and technology features found in newer vans.

**Engine**

**6.6L V8**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the oil level dropping significantly within a few thousand miles.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any potential leaks. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement might be necessary, depending on the cause of the consumption. Switching to a higher viscosity oil might also help in some cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the cause)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.6L V8)**
* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hard or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: Inspect transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve the issue. In some cases, a software update for the transmission control module (TCM) might be available. If the problem persists, further diagnosis of the transmission internals (valve body, solenoids) might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+ (depending on the solution)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Failing Starter Motor**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the engine, clicking sounds when turning the key, or complete failure to start. This can be intermittent at first but typically becomes more frequent.
    * Solution: Replacing the starter motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight, leaving the vehicle unable to start.
    * Solution: Performing a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits can include aftermarket accessories, faulty modules, or improperly closed circuits. Disconnecting the battery when the vehicle is not in use can help mitigate the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult opening or closing the side sliding door, often due to misaligned tracks or worn rollers. Can require excessive force to operate.
    * Solution: Inspecting and lubricating the sliding door tracks and rollers. Replacing worn rollers or realigning the door may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no air coming from the vents. Can be intermittent at first, then become permanent.
    * Solution: Replacing the HVAC blower motor. Check the blower motor resistor as well, as this can also cause similar symptoms.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Express 3500, while a workhorse known for its cargo capacity and reliability, is not without its common issues. The 6.6L V8 engine sometimes experiences oil consumption, while the 6-speed automatic can exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical problems such as battery drain and starter motor failure can also occur. Exterior issues are commonly related to the sliding door, and interior problems can stem from the HVAC blower motor. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the van's functionality and longevity.
