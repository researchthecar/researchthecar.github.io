The V8 gasoline engines (4.8L, 5.3L, 6.0L) are robust, though the 5.3L's Active Fuel Management system can be a point of concern. The diesel engines offer power but may encounter issues like glow plugs or injectors. Transmission reliability is decent, with the 4L70E occasionally showing torque converter or overheating issues. Common problems across the board include potential intake manifold gasket leaks on V8s, suspension wear like ball joints and leaf springs, and typical electrical component failures such as alternators and window regulators. Rust can also be a concern on older models. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing specific known issues, the Express 3500 can remain a dependable vehicle for commercial and personal use.
