The 2007 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van popular for commercial use, often used as a cargo van, passenger van, or cutaway chassis for various applications. Engine options for the 2007 model year included a 4.3L V6 (around 195 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.8L V8 (around 295 hp and 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (around 310 hp and 335 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.0L V8 (around 300 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options are primarily the 4L60-E and 4L80-E 4-speed automatic transmissions, though some models may have a 6-speed automatic (typically later in the model year or in specific configurations). Owners appreciate the van's cargo capacity, reliability, and ease of maintenance. Common dislikes include fuel economy, ride quality, and some common mechanical issues.
