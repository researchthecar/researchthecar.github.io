Okay, here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2012 Chevrolet Express 3500, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options. I've aimed for accuracy and consistency in the format you requested.

The 2012 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van known for its durability and workhorse capabilities. It's available in various configurations, including cargo and passenger versions. The 2012 model year offered a few engine choices: a 4.8L V8 (280 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L V8 (324 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (260 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic and a 6-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often appreciate the van's robust chassis and ample cargo space, but common complaints include fuel economy, ride quality, and some known reliability issues.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (typically paired with the 4.8L V8)**

*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, and potential loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change might help in minor cases. More serious cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush) to $2,500+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (typically paired with the 6.0L V8 and 6.6L Duramax)**

The 2012 Chevrolet Express 3500, while a capable work vehicle, does have some common issues. Engine oil consumption is a recurring theme, particularly with the 4.8L and 6.0L V8s. The Duramax diesel can suffer from fuel injector and turbocharger problems. Transmission issues, like hard shifting and torque converter shudder, also appear. Suspension problems, electrical gremlins, and interior component failures add to the list. The severity of these issues varies, and the cost to repair them can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like blower motor resistors to significant investments for engine or transmission rebuilds. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, review maintenance records, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
