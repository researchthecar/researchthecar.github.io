The 2010 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van known for its workhorse capabilities, spacious interior, and robust body-on-frame construction. It was available with several engine options: a 4.8L V8 (280 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp and 338 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque), each paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate its reliability and utility, common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride quality (especially when unloaded), and some specific mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption may occur between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Closely monitor the oil level, and top off as needed. In more severe cases, replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, and reduced power. This is due to the AFM system causing lifter collapse.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters and potentially the camshaft. Many owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption may occur between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Closely monitor the oil level, and top off as needed. In more severe cases, replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption may occur between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Closely monitor the oil level, and top off as needed. In more severe cases, replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, especially between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary. In severe cases, a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs high without a corresponding increase in speed, or the transmission seems to "slip" out of gear momentarily.
    *   Solution: Could be due to low fluid, worn clutches, or a failing torque converter. A transmission rebuild or replacement is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Broken leaf springs can be visually identified.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used for hauling or towing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks on one or more doors stop working.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the rocker panels, wheel wells, and other lower body panels. Common in areas with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which can range from patching small areas to replacing entire panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing on the dashboard, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is the best solution, but it is expensive. A dashboard cover is a more affordable alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
