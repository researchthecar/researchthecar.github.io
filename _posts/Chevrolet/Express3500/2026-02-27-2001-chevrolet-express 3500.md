### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a capable commercial vehicle, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. The Vortec V8 engines can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and, in more severe cases, head gasket issues. Diesel engines, particularly the 6.5L, are known for potential cracked cylinder heads and injection pump problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4L60-E, can experience overheating and clutch pack failures. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also common wear items. Electrical issues such as alternator and ignition switch failures are not uncommon. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these areas, especially if the vehicle has high mileage or has not been meticulously maintained. Regular inspections and addressing minor issues promptly can help mitigate more significant and costly repairs.
