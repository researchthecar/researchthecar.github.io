The 2004 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van known for its robust build, versatility, and capability for hauling and towing. It was offered with several engine options including a 4.3L V6, a 5.0L V8, a 5.7L V8, and a 6.0L V8. The 6.0L V8 produced around 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque, offering ample power for heavy-duty tasks. Transmission options include the 4L60E and 4L80E four-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the van's spaciousness, payload capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design which can be easier to maintain than some newer vans. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, ride quality, and some of the age-related issues that can arise with a vehicle of this vintage.
