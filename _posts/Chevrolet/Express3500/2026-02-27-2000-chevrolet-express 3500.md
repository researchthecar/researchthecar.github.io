### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a capable and durable van, particularly when equipped with the V8 gasoline engines. Common issues tend to revolve around the intake manifold gaskets and, less frequently, head gaskets on the V8s. Diesel models can face cylinder head and injector problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4L80-E, may require attention to the torque converter or solenoids. Manual transmissions are generally robust but clutch wear is expected. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are typical wear items for a vehicle of this size and age. Electrical issues such as alternator and ignition switch failures are also noted. Rust can be a significant concern depending on climate. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing known issues, the Express 3500 can remain a reliable work vehicle.
