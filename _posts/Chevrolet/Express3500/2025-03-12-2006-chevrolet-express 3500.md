**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Express 3500, while a workhorse, is prone to a number of issues primarily related to its age and high mileage. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the V8 engines and potential overheating in the Duramax diesel, are significant concerns. Transmission issues are also common across different engine pairings. Suspension and electrical problems further contribute to the maintenance burden. Rust is also a major issue for vehicles in northern states. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems before purchase.
