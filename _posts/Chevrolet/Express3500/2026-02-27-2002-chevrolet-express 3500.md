### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a generally dependable van, particularly the V8 gasoline engines, though they can be prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and, less commonly, head gasket issues. The diesel engine has its own set of potential problems, including cylinder head cracks and injector pump failures. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4L60-E, can suffer from clutch pack wear. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Rust is a significant concern for older models, especially in corrosive environments. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing common issues proactively, the Express 3500 can remain a reliable work vehicle.
