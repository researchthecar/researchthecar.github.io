The 2022 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, offering substantial cargo and passenger space. It comes with three engine options: a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), a 6.6L V8 (401 hp, 464 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel Inline-4 (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). The 4.3L V6 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission while the 6.6L V8 and the 2.8L Duramax are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Express 3500 for its payload capacity, simple design and aftermarket support. However, some dislike its outdated design, poor fuel economy, and basic interior features.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**
*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, check engine light illuminated, loss of power, and diagnostic codes indicating misfires on specific cylinders. This can be caused by worn spark plugs, faulty ignition coils, or fuel injector issues.
    *   Solution: Replace spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors as needed. Diagnose and repair any vacuum leaks that may be causing the misfire.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
