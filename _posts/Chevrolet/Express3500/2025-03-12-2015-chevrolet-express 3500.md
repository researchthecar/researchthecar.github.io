The 2015 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van known for its robust build, cargo capacity, and traditional body-on-frame construction. The 2015 model year offers a few different engine options including a 4.8L V8 (280 hp/295 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L V8 (342 hp/373 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (260 hp/525 lb-ft of torque). The 4.8L and 6.0L engines were usually paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission while the Duramax Diesel was paired with the Allison 1000 transmission. Owners often appreciate the Express 3500 for its simplicity, reliability, and ability to handle heavy workloads. However, some common complaints include the van's dated interior design, fuel economy, and ride quality.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include visible blue smoke from the exhaust, especially upon startup or acceleration, and a noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels, performing oil changes with the correct viscosity, and checking for leaks are the first steps. If consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test may be needed to diagnose worn piston rings or valve seals. Depending on the severity, repair could involve replacing valve seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (major engine work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolt Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue involves the exhaust manifold bolts breaking, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, and a smell of exhaust fumes in the cabin.
    *   Solution: The broken bolts need to be extracted and replaced. Often, this requires specialized tools and experience to avoid damaging the cylinder head. Upgraded, stronger bolts are sometimes recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include visible blue smoke from the exhaust, especially upon startup or acceleration, and a noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels, performing oil changes with the correct viscosity, and checking for leaks are the first steps. If consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test may be needed to diagnose worn piston rings or valve seals. Depending on the severity, repair could involve replacing valve seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (major engine work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (LGH)**

*   **Diesel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The injectors on the LGH engine are known to cause issues. Symptoms include rough running, hard starting, excessive smoke, and a decrease in fuel economy. A check engine light may illuminate with codes related to injector performance.
    *   Solution: Faulty injectors must be replaced. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector (parts and labor). Can easily reach $2,000 - $4,000+ if replacing all injectors.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6L90)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A shaking or vibrating sensation felt during light acceleration or steady-state cruising, typically in higher gears. It's often described as feeling like driving over rumble strips.
    * Solution: A fluid flush, using fluid with the updated formula that is designed to eliminate the Torque Converter Shudder. In some cases, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid flush), $800 - $2,000+ (torque converter replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Allison 1000**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag or even break, particularly in vehicles that are frequently loaded heavily. Symptoms include a noticeable lean to one side, a rough ride, and reduced load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs is the most common solution. Upgraded, heavier-duty springs may be recommended if the vehicle is often used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (parts and labor for both sides).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks. The locks may not respond to the key fob or the door switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) light illuminates on the dashboard. A diagnostic scan reveals a faulty ABS sensor, leading to a loss of ABS functionality.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ABS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350 per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is common on the rocker panels, lower doors, and wheel wells. Especially in colder climates with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involves removing the rust, patching or replacing the affected metal, and repainting. Preventative measures include regular washing and waxing, especially in areas prone to rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per panel, depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seatbelt Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seatbelts not retracting or locking properly.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty tensioner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per seat.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a capable work van with several potential issues to be aware of. Engine issues, particularly with oil consumption and exhaust manifold bolts on the gasoline engines and diesel injector problems on the Duramax, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, like torque converter shudder, are also common. Suspension and electrical issues, as well as body rust, also contribute to the ownership experience. Overall, while the Express 3500 is a robust platform, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision and maintenance budget.
