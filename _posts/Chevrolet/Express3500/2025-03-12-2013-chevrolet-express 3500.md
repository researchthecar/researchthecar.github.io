The 2013 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van, known for its practicality and durability as a work vehicle or for large families. Engine options for this model year include the 4.8L Vortec V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft torque), the 6.0L Vortec V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft torque), and the 6.6L Duramax diesel V8 (260 hp, 525 lb-ft torque). Available transmissions included a 4-speed automatic for the 4.8L and 6.0L V8s, and a 6-speed automatic with the Duramax. Owners often appreciate the Express's spaciousness and cargo capacity, but sometimes complain about its relatively poor fuel economy and dated interior.

**Engine**

**4.8L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address potential leaks. If consumption is severe, consider a compression test to check for worn piston rings or valve seals. If the rings are worn, then engine replacement or rebuild may be necessary. Replacing the valve seals would require removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 (Oil purchase for topping off) - $5000+ (Engine replacement/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found
