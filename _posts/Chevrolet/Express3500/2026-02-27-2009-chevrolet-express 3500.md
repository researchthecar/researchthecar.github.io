### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a capable work van with a generally solid reputation. However, specific engine options, particularly the 5.3L and 6.0L Vortec V8s, are prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter issues, which can be costly to repair. The diesel engine variants can experience glow plug and injector problems. Transmission reliability is decent, though the 4L80-E may develop torque converter or solenoid issues. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear over time due to the van's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues such as alternator and window regulator failures are also noted. Overall, while not immune to problems, many of the reported issues are common for vehicles in this class and age, especially when used for demanding tasks.
