The 2017 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van known for its durability and versatility, often used for commercial purposes, hauling cargo, or as a base for conversion vans. Available engine options include a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L V8 (341 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). The 6.0L V8 is the most popular engine. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Express 3500 for its robust build, towing capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design, which makes it easier to maintain than some modern vans. However, some common complaints include the van's dated interior, lower fuel economy compared to newer vans, and handling characteristics.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**
*   **No Issues Found**

**6.0L V8**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, low oil level warnings, and the need to add oil more frequently than usual.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using a higher viscosity oil may help to reduce the problem. In severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **AFM (Active Fuel Management) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature failure of the AFM lifters in the 6.0L V8. Symptoms may include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough running, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed AFM lifters, and in some cases, the camshaft. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**
*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system, including sensor failures and pump failures, can trigger warning lights and potentially limit the vehicle's speed or cause it to shut down.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty DEF system components (sensor, pump, etc.) or cleaning the DEF injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**
*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a shudder or vibration during light acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This is often attributed to torque converter issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or performing a transmission flush with updated fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or slipping during gear changes.
    * Solution: Possible causes could be low transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal wear. A transmission flush might temporarily alleviate the issue, but a more permanent fix may involve valve body repair or replacement, or even a full transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaf Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy-duty nature of the Express 3500, the rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially when frequently loaded to their maximum capacity. Broken leaf springs are also possible. This leads to a lower ride height in the rear, poor handling, and potential tire wear issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear leaf springs with either OEM replacements or aftermarket heavy-duty options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight or within a few days of inactivity. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of one or more door lock actuators, causing the affected door(s) to not lock or unlock properly using the key fob or interior switches.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Door Roller Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding side door due to worn or damaged rollers. This can cause the door to bind or stick.
    *   Solution: Replacing the side door rollers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents. This can be caused by a faulty blower motor resistor or a failing blower motor itself.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor or the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Express 3500, while reliable in many aspects, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues such as oil consumption and AFM lifter failure in the 6.0L V8 and DEF system problems in the 2.8L Duramax can be costly repairs. Transmission problems with the 6-speed automatic, such as torque converter shudder and harsh shifting, are also prevalent. Other potential issues include leaf spring sagging, electrical problems, and side door roller malfunctions. When considering purchasing a 2017 Express 3500, it's advisable to have a mechanic inspect the vehicle for these potential problems, especially focusing on engine oil consumption, transmission performance, and overall electrical system functionality. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (door rollers) to potentially very expensive (engine or transmission rebuild).
