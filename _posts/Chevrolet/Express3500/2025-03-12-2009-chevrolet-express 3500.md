The 2009 Chevrolet Express 3500 is a full-size van known for its versatility and cargo/passenger hauling capabilities. Engine options for the 2009 model year included a 4.8L V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 338 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were primarily the 4L60E or 4L80E 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and GVWR. Owners often appreciate the van's robustness and towing capacity, but commonly express concerns about fuel economy, ride comfort, and some reliability issues.

The 2009 Chevrolet Express 3500, while a capable work van, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine problems like oil consumption and AFM lifter failure (on some 5.3L models) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60E/4L80E, can also be significant expenses.
