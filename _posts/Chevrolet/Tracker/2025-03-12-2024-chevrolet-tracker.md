The 2024 Chevrolet Tracker is a subcompact SUV aimed at budget-conscious buyers. It's only available with a turbocharged 1.2-liter inline-three engine producing 137 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. The Tracker is praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, it is often criticized for its somewhat lackluster acceleration, basic interior materials, and limited driver-assistance features compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2024 Chevrolet Tracker appears to have some relatively common issues centering around the engine (oil consumption, misfires), transmission (harsh shifting, delayed engagement), and electrical system (infotainment glitches, battery drain). While some issues may be minor and easily resolved, others, such as excessive oil consumption or transmission problems, could potentially lead to more significant and costly repairs. Overall, the severity of the potential issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially major mechanical failures. The estimated cost to fix these issues varies widely, depending on the specific problem and the extent of the repair needed.
