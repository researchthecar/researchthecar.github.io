The 2008 Chevrolet Tracker, known in some markets as the Suzuki Grand Vitara, is a compact SUV known for its off-road capability and affordability. In North America, the 2008 Tracker was available with a 2.0L Inline 4-cylinder and a 2.7L V6 engine. The 2.0L produced around 127 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque while the 2.7L V6 made approximately 185 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (limited availability) and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Tracker's relatively low price point and its true four-wheel-drive system for off-roading, while common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior, fuel economy, and overall on-road refinement compared to newer competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline 4-Cylinder**

*   **No Issues Found**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup or idle. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to camshaft or crankshaft correlation. Can eventually lead to engine damage if the timing chain jumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioners. It's recommended to replace the water pump at the same time due to its location and the amount of labor involved.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking onto the exhaust manifolds, causing a burning smell. Visible oil residue around the valve cover edges.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifting between gears, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. Can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body issues may be present, potentially requiring valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter) - $800+ (valve body)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises when turning the steering wheel, especially at low speeds. Worn strut mounts can also contribute to poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the front strut mounts. It's generally recommended to replace the struts themselves at the same time, as the labor overlap is significant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (struts and mounts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, either intermittently or completely. Can affect one or more windows.
    *   Solution: Check the power window switch and the window motor. Start by replacing the window switch, if that doesn't solve the issue then replace the window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (switch), $200 - $400 (motor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear hatch failing to latch properly, resulting in a "hatch open" warning light on the dashboard. Can make it difficult or impossible to close the hatch securely.
    *   Solution: Inspect and lubricate the latch mechanism. If that doesn't work, replace the rear hatch latch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system blowing warm air. Clicking sound from the engine compartment when the A/C is engaged.
    *   Solution: Replace the AC compressor. Replace receiver drier at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Chevrolet Tracker, while a capable and affordable SUV, does have some potential issues that buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns are related to the timing chain on the 2.7L V6 engine, which can be costly to repair. Other issues, such as harsh shifting and suspension component wear, are fairly typical for vehicles of this age. Overall, while the severity of these issues varies, the potential repair costs can be substantial, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2008 Tracker.
