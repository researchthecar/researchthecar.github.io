### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Tracker presents a mixed reliability profile. While it can be an economical choice, potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the engine (head gasket, oil leaks on the 2.0L; timing belt on the 2.5L) and transmission (slipping, overheating). Electrical components like window regulators and alternators can also be points of concern. Suspension wear, especially ball joints and tie rods, is also noted. Rust can be an issue on older models. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the Tracker to be a functional vehicle if well-maintained and if these common problems are addressed proactively. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
