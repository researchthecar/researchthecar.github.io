The 2007 Chevrolet Tracker is a compact SUV, also known as the Suzuki Grand Vitara in some markets. It offers a blend of off-road capability and on-road comfort. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 and a 2.7-liter V6. The 2.0-liter inline-4 engine produces around 127 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque. It is known for being a budget-friendly and economical choice. The 2.7-liter V6 delivers approximately 185 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, providing more power for towing and off-roading. Some owners appreciate the Tracker's relatively small size and maneuverability, as well as its available four-wheel-drive system. Common complaints include somewhat dated interior styling and fuel economy that isn't particularly impressive for its size.
