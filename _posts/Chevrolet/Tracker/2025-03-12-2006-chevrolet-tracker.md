The 2006 Chevrolet Tracker is a compact SUV that was available in both two-door and four-door configurations. The most common engine was a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 127 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque. A less common 2.5L V6 engine was also available, producing around 155 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. The Tracker was appreciated for its affordability and off-road capability, particularly the two-door models. However, it was often criticized for its dated design, lackluster fuel economy, and reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail prematurely, leading to the check engine light illuminating and potential failure to pass emissions testing. Common symptoms include a rattling noise from underneath the vehicle and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**All Transmissions**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly in the automatic transmission. This can be caused by worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (for fluid and filter), $500 - $1500+ (for valve body repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front strut mounts can wear out and crack, leading to clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the front strut mounts. It's often recommended to replace the struts themselves at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (per side, including struts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the rear leaf springs can sag, causing the rear of the vehicle to sit lower and affecting ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (for both sides)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Tracker, while an affordable and capable small SUV, is prone to a number of issues. Engine-related problems such as catalytic converter failure (2.0L) and intake manifold gasket leaks (2.5L) can be costly. Suspension issues (strut mounts, rear spring sag) are common due to the vehicle's age and mileage. Rust, particularly on the rocker panels, is a widespread concern. Electrical problems like power window failure and headlight socket corrosion can also arise. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as rust repair or transmission work, can be significant. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potential maintenance costs.
