The 2005 Chevrolet Tracker is a compact SUV that was available with either a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing 127 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque or a 2.5L V6 engine producing 165 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
