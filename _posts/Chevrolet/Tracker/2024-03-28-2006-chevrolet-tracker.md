**Introduction:**

The 2006 Chevrolet Tracker is a compact SUV that offers a choice of two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-four and a 2.2-liter inline-four. Both engines are paired with a five-speed manual transmission, while a four-speed automatic transmission is available on the 2.2-liter engine. Despite its modest capabilities, the Tracker's affordability and versatility make it a popular choice among budget-minded consumers. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of issues that potential buyers should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.0-liter Inline-Four**

* **Head gasket failure:** Occurs when the gasket between the cylinder head and engine block fails, causing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and loss of coolant. Repair typically involves replacing the head gasket, resurfacing the cylinder head, and replacing related seals. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The gasket between the intake manifold and cylinder head can fail, causing a vacuum leak and reduced engine performance. Symptoms include rough idling, stalling, and decreased fuel efficiency. Repair involves replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+
* **Timing chain issues:** The timing chain or its components (tensioner, guides) can wear or fail, disrupting the timing of the engine's valves. Symptoms include engine misfires, reduced power, and difficulty starting. Repair involves replacing the timing chain and related components. Estimated cost: $800 - $1,500+

**2.2-liter Inline-Four**

* **Camshaft positioning sensor failure:** The camshaft positioning sensor monitors the position of the camshaft and sends a signal to the engine's computer. A faulty sensor can cause the engine to run rough, stall, or fail to start. Repair involves replacing the camshaft positioning sensor. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+
* **Ignition coil failure:** The ignition coil delivers voltage to the spark plugs. A faulty coil can cause misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine performance. Repair involves replacing the ignition coil. Estimated cost: $100 - $200+ per coil
* **Fuel injector failure:** The fuel injectors spray fuel into the engine's cylinders. A faulty injector can cause a lean or rich fuel mixture, leading to decreased performance, engine misfires, and increased fuel consumption. Repair involves replacing the failed fuel injector. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+ per injector

**Transmission**

**Five-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch assembly is responsible for engaging and disengaging the transmission. A worn or failing clutch can cause difficulties shifting gears, slippage, or a loss of drive. Repair involves replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+
* **Synchronizer wear:** The synchronizers in the transmission help to smooth the shifting process. Worn synchronizers can make it difficult to shift gears, especially when the transmission is cold. Repair involves replacing the worn synchronizers. Estimated cost: $300 - $600+

**Four-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Solenoid failure:** The solenoids control the flow of transmission fluid, which is used to engage and disengage the gears. A faulty solenoid can cause shifting problems, slipping, or a loss of gears. Repair involves replacing the failed solenoid. Estimated cost: $100 - $300+ per solenoid
* **Valve body issues:** The valve body contains valves and passages that direct the flow of transmission fluid. A faulty valve body can cause shifting problems, erratic behavior, or a loss of gears. Repair involves replacing or rebuilding the valve body. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Rear shock absorber failure:** The rear shock absorbers help to dampen the suspension and provide a smooth ride. Worn or leaking shock absorbers can cause a rough ride, reduced handling, and premature tire wear. Repair involves replacing the failed shock absorbers. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+ per shock
* **Stabilizer bar links failure:** The stabilizer bar links connect the stabilizer bar to the suspension. Worn or broken links can cause a loss of stability, especially when cornering. Repair involves replacing the failed links. Estimated cost: $100 - $200+ per link

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator generates electricity to power the vehicle's electrical systems. A faulty alternator can cause battery drain, starting problems, and electrical component malfunctions. Repair involves replacing the alternator. Estimated cost: $300 - $600+
* **Battery failure:** The battery provides electricity to start the engine and power the vehicle's electrical systems. A weak or dead battery can cause starting problems, power outages, and electrical component malfunctions. Repair involves replacing the battery. Estimated cost: $100 - $200+
* **Electrical harness issues:** The electrical harness is a collection of wires that connect different electrical components. A faulty harness can cause electrical malfunctions, shorts, and other problems. Repair involves diagnosing the faulty wiring and replacing or repairing the harness as needed. Estimated cost: $200 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Rust and corrosion:** The body panels and frame of the Tracker are susceptible to rust and corrosion, especially in areas exposed to moisture and salt. Rust can weaken the body and frame, leading to structural damage or safety concerns. Repair involves removing the rust, repairing any damaged areas, and applying corrosion protection. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+
* **Plastic bumper covers fading:** The plastic bumper covers on the Tracker can fade over time due to exposure to sunlight and the elements. Faded bumpers can detract from the appearance of the vehicle. Repair involves replacing the bumper covers or restoring their color through polishing or painting. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+ per bumper cover

**Interior**

* **Seat adjuster cables failure:** The seat adjuster cables can fail, making it difficult or impossible to adjust the position of the seats. Repair involves replacing the failed cables. Estimated cost: $100 - $200+ per seat
* **Dashboard cracking:** The dashboard of the Tracker can develop cracks over time. These cracks may be unsightly and can also create creaks and rattles. Repair involves replacing the dashboard or repairing the cracks. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+

**Recalls**

* **NHTSA Campaign Number 07V322000:** Loss of power steering assist due to a faulty steering gear
* **NHTSA Campaign Number 14V430000:** Fuel tank may leak due to corrosion
* **NHTSA Campaign Number 19V544000:** Airbag may not deploy properly due to a faulty wire harness

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Tracker is a budget-friendly SUV that offers versatility and affordability. However, it is not without its issues, particularly in the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Potential buyers should be aware of the potential costs associated with these repairs, which can range from a few hundred dollars to over $2,000 in some cases. Additionally, rust and corrosion are common concerns, especially in older models. While the Tracker is a generally reliable vehicle, its reliability is impacted by the frequency and severity of these issues.
