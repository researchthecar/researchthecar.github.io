### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Tracker, particularly with the 2.0L engine, generally presents fewer major issues than the V6 variant. Common concerns across models include potential oil leaks and cooling system problems. The 2.5L V6 is more prone to significant issues like timing belt failure and head gasket problems, which can be costly. Transmission issues such as slipping or overheating are also reported. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear out, leading to steering and noise problems. Electrical issues like alternator failure and interior problems such as HVAC blower motor failure are also noted. Rust can be a concern on older models. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas and budget accordingly, especially for the V6 models.
