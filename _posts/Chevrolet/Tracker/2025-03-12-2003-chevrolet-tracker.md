The 2003 Chevrolet Tracker is a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capability. It came in two body styles: a two-door convertible and a four-door SUV. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-four producing around 127 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L V6 delivering approximately 165 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its simple design and ease of repair, while common complaints include a lack of refinement, limited cargo space (especially in the two-door model), and underwhelming fuel economy. The 2003 Tracker is built on a Suzuki Vitara platform.
