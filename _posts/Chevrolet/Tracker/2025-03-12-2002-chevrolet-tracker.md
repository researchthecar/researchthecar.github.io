The 2002 Chevrolet Tracker is a compact SUV that was available in both two-door and four-door configurations. It's known for its off-road capabilities, simple design, and affordability. Engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 producing around 127 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque and a 2.5L V6 producing approximately 155 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate its fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder), ease of repair, and compact size for navigating tight spaces. Common dislikes include a somewhat underpowered engine (especially the 4-cylinder when fully loaded), basic interior features, and potential for rust.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet Tracker is a relatively simple and affordable SUV but, like any older vehicle, it's prone to certain issues. Engine problems (timing chain, oil leaks, coolant leaks, ignition coils) and transmission shifting issues are common areas of concern. Suspension wear and electrical problems are also reported. Rust is a major consideration, especially in areas with harsh winters. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the severity of the issue, but some repairs like timing chain replacement or transmission work can be quite expensive. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle for rust, leaks, and any signs of mechanical issues before purchasing.
