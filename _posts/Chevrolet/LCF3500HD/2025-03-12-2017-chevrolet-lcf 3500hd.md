The 2017 Chevrolet LCF 3500HD is a medium-duty cab-over truck designed for commercial applications. While specific horsepower and torque figures can vary based on final configurations and upfitting, it was commonly available with a 6.0L V8 gasoline engine, with an output of 297 HP and 372 lb-ft of torque. Another option was a 5.2L inline 4-cylinder diesel engine. The LCF series is generally praised for its maneuverability in urban environments and its relatively tight turning radius. Criticisms often revolve around the utilitarian interior and ride quality, which are typical of commercial vehicles. Common complaints are regarding the lack of driver comfort and the somewhat basic features compared to consumer-oriented trucks.

**Engine**

**6.0L V8 Gasoline**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed to replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed.)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Evaporative Emission (EVAP) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated due to EVAP system leaks or failures. Could be caused by faulty gas cap, leaking hoses, or a malfunctioning purge valve/solenoid.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis via smoke test or code reading. Replace faulty components, such as the gas cap, EVAP hoses, or purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component needing replacement.)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.2L Inline 4-Cylinder Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clogging or malfunction of the DPF system. This can cause reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, and eventually a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF, replacement of the DPF sensor, or DPF replacement if severely clogged. Proper diagnostics is key before replacing parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust. Could be caused by dirty or failing fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Fuel injector cleaning or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on how many injectors need to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison Automatic (Specific Model Varies Depending on Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears. This could be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Some cases can be resolved by performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change. More severe cases might require valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $2,500+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially when the torque converter is locked up.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, especially when loaded. Possible cracking or breaking of leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Leaf spring replacement. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle frequently carries heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per spring pack (depending on the source of part)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Shock absorber/strut replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (for a pair, depending on brand and labor.)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as malfunctioning lights, power windows, or door locks.
    *   Solution: BCM reprogramming or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion or damage to wiring harnesses, leading to electrical shorts, open circuits, and various electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of damaged wiring harnesses. This can be a time-consuming repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
