The 2016 Chevrolet LCF 3500HD is a cab-over truck designed for commercial use, favored for its maneuverability in tight spaces and ease of access to the engine. The LCF 3500HD is designed for many different applications such as a flatbed, a tow truck, box truck, and much more. This model year offers a 6.0L V8 gasoline engine producing 297 horsepower and 372 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.2L inline-four diesel engine producing 215 horsepower and 452 lb-ft of torque. Both engine options are typically paired with an Aisin A465 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the truck's tight turning radius and visibility, but some dislike the limited cabin space and the ride quality, which can be stiff.

**Engine**

**6.0L V8 Gasoline**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The symptom is typically a low oil level warning light or noticeable drop on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels closely and using the correct viscosity oil can mitigate the issue. In more severe cases, engine repairs, piston ring replacement or valve guide replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.2L Inline-Four Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, especially with frequent short trips or city driving, leading to reduced engine performance, warning lights, and the engine entering limp mode.
    *   Solution: Performing a forced regeneration of the DPF may clear the blockage. In severe cases, the DPF may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin A465 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing hard or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change and filter replacement can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body issues may be the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: With heavy use or frequent overloading, the leaf springs can sag or even break, leading to a noticeable ride height difference and reduced load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with new or upgraded versions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as the mass airflow (MAF) sensor, oxygen sensors, or wheel speed sensors, can fail. Symptoms include engine performance issues, warning lights, and ABS/traction control malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific faulty sensor and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion, especially in areas exposed to road salt, can cause shorts or breaks in the wiring harness, leading to various electrical problems.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and repairing or replacing the damaged sections of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame and Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The frame and body panels, particularly in areas exposed to road salt, can be prone to rust.
    *   Solution: Applying rust inhibitors and performing regular washing and waxing to prevent further corrosion. Rust repair and repainting may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor can fail, resulting in a lack of airflow from the vents.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet LCF 3500HD, while appreciated for its practicality, has its share of common issues. Engine oil consumption on the gasoline engine and DPF problems with the diesel engine can be concerns. Transmission harshness, suspension issues, and electrical gremlins can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, but addressing them promptly is crucial for maintaining the vehicle's reliability and performance. Rust is a concern, particularly in colder climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission work, can be costly.
