### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Chevrolet Blazer generally presents a solid reliability record, with its primary engine options (2.5L, 3.6L V6, and 2.0L Turbo) showing no significant widespread mechanical failures. The most commonly cited technical concern revolves around the 9-speed automatic transmission, which can exhibit hesitation and rough shifting, often addressable through software updates but sometimes requiring more involved repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system freezing and premature battery drain, have also been noted by some owners. Exterior and interior components, along with suspension, appear to be relatively trouble-free. Overall, while not immune to minor electrical glitches or transmission quirks, the 2019 Blazer offers a reliable ownership experience for most, provided potential transmission and electrical issues are monitored.
