The 2005 Chevrolet Blazer, a compact SUV, offered a blend of utility and affordability during its time. It was praised for its off-road capability (especially the 4x4 models) and relatively simple mechanical design, which made it appealing to DIY mechanics. However, it also faced criticisms for its outdated design compared to newer competitors, fuel economy, and some reliability concerns. The 2005 Blazer came standard with a 4.3L V6 engine producing approximately 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission.

    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel injector spider, a common problem in these engines, is a centrally located injector assembly with individual lines going to each cylinder. When it fails, symptoms include rough idling, misfires, poor fuel economy, and difficulty starting, particularly when the engine is warm.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel injector spider assembly with an updated design is the recommended solution. Some owners opt for an aftermarket upgrade to individual injectors.
