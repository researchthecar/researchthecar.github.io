### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Blazer is a capable SUV with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly the 4.3L V6 engine. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and torque converter problems with the automatic transmission. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also wear over time. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior issues like sagging headliners or HVAC blend door failures are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and inspection of these areas can help mitigate potential repair costs and ensure continued reliability.
