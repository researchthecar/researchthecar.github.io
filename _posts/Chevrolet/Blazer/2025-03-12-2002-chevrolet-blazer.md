The 2002 Chevrolet Blazer is a mid-size SUV known for its truck-like body-on-frame construction and affordability. It came with two engine options: a 4.3L V6 producing 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, and a less common 2.2L Inline 4. It came with two transmission options: a 4L60E four-speed automatic, and a 5-speed manual.
