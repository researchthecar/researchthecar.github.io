The 2001 Chevrolet Blazer is a compact SUV known for its ruggedness and practicality. It offered a comfortable ride and decent off-road capabilities for its time. However, it's also known for having some reliability issues, common for vehicles of that age. The 2001 Blazer was equipped with two engine options: a 2.2L inline-4 producing around 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque and a more popular 4.3L V6 producing around 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Some owners appreciate the Blazer's affordability and simplicity, while others dislike its fuel economy and relatively dated design compared to newer SUVs.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6 (LU3)**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks (external or internal, leading to coolant in the oil), rough idle, engine misfires, and overheating. Can sometimes be detected by the smell of coolant.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets with updated gaskets that are more durable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector "Spider" Assembly Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, poor fuel economy, hard starting, and check engine light (often with codes related to fuel injectors or misfires). The original "spider" injector design was prone to leaking.
    *   Solution: Replace the entire fuel injector assembly with an updated version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Distributor Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, stalling, hard starting, no start, and a check engine light. Common issue on older engines.
    *   Solution: Replace the distributor. Often the distributor cap and rotor are replaced at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at certain speeds (often highway speeds), stalling when coming to a stop, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Typically done when rebuilding the transmission as a preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (when part of a larger transmission repair)

**Summary**

The 2001 Chevrolet Blazer, particularly models equipped with the 4.3L V6, can suffer from a number of issues. Intake manifold gasket leaks and fuel injector issues are common concerns for the engine. The 4L60E transmission is also prone to problems. Suspension components like ball joints and idler arms wear out, especially if the vehicle has seen lots of use or is located in regions that experience harsh road conditions. While some electrical issues can be addressed relatively inexpensively, extensive rust repair can be costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems before purchasing. While most repairs are not extremely expensive, there are many potential issues which can add up to a hefty maintenance bill.
