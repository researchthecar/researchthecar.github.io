The 2003 Chevrolet Blazer is a compact SUV that was popular for its affordability and ruggedness. Engine options included a 4.3L Vortec V6, producing 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission or a NV3500 five-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciated the Blazer's off-road capabilities and simple design. However, the vehicle was often criticized for its dated interior, poor fuel economy, and some reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2003 Chevrolet Blazer has several known issues, particularly relating to the 4.3L Vortec V6 engine (intake manifold gasket, fuel injector spider, and distributor) and the 4L60E transmission (3-4 clutch pack failure). Suspension components like the pitman arm, idler arm, and ball joints are also prone to wear and failure. Electrical issues such as fuel pump failure and instrument cluster problems are also common. Rust is a significant concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. While some of these issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, others, such as transmission rebuilds and rust repair, can be costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
