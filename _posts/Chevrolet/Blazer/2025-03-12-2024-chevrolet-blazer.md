Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration. Please remember that this information is based on currently available data and may evolve as more 2024 Blazers accumulate mileage and owners report their experiences. It's also important to note that not every vehicle will experience these issues, and this is a collection of common complaints, not a guarantee of problems.

The 2024 Chevrolet Blazer is a mid-size SUV offering a blend of sporty styling and practicality. It's available with two engine options: a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 generating 328 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Blazer's sharp looks, comfortable ride, and available technology. Criticisms tend to focus on its interior materials, rear passenger space compared to some competitors, and the fuel economy of the V6 engine.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged I4**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine hesitation upon acceleration or, in rare cases, stalling, particularly when the engine is cold. This may be related to fuel delivery or turbocharger response.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic scan is needed to determine the root cause. This could involve reprogramming the engine control module (ECM), replacing faulty sensors (e.g., mass airflow sensor, oxygen sensor), or addressing issues with the turbocharger boost control.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A few owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or visible exhaust smoke in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Start with a thorough inspection for leaks. If no leaks are found, a consumption test might be performed by the dealer. If excessive consumption is confirmed, potential causes range from faulty positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve to worn piston rings or valve seals, necessitating more extensive engine work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve) - $3000+ (engine rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (Applies to both 2.0L Turbo and 3.6L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted instances of harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating or a delay in shifting can also occur.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid level check and inspection for leaks. A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, valve body issues or internal transmission damage may necessitate repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $4000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear, like failing ball joints, tie rod ends, or sway bar links. Symptoms may include clunking noises from the front end, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience occasional glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, or connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset or check for software updates. If the problem persists, a dealer visit may be required to diagnose and repair or replace the infotainment system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (infotainment replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the vehicle's battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle sits unused for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. This could be caused by a faulty module, accessory, or wiring issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complaints of rattling noises emanating from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and secure or dampen the affected area. This may involve adding foam padding, tightening fasteners, or replacing clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) - $300+ (dealer repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Power Liftgate**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have complained of issues with the power liftgate functioning correctly, sometimes failing to open or close, opening only partially, or making unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: The liftgate struts or the liftgate motor could be the problem, resulting in it needing to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
