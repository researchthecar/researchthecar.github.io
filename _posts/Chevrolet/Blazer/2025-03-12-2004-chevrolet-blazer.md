**Summary**

The 2004 Chevrolet Blazer, while a capable and affordable SUV, has its share of common issues. The most significant and costly problems typically revolve around the transmission, particularly the 4L60E automatic, and engine issues such as the intake manifold gasket and fuel injector problems in the 4.3L V6. Suspension wear and tear, especially the ball joints and leaf springs, are also common. Electrical problems like fuel gauge inaccuracy and ABS sensor failure can be annoying and potentially unsafe. Rust is a concern, especially in colder climates. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, transmission and extensive rust repair can be quite costly, making a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing a used 2004 Blazer.
