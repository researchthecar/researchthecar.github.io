The 2000 Chevrolet Blazer is a compact SUV known for its truck-like body-on-frame construction, making it relatively durable and capable off-road. It was available with two engine options: a 4.3L Vortec V6 producing 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, and a less common 2.2L Inline-4 producing 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. The 4.3L was paired with either a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission or a NV3500 5-speed manual transmission, while the 2.2L was only paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate its relatively low price point, capable 4x4 system, and straightforward mechanical design that is easy to work on. Common complaints include poor fuel economy (especially with the V6), a somewhat cramped interior, and a tendency for rust in certain climates.

**Summary**

The 2000 Chevrolet Blazer, while generally reliable, has its share of common issues. The 4.3L V6 is prone to intake manifold gasket and fuel injector failures, potentially leading to engine problems. The 4L60E automatic transmission can experience slipping and shifting problems, often requiring a rebuild. Suspension components like ball joints and idler arms are also common wear items. Electrical issues such as fuel gauge inaccuracies and instrument cluster failures can also occur. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with road salt. Overall, while the Blazer can be a good value, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and budget accordingly for potential repairs. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, but addressing them promptly can prevent further damage and ensure the vehicle's longevity.
