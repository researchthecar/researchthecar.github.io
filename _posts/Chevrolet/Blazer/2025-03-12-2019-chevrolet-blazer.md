The 2019 Chevrolet Blazer marked the return of the iconic nameplate as a mid-size crossover SUV. It offered a stylish design and a choice of three engine options. The engine options included a 2.5L inline-4 (193 hp and 188 lb-ft of torque), a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (230 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.6L V6 (308 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Drivers generally appreciate the Blazer's sporty styling and available V6 power. Common complaints include the smaller cargo area than some competitors, some low-rent interior plastics, and the occasionally clunky 9-speed transmission.
