The 2013 Chevrolet Malibu is a mid-size sedan that was part of the eighth generation of the Malibu (2013-2016). This model year marked a significant redesign. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-4 engine (196 hp and 186 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine (259 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Malibu for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and updated styling compared to the previous generation. Common complaints included the somewhat cramped rear seat, the performance of the base 2.5L engine feeling underpowered at times, and some early build quality issues related to the redesign.

**Summary**

The 2013 Chevrolet Malibu, while a step forward in design and comfort, had its share of issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the 2.5L and turbocharger failures in the 2.0L, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, while not as frequent, can also lead to significant repair bills. Electrical problems and A/C malfunctions are less severe but still common and inconvenient. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any existing problems. The severity ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
