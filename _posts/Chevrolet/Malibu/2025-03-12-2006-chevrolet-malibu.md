The 2006 Chevrolet Malibu was a mid-size sedan offered in several trims including base, LS, LT, and LTZ. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 144 hp and 155 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L High Value V6 making 201 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard for both engines. Owners often appreciate the Malibu's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder). Common complaints include reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system, and some concerns about build quality.

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Malibu, while offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior, suffers from several common issues. Electrical problems, particularly with power windows, door locks, and the instrument panel, are frequent complaints. Engine issues, such as timing chain problems in the 2.2L and intake manifold leaks in the 3.5L, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission problems can also be costly. While not all Malibus will experience all of these issues, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. The severity and cost of these issues range from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars.
