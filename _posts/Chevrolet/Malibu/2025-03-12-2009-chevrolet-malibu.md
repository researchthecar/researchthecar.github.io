The 2009 Chevrolet Malibu is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. It was available with three engine options: a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 (169 hp, 160 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L V6 (219 hp, 219 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.6L V6 (252 hp, 251 lb-ft of torque). The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5L and 3.6L engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Malibu for its spacious interior, quiet cabin, and smooth ride. However, common complaints include electrical issues, transmission problems, and some engine-related concerns.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet Malibu has some notable issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly timing chain wear in the 2.4L engine, and intake manifold gaskets in the V6s, can lead to costly repairs. The transmission, especially the 6-speed automatic, is also a potential source of trouble. Electrical issues are prevalent and can range from minor inconveniences to major immobilizer problems. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, potentially making the long-term ownership of a 2009 Malibu more expensive than expected.
