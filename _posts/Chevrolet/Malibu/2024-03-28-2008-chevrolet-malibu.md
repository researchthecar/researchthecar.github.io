## 2008 Chevrolet Malibu

The 2008 Chevrolet Malibu is a midsize sedan that was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.2-liter four-cylinder that produced 145 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. A 3.5-liter V6 was also available, which produced 217 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual transmission.

The Malibu was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and good fuel economy. However, it was also criticized for its lack of performance, bland styling, and cheap-looking interior materials.
