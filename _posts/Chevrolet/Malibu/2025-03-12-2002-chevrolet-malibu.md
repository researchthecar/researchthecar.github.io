The 2002 Chevrolet Malibu was a mid-size sedan offering practicality and affordability. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec Inline-4 producing 144 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.1L V6 producing 170 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T40-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Malibu for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, but common complaints included electrical issues and premature component wear.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, check engine light illuminated (often with codes related to lean conditions), and a hissing sound near the intake manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.1L V6**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, overheating, visible coolant puddles under the vehicle, and a sweet smell.
    *   Solution: Pressure test the cooling system to locate the leak. Common leak points include the intake manifold gasket, water pump, and radiator. Replace the leaking component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Intake Manifold Gasket: $200 - $400, Water Pump: $200 - $400, Radiator: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4T40-E 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, and a general lack of smooth operation. May be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the issue by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or burnt, a fluid and filter change may temporarily improve the situation. However, more serious issues may require a rebuild or replacement of the transmission. Common culprits are worn valve body components or clutches.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid and Filter Change: $100 - $200, Valve Body Repair/Replacement: $300 - $700, Transmission Rebuild: $1500 - $3000, Transmission Replacement: $2000 - $4000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced ride comfort and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts. Consider replacing the struts themselves at the same time, as they often wear out together.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Strut Mount Replacement: $200 - $400 per pair, Strut and Mount Replacement: $400 - $800+ per pair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, either intermittently or completely. Often affects multiple windows.
    *   Solution: Check the power window switch, wiring harness, and window motor. A common issue is a faulty window motor or a broken wire in the door harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Window Motor Replacement: $150 - $300, Wiring Repair: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Headlight/Taillight Bulb Burnout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent bulb failures in headlights or taillights.
    *   Solution: Replace the burned-out bulbs. Check the wiring and connectors for corrosion or damage, which can cause premature bulb failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bulb Replacement: $10 - $50 per bulb, Wiring Repair: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*    **ABS Light On**
    *    Description/Symptoms: The ABS light is illuminated on the dashboard.
    *    Solution: Diagnose the ABS system with a scan tool to identify the faulty sensor. Replace the sensor.
    *    Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on which sensor it is.
    *    Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Breakage**

    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Seat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The driver or passenger power seat fails to operate, either intermittently or completely.
    *   Solution: Check the power seat switch, wiring harness, and seat motor. A common issue is a faulty seat motor or a broken wire.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Seat Motor Replacement: $200 - $500, Wiring Repair: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet Malibu presents a mixed bag of issues. While generally reliable, owners should be aware of potential problems with the engine (coolant leaks, intake manifold gasket leaks), transmission (harsh shifting), suspension (strut mount failure), and electrical system (power windows, lighting). While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others like transmission work can be costly. Considering the age of these vehicles, thorough inspection and preventative maintenance are crucial.
