The 2011 Chevrolet Malibu is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Available engine options included a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 169 hp and 160 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 252 hp and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Malibu's smooth ride and fuel efficiency (particularly with the 4-cylinder). Common complaints revolve around some reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system and some engine components, as well as relatively uninspired handling.

**Engine**

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormal amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV valve can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 (PCV Valve). $1500 - $3000+ (Piston Rings)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or break, leading to rough running, misfires, and potential engine damage. A rattling noise from the engine is often an early warning sign.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: High pressure fuel pump that supplies fuel to the injectors can fail and cause the engine to stall or fail to start. In some cases, the engine will run but not accelerate normally.
    *   Solution: Replace the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Slipping during acceleration can also occur.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can help. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Fluid Change). $500 - $1500+ (Valve Body/Repair). $3000+ (Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or creaking noises coming from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning the steering wheel at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Steering Assist Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete loss of power steering assist, making the car difficult to steer, especially at low speeds. A "Service Power Steering" message may appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power steering motor or module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Key Stuck in Ignition**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The key becomes stuck in the ignition and cannot be removed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ignition lock cylinder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, leading to reduced visibility and potential bulb burnout.
    *   Solution: Removal of the headlight assembly, drying it out, and resealing the housing. In some cases, replacement of the headlight assembly may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Resealing). $300 - $800 (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, make excessive noise, or leak water.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Chevrolet Malibu, while appreciated for its comfort and fuel efficiency, exhibits several common issues. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L and high pressure fuel pump failures in the 3.6L can be costly. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the power steering, can also be problematic. Suspension noise and interior issues with the sunroof add to the potential ownership costs. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common failure points before purchasing.
