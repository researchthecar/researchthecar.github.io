### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet Malibu presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly intake manifold gasket leaks on both engine options and potential transmission problems like slipping gears or torque converter issues with the 4T40-E. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM failures and alternator issues, are also noted. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear out, leading to ride and handling problems. Exterior rust, especially in wheel wells, and interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure and dashboard cracking are also reported. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, owners should be aware of these potential weak spots and budget for potential repairs beyond standard maintenance.
