### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet Malibu is a reasonably reliable vehicle, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The Ecotec 2.4L engine can experience timing chain and oil leak problems, while the V6 engines may face intake manifold gasket or timing chain concerns. Transmission issues, particularly with the 6-speed automatic, such as harsh shifting and torque converter problems, are also reported. Suspension components like strut mounts can wear out, and electrical issues, often related to the BCM or alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Interior climate control blend doors and infotainment system glitches are also noted. Addressing these potential problems proactively can help maintain the Malibu's overall dependability.
