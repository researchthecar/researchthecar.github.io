Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu, categorized by component, engine/transmission option, and including detailed descriptions, solutions, and estimated costs where available.

The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu represented a significant redesign, aiming for improved fuel efficiency, space, and technology. Engine options included a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 160 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 generating 250 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8L hybrid option. The 1.5L engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.0L engine received an 8-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid used a specialized electronically controlled transmission. Owners often praised the Malibu's sleek styling, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes included some reports of unrefined engine performance, particularly with the 1.5L engine, and concerns about long-term reliability.
