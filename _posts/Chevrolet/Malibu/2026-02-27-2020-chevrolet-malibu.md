### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Chevrolet Malibu demonstrates a generally good reliability record, particularly with its more powerful 2.0L turbo engine and standard chassis components. The primary areas of concern tend to be the 1.5L turbo engine's potential for oil consumption and turbocharger issues, and the 9-speed automatic transmission's occasional shifting irregularities. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted but not universally prevalent. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and power seat actuators have also seen some reports of failure. While not a perfect score, most issues are repairable and do not indicate systemic design flaws across the board. Regular maintenance and addressing early symptoms can help mitigate potential problems.
