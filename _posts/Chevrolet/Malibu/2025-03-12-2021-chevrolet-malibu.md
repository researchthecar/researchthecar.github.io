The 2021 Chevrolet Malibu is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. It comes with a standard 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its user-friendly infotainment system and quiet cabin, while others find the engine performance adequate but not particularly exciting, and the CVT transmission can occasionally feel sluggish. Some reviews of the vehicle ding it for being uninspired and lacking in features compared to some of its competitors.
