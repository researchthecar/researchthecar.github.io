### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet Malibu is a moderately reliable vehicle, with common issues primarily revolving around its engine intake manifold gaskets (especially on V6 models), transmission solenoids, and certain electrical components like the BCM and alternator. Suspension wear, particularly ball joints and tie rods, is also a point of concern as mileage increases. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs can help mitigate these issues and extend the vehicle's lifespan.
