### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Chevrolet Malibu generally presents a solid reliability record, with most owners reporting satisfaction. The most commonly cited technical concerns revolve around the powertrain, specifically coolant leaks and turbocharger issues with the 1.5L engine, and oil consumption with the 2.0L. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting or shuddering, have also been noted for both the 6-speed and 9-speed automatics, often addressable with software updates or fluid services. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system freezing and occasional battery drain, are also points to consider. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread problems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging symptoms are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
