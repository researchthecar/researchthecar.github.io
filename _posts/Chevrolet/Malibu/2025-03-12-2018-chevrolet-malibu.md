The 2018 Chevrolet Malibu is a mid-size sedan offering a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and decent fuel economy. Engine options included a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 (160 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque) paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (250 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque) paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission, and a 1.8L inline-4 hybrid powertrain. Owners often praise the Malibu for its smooth ride and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some common complaints include issues with the electronic components, and some engine and transmission issues.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4 (LYX)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may manifest as low oil level warnings or visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the cause. It may involve replacing the PCV valve, piston rings, or even the entire engine in severe cases. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+, depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation during acceleration or even stalling, particularly at lower speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    * Solution: Possible causes include a faulty mass airflow (MAF) sensor, throttle body issues, or fuel system problems. Diagnostics include checking for fault codes and testing sensor functionality. Cleaning the throttle body and replacing faulty sensors are common solutions.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the failed components and diagnostics.

**Summary**

The 2018 Chevrolet Malibu, while generally reliable, has some reported issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The 1.5L turbo engine seems to have oil consumption issues that are quite costly and need to be looked out for. Infotainment system glitches and battery drain are also relatively common electrical problems. While some of these issues may be minor and easily resolved with software updates, others, such as engine issues, can be more significant and costly to repair. It's advisable to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to check for these potential problems before purchasing a used 2018 Malibu.
