The 2024 Chevrolet Malibu is a mid-size sedan offering a comfortable ride and good fuel economy. It's equipped with a single engine option, a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine, producing 163 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Malibu for its spacious interior, user-friendly infotainment system, and smooth ride. However, some criticisms include a lack of available options and a somewhat bland driving experience.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, visible exhaust smoke, and potentially engine knocking or damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: A diagnosis is required to determine the root cause of the oil consumption. This can involve a compression test, leak-down test, and inspection of the PCV system. Depending on the findings, possible solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or repairing issues with the PCV system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report turbocharger failure. Symptoms include loss of power, engine misfires, excessive smoke, and unusual noises from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is required to confirm the turbocharger failure. Replacement of the turbocharger is typically necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerking, shuddering, or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This is often attributed to issues within the CVT itself.
    *   Solution: Initial steps may include a CVT fluid flush and software update. If the problem persists, CVT repair or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $5000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the CVT. Symptoms include loss of power, inability to shift, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: CVT replacement is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4000 - $7000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing premature wear of suspension components such as struts, shocks, and control arm bushings. This can lead to a rougher ride, reduced handling, and unusual noises coming from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn components are necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per corner, depending on the specific components replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, Unresponsive Touchscreen, Bluetooth Connectivity Problems, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system reset, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, difficulty starting the vehicle, and the need for frequent jump starts. This can be caused by parasitic draws or a faulty battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the source of the parasitic draw, or replacing the battery if it is defective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (battery replacement) - $500+ (diagnosing and fixing parasitic draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary**

The 2024 Chevrolet Malibu, while praised for its comfort and space, has potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine and transmission, with reports of excessive oil consumption, turbocharger failure, and CVT-related problems, potentially leading to costly repairs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain also appear to be relatively common. While many owners experience trouble-free ownership, the potential for these issues suggests that a thorough inspection and extended warranty might be worthwhile considerations.
