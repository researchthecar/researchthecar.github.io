The 2007 Chevrolet Malibu offered a blend of comfort and practicality, making it a popular choice for families and commuters. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 (144 hp, 155 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L High Value V6 (217 hp, 217 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.9L High Value V6 (240 hp, 241 lb-ft of torque). The 2.2L came standard with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 engines were paired with a heavier-duty version of the same 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Malibu's smooth ride and spacious interior, but common complaints often revolved around electrical issues and the reliability of certain drivetrain components.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Stretching**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, particularly at startup or during acceleration. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to camshaft/crankshaft correlation (e.g., P0016) may be present. Engine may run rough or stall.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioner. Inspect camshaft and crankshaft sprockets for wear and replace if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, difficulty starting after refueling, rough idling, and possible fuel odor. DTCs related to the evaporative emission (EVAP) system (e.g., P0449) may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EVAP purge solenoid valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L High Value V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, often external, near the intake manifold. Overheating, coolant loss, and white smoke from the exhaust may occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets. Ensure the sealing surfaces are clean and properly torqued during installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak onto the exhaust manifold, resulting in a burning oil smell. Visible oil residue on the engine block.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.9L High Value V6**

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a lack of power, particularly at lower RPMs. Check engine light with VVT-related DTCs (e.g., P0011, P0014).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VVT solenoid(s). Ensure proper oil viscosity and oil change intervals are maintained.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during TCC engagement (typically at highway speeds). Check engine light with DTCs related to TCC slippage or engagement issues (e.g., P0741).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter may provide temporary relief but is unlikely to be a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, or failure to shift into certain gears. Check engine light with DTCs related to shift solenoid malfunction (e.g., P0751, P0756).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected shift solenoid(s). Consider replacing all shift solenoids and performing a transmission fluid and filter change as preventive maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front or rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning. Worn strut mounts can also affect wheel alignment and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts. It is generally recommended to replace the struts themselves at the same time, as they are often worn as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Coil Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, especially noticeable when carrying passengers or cargo. Reduced ride height and increased risk of bottoming out.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Ignition Switch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting problems, stalling, loss of electrical power, or difficulty turning the key.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical malfunctions, including issues with power windows, door locks, lights, and security system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific BCM failure and either reprogram or replace the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the headlight bulbs.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlight housings and dry them thoroughly. Check for cracks or damage and reseal if necessary. In some cases, replacement of the headlight housings may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per headlight)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Handle Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exterior door handles, particularly the rear ones, breaking or becoming loose.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door handle assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (per handle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate properly, moving slowly, or becoming stuck.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per window)

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Malibu, while generally a reliable vehicle, is prone to certain common issues, particularly related to the engine (timing chain issues on the 2.2L, intake manifold leaks on the 3.5L, and VVT issues on the 3.9L), transmission (TCC and shift solenoid issues), and electrical system (ignition switch and BCM problems). Suspension components like strut mounts and rear coil springs also tend to wear out. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Addressing these problems promptly can help extend the lifespan of the vehicle and prevent further damage. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing a 2007 Malibu.
