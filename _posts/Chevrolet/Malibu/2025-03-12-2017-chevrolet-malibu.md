**Summary:**

The 2017 Chevrolet Malibu presents a mix of potential issues. Engine issues, particularly with the 1.5L turbo (oil consumption, turbo failure), can be costly. Transmission issues (harsh shifting) are a common complaint, and electrical problems (infotainment glitches, battery drain) are frequent and can range in cost depending on the source. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission replacement, can be significant expenses.
