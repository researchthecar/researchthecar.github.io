The 2003 Chevrolet Malibu was a significant redesign, marking the sixth generation of the model. It was available as a four-door sedan and featured two engine options: a 2.2L Ecotec L61 Inline-4 producing 144 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.1L LG8 V6 engine producing 170 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T40-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Malibu's comfortable ride and spacious interior for its class, while common complaints revolve around reliability issues and some uninspired styling elements.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec L61 Inline-4**
*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**

**Summary**

The 2003 Chevrolet Malibu, while offering decent comfort and space, is prone to a number of reliability issues. Engine problems like timing chain wear (2.2L) and intake manifold gasket failure (3.1L) can lead to costly repairs. The 4T40-E transmission is also a common source of trouble, with potential issues including erratic shifting and torque converter failure. Suspension wear and electrical problems further contribute to the overall maintenance burden. Severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major component failures requiring substantial investment. Overall, it's essential to have a pre-purchase inspection conducted by a qualified mechanic to assess the condition of these critical components before buying.
