The 2005 Chevrolet Malibu was offered as a mid-size sedan with a few different engine and transmission options. Many owners appreciate the Malibu for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, especially considering its price point. Some criticisms include the relatively bland styling and some reliability concerns, particularly with certain electrical components. Available engine options include a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 144 hp and 155 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L High Value V6 producing 200 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may consume an excessive amount of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. Drivers may notice blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can resolve the issue. However, more severe cases may require a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to rough running, a check engine light (often with codes related to camshaft/crankshaft correlation), and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L High Value V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks externally from the intake manifold gasket area. May lead to overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise coming from the top of the engine that gets worse as the engine heats up.
    *   Solution: Replace all 12 valve lifters in the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Both Transmissions**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or delayed shifts, or slip out of gear. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, further diagnosis may be required, potentially leading to valve body repair/replacement or a transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. This is often due to worn or failed strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts. Replacing the struts at the same time is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (depending on whether struts are replaced too)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Coil Spring Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, clunking noise from the rear suspension, uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace rear coil springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument panel may experience intermittent failures, such as gauges not working or flickering lights.
    *   Solution: Could require repair or replacement of the instrument cluster. In some cases, resoldering connections within the cluster can fix the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Passlock Security System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Passlock security system may prevent the vehicle from starting, even with the correct key. This is a common issue with GM vehicles of this era.
    *   Solution: Some people have had success with a 10-minute relearn procedure (turning the key to the "on" position for 10 minutes, then turning it off and trying to start). In other cases, the Passlock sensor or the ignition switch needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working or operate erratically, often due to a failed window regulator.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Breakage**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Chevrolet Malibu has several known issues across its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical, interior, and exterior components. The severity of these issues varies, with some being relatively minor and inexpensive to fix (like sun visor sagging) while others (like excessive oil consumption or transmission failure) can be major and costly. Electrical problems, particularly with the instrument panel and Passlock system, are also common complaints. The cost of repairs can range from under $100 to several thousand dollars depending on the specific issue and the chosen solution. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect any used 2005 Malibu before purchase.
