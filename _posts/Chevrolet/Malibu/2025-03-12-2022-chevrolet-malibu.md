The 2022 Chevrolet Malibu is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. It offers a single engine option: a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate its fuel efficiency and value for the price, while some common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling, lack of available higher-performance engine options, and perceived lack of excitement compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4 (LYX)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected between scheduled oil changes. This can sometimes be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the issue may be related to faulty Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valves or worn piston rings. Diagnosis involves leak-down tests and compression tests to evaluate the condition of the engine's internal components. Replacement of the faulty parts is the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity and parts needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like a stutter or brief loss of power.
    *   Solution: This issue could be attributed to a faulty torque converter or a malfunctioning valve body. A transmission flush and fluid replacement may resolve the issue, but in some cases, a full transmission replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+ (depending on whether it can be fixed with fluid/programming or transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can disrupt audio playback, navigation, and other features.
    *   Solution: A software update can be the solution in most cases. In some cases, replacement of the entire infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $800+ (for infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera display may fail to activate, display a distorted image, or intermittently cut out.
    *   Solution: Check the camera's connection to the wiring harness and replace if necessary. Replace the camera unit if that is the cause of the malfunction.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports have surfaced of cracking dashboards, particularly in regions with high heat and sunlight exposure. The cracking is typically centered around the instrument panel or center console.
    *   Solution: The dashboard can be replaced, but may be expensive depending on the amount of labor required to remove all the components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to activate, provide insufficient heat, or become excessively hot.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the seat heater element, wiring harness, and control module. Replacement of the faulty component is the repair.
