The 2004 Chevrolet Malibu was a mid-size sedan offering a blend of practicality and comfort. It came with several engine options including a 2.2L Ecotec Inline-4 producing 145 hp and 155 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L High Value V6 generating 200 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque, and later in the model year a 3.6L High Feature V6 rated at 240 hp and 240 lb-ft of torque. The 2.2L Ecotec was paired with a 4T40-E 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5L and 3.6L V6 engines were coupled with a 4T65-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Malibu's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and decent fuel economy. Common complaints include issues with the electrical system, particularly the Passlock system, and some reliability concerns with certain engine and transmission components.
