**Summary**

The 2011 Chevrolet Express 1500 can be a reliable work van, but it is susceptible to certain issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 5.3L V8 (AFM lifter failure and oil consumption), can be costly. Transmission issues such as torque converter failure can also be expensive. Suspension and electrical problems, while less severe, can also contribute to the overall cost of ownership. Potential buyers should inspect the vehicle thoroughly and be aware of these common issues.
