The 2000 Chevrolet Express 1500 is a full-size van known for its versatility and reliability, making it a popular choice for commercial and personal use. Beyond the 4.3L Vortec V6 (195 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), engine options included the 5.0L Vortec V8 and the 5.7L Vortec V8, offering increased power and towing capacity. Transmission options were primarily the 4L60E 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the van's spaciousness and cargo capacity, as well as its straightforward mechanical design, making it relatively easy to maintain. However, common complaints include issues with rust, electrical problems, and certain engine/transmission components, especially as the vehicle ages.
