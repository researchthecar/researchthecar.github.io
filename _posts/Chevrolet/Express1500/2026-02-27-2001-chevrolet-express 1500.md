### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet Express 1500, while a capable and durable van, exhibits common issues typical for its age and platform. The Vortec V8 engines, particularly the 5.7L, are prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and, less commonly, cracked cylinder heads. The 4L60-E transmission can suffer from torque converter clutch issues and solenoid failures. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also wear items that require attention. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can manifest. Rust is a significant concern in certain climates. Despite these potential problems, addressing them proactively can maintain the Express 1500's utility for many years.
