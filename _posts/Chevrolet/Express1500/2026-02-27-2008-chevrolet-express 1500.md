### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Chevrolet Express 1500, while a capable and durable van for its intended purpose, exhibits some common reliability concerns. The Vortec engines, particularly the 5.3L V8 with its Active Fuel Management system, can be prone to issues like oil consumption and related internal damage. Transmission problems, often related to solenoids in the 4L60-E, are also reported. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to wear. Electrical gremlins, especially those stemming from the Body Control Module, and alternator failures are not uncommon. Exterior rust and interior HVAC blend door actuator failures are also points to consider. Despite these potential issues, many Express vans continue to serve reliably with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
