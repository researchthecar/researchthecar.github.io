**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Express 1500 can be a reliable vehicle, but it is prone to certain issues, especially given its age. Engine problems such as AFM lifter failure and oil consumption in the V8 engines are common and can be expensive to address. Transmission issues are also prevalent, potentially requiring a rebuild. Suspension wear and electrical component failures are typical for vehicles of this age. Rust is also a significant concern, especially in areas with road salt. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs to the engine, transmission, or body can be costly.
