### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet Express 1500 is a robust vehicle, but common issues tend to center around the engine (intake manifold gaskets, AFM system on V8s) and transmission (torque converter, overheating). Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also require attention. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and power window motors are not uncommon. Interior components like the HVAC resistor and door lock actuators are also reported. Despite these points, the Express remains a popular choice for its durability and utility, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of a fundamentally unreliable platform.
