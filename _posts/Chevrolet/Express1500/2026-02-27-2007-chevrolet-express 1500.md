### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Express 1500, while generally a robust platform for commercial use, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of its age and design. Powertrain issues, particularly with the 5.3L V8's AFM system and the 4L60-E transmission's solenoids, are notable. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, especially under heavy use. Rust can be a significant factor depending on climate. Despite these potential issues, proactive maintenance and addressing problems promptly can help maintain the Express 1500's utility and value.
