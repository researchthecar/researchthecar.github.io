### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Express 1500 is a capable work van, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with its V8 engines (intake manifold gaskets, AFM system on 5.3L) and the 4L60-E transmission (torque converter, solenoids). Electrical components like the BCM and alternator can also be points of failure. Rust is a common concern for older vehicles, especially in harsh climates. While suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to age and use, they are generally manageable. Regular maintenance and proactive checks for leaks and electrical anomalies are recommended to ensure reliable service from this versatile van.
