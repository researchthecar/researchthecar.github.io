Common dislikes revolve around fuel economy and some reported reliability issues associated with older models.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, rough idle, engine misfire, overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**5.0L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level. Often stems from the rear main seal or valve cover gaskets.
