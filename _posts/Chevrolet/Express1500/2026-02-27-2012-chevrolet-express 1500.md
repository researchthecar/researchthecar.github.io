### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Chevrolet Express 1500 demonstrates a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components are generally robust, owners have reported specific issues, particularly with the Active Fuel Management system on V8 engines and potential intake manifold leaks on both engine options. Transmission issues, primarily related to the torque converter and solenoids in the 4-speed automatic, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can experience wear, especially under heavy use. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM or alternator, and exterior rust in certain climates are other areas to monitor. Interior components like HVAC blend doors and seat wear are common, though less critical. Overall, the Express 1500 is a capable vehicle, but proactive maintenance and awareness of these common issues are recommended for optimal long-term ownership.
