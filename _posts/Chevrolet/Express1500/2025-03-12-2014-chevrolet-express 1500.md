**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced fuel economy, and eventual engine damage. The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but the lifters associated with this system are prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder heads. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether during the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil additions between changes. This can lead to spark plug fouling, catalytic converter damage, and eventually engine failure.
    *   Solution: Some owners try using thicker oil. Others replace the valve stem seals or piston rings, though this is a more involved repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the repair needed
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or a delay in shifting. These are common symptoms of wear or damage to the internal components of the transmission.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change may provide temporary relief. Repair typically involves valve body repair, solenoid replacement, or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,500+ depending on the severity and repair needed
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of power. The torque converter is responsible for transferring power from the engine to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering. The weight of the Express can accelerate wear on the ball joints.
    *   Solution: Ball joint replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced ride height, and compromised load-carrying capacity. The leaf springs are responsible for supporting the weight of the van.
    *   Solution: Leaf spring replacement or adding helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000 depending on whether you add helper springs or replace the leaf springs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to operate, either intermittently or completely.
    *   Solution: Door lock actuator replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a short period, requiring frequent jump starts. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various circuits and components to identify the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Door Hinge Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult to open or close side doors, sagging doors, or squeaking/grinding noises when operating the door.
