**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet Express 1500 is generally considered a reliable vehicle, but age-related issues are common. Engine problems vary depending on the engine option, but intake manifold leaks and fuel injector issues are notable. The 4L60E transmission is a common weak point, and the suspension components wear with age. Electrical issues like fuel pump and alternator failures are also frequent. Rust is a concern in areas with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, particularly transmission rebuilds. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
