### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT, particularly with its larger engine options, can be a reliable vehicle if common issues are addressed proactively. The 4.2L inline-six is generally more robust than the 5.3L V8, which can suffer from Active Fuel Management problems. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60-E, are not uncommon and can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM, and suspension wear are also points to consider. While rust can be a concern on older models, most other components offer reasonable durability for the age. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to reported symptoms are key to maintaining the Trailblazer EXT's utility.
