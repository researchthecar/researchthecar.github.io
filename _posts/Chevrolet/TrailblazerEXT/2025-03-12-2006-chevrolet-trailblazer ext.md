The 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT is a mid-size SUV known for its extended length, providing a more spacious third-row seat and increased cargo capacity compared to the standard Trailblazer. Engine options included the standard 4.2L Inline-6 (291 hp, 277 lb-ft of torque) and the optional 5.3L V8 (300 hp, 330 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 4L60-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Trailblazer EXT for its robust towing capabilities, comfortable ride (for its time), and abundant space. Common dislikes include its fuel economy, outdated interior, and some known reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT has several common issues, ranging from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing ignition coils or sensors to more costly repairs such as transmission rebuilds or air suspension component replacements. Engine issues like oil consumption (particularly in the 5.3L V8) and general age-related component failures are frequent concerns. Electrical problems with the instrument cluster and door locks are also common. Rust, especially in colder climates, can significantly affect the vehicle's lifespan. When considering purchasing one, a thorough inspection of these areas is highly recommended. The severity of the issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
