# 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT

### Overview
The 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT, a full-size SUV built on the GMT360 platform, offered a blend of utility and passenger space, particularly with its extended wheelbase. It was available with robust inline-six and V8 engine options, paired with a reliable automatic transmission. While generally considered a capable vehicle for its time, like many SUVs of this era, it has specific areas that have shown a propensity for issues as the vehicles age. Owners often report on the durability of the powertrain, but attention is frequently drawn to the electrical system and certain suspension components. Understanding these common points of failure can help prospective buyers and current owners manage maintenance and repair costs effectively.

### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT is a capable SUV with generally strong powertrain options. However, as it ages, common issues tend to emerge, particularly in the electrical system with BCM and HVAC resistor failures, and in the suspension with worn ball joints and wheel bearings. Engine-specific issues like intake manifold leaks on the I6 and AFM problems on the V8 are also noteworthy. Transmission reliability is decent, but torque converter and clutch pack issues can arise. Rust on the rear quarter panels is a concern in rust-prone areas. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these common problem areas are recommended for owners.
