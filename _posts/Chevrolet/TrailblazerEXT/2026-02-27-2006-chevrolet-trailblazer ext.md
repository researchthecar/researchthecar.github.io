### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT, particularly with its larger engine options, can be a robust vehicle but is prone to specific issues. Powertrain components, especially the 5.3L V8's Active Fuel Management system and the 4-speed automatic transmissions, are areas that may require attention. Suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints are also common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can cause various system malfunctions. Exterior rust, particularly on the rear quarter panels, is a concern for vehicles in corrosive environments. Interior issues like blend door actuators and dashboard cracking are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
