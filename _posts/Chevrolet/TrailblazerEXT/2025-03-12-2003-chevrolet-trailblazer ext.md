The 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT is a mid-size SUV that offers a longer wheelbase and more cargo space than the standard Trailblazer. The most common engine is the 4.2L Inline-6, which produces 270 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the 5.3L V8, producing 290 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Trailblazer EXT for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and towing capacity. However, common complaints include poor fuel economy, some reliability issues, and a somewhat dated interior design.

**Engine**

**4.2L Inline-6**

*   **Failed Ignition Coil(s)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illuminated. Often, one or more of the ignition coils fail, leading to an incomplete combustion cycle.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all coils at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per coil (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Timing Chain Cover)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of coolant, overheating, coolant dripping from the front of the engine. This is a common failure point due to the gasket material deteriorating over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain cover gasket. This is a labor-intensive job.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Actuator Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, poor acceleration, engine knocking, and check engine light with codes related to camshaft position.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft actuator solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption Issues (Piston Rings)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, fouling spark plugs. The piston rings may not seal properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (This is a major engine repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knocking Engine Noises (Lifters)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking sound, especially when the engine is cold, which may quiet down when the engine warms up. This can be caused by worn or collapsed lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on how many lifters need to be replaced and the extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting gears, noticeable slipping, or hard shifts between gears. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid level.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and filter change might help if the issue is minor. If the problem persists, a rebuild or replacement of the transmission may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush and filter), $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, or unusual noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a full transmission rebuild might be necessary if debris from the failed torque converter has damaged other components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, uneven tire wear. Ball joints wear out over time, leading to excessive play and potential failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints. It's recommended to replace ball joints in pairs (both upper or both lower).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per pair (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, inability to maintain proper ride height, warning light on the dashboard. The air compressor may fail due to age, leaks in the system, or a faulty relay.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air compressor, inspection and repair of any leaks in the air lines, and replacement of the relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.), lights flickering, or the entire cluster going dead. This is a common issue with the early Trailblazer/Envoy instrument clusters.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the instrument panel cluster. Some companies specialize in rebuilding these clusters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on whether it's repaired or replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days of being parked, requiring frequent jump-starts. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty module, wiring issue, or a bad ground.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve testing various circuits and components to identify the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Quarter Panels**
