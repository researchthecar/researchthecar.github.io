### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT, particularly with the V8 engine option, can be prone to powertrain issues such as torque converter failure and Active Fuel Management problems, which can be costly to repair. The electrical system, especially the Body Control Module, also presents a risk for intermittent and frustrating malfunctions. While the suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints can wear out, these are somewhat expected for a vehicle of its age and size. The exterior generally holds up well, but interior components like HVAC actuators and power seat motors can fail. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in possible repair costs when considering this model.
