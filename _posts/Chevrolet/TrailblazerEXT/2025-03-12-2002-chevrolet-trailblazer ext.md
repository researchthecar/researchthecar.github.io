The 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer EXT is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious third-row seating and truck-like capabilities. While the standard Trailblazer offered a shorter wheelbase, the EXT version provided added cargo and passenger space. The primary engine option was the 4.2L Vortec inline-6, producing around 270 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Some drivers appreciated the Trailblazer EXT for its comfortable ride and towing capacity, while others disliked its fuel economy and some reliability issues. The 4.2L engine was paired with the 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission.
