**Vehicle Introduction:**

The 1991 Chevrolet Sprint is a compact hatchback available with two engine options: a 1.0L inline-3 producing 48 horsepower and 52 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3L inline-4 generating 67 horsepower and 75 lb-ft of torque. The Sprint could be equipped with either a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its fuel efficiency and agility, the Sprint has faced some reliability concerns over the years.

**Engine**

**1.0L Inline-3**

* **Head Gasket Failure:** Blown head gaskets can lead to coolant leaks and overheating. Requires replacement of the head gasket and resurfacing of the cylinder head. **$500 - $1,000**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Leaking intake manifold gaskets can cause vacuum leaks, leading to rough idling and poor performance. Replacement of the gasket is necessary. **$200 - $400**

**1.3L Inline-4**

**No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Grinding Gears:** Worn synchronizers can make gear shifting difficult, resulting in grinding noises. Replacement of the synchronizers is needed. **$500 - $1,000**
* **Shift Linkage Malfunction:** Loose or damaged shift linkages can cause difficulty engaging gears or shifting smoothly. Replacing or adjusting the linkages resolves the issue. **$200 - $400**

**3-Speed Automatic**

**No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Front Struts Failure:** Worn struts result in a bumpy ride and reduced handling. Replacing the struts and mounts improves suspension performance. **$500 - $1,000**
* **Rear Shock Absorbers Failure:** Leaking or worn rear shock absorbers affect ride quality and stability. Replacement of the shock absorbers is necessary. **$200 - $400**
* **Sway Bar Link Wear:** Worn or broken sway bar links cause excessive body roll and instability during cornering. Replacing the links restores stability. **$100 - $200**

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** Failing alternators can lead to battery drain and charging issues. Replacing the alternator and belt resolves the problem. **$500 - $800**
* **Starter Failure:** Worn or defective starters can prevent the engine from starting. Replacement of the starter is required. **$300 - $500**
* **Battery Corrosion:** Corroded battery terminals can inhibit electrical flow. Cleaning or replacing the terminals and cables resolves the issue. **$100 - $200**

**Exterior**

* **Rust Formation:** Exposure to moisture and salt can lead to rust formation on the body panels. Regular rust prevention treatments or replacement of affected panels is recommended. **Variable Cost**

**Interior**

* **Door Lock Malfunction:** Faulty door locks can stick or fail to engage, affecting entry and security. Replacing the door lock actuator resolves the issue. **$200 - $400**
* **Window Regulator Failure:** Failed window regulators prevent windows from operating properly. Replacing the regulator assembly restores functionality. **$300 - $600**
* **Dashboard Cracks:** Exposure to heat and sunlight can cause the dashboard to crack or warp. Replacement or refinishing of the dashboard is necessary. **$500 - $1,000**

**Summary:**

The 1991 Chevrolet Sprint is known for its fuel efficiency but has faced some reliability issues over time. Engine head gasket failure is a common concern for the 1.0L engine, while the 5-speed manual transmission has issues with grinding gears and shift linkage malfunctions. Suspension components like struts and shock absorbers require regular maintenance to ensure optimal handling. Electrical problems such as alternator and starter failure can affect the vehicle's operation. Interior components like door locks, window regulators, and dashboard may encounter issues due to wear or age. The severity of these issues can vary, and their cost of repair ranges from minor to major. Regular maintenance and inspections can help prevent or mitigate many of these problems.
