### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet Chevy Monza offers a budget-friendly option, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engines, particularly the 1.6L and 1.8L Ecotec variants, can experience oil and coolant leaks, and timing belt issues respectively. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, may require clutch replacements or exhibit slipping. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are prone to wear, leading to noise and handling problems. Electrical systems can suffer from alternator failures and faulty window regulators. Exterior rust is a concern, especially in certain climates, and interior elements like the dashboard and upholstery can degrade over time. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential problems are crucial for maintaining the Monza's reliability.
