Okay, here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2003 Chevrolet Chevy Monza, based on available information. Please keep in mind that information on this specific model year can be limited due to its age and regional availability. Also, due to the age of the vehicle, many issues will be due to age and wear and tear on the vehicle.

The 2003 Chevrolet Chevy Monza, primarily sold in Mexico and Latin America, was a budget-friendly sedan based on the Opel Corsa. It was offered with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine. People appreciated the Monza for its affordability and fuel efficiency, but often criticized it for its basic features, somewhat unrefined driving experience, and limited safety equipment.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Higher than normal oil consumption between oil changes, often indicated by the need to add oil frequently. May be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Check for leaks in the valve cover, oil pan, and rear main seal first. A compression test can help determine if the piston rings or valve seals are worn. If the rings or seals are worn, an engine rebuild or replacement will be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil leak repair) - $200 (replacement seals) - $1,500-$3,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or unstable idle, stalling, especially when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Clean the IAC valve thoroughly with carburetor cleaner. If cleaning doesn't resolve the issue, replace the valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $20 (cleaner), $50 - $150+ (IAC valve replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Temperature Sensor Failure**
