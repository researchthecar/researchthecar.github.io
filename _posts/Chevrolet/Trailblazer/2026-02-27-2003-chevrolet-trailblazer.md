### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer, particularly with its popular 4.2L I6 engine, is a generally reliable vehicle, but it is not without its common issues. Owners should be aware of potential problems with the intake manifold gaskets, ignition coils, and oil cooler lines on the I6. The V8 engines can experience AFM-related issues. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60-E, often involve the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints are also noted wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. Interior comfort can be affected by HVAC blend door actuators and power window failures. Regular maintenance and addressing these known issues proactively can significantly extend the life and enjoyment of the Trailblazer.
