### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Trailblazer, particularly with the popular 4.2L inline-six engine, is generally considered a reliable vehicle. However, common issues to be aware of include potential leaks from intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines, as well as the possibility of ignition coil failures. The V8 engines, especially those with Active Fuel Management (AFM), can be prone to more significant and costly repairs related to lifters and oil consumption. Transmission issues, while not universal, can involve torque converter problems or solenoid failures. Suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints are also noted wear items. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and interior comfort issues like blend door actuators are also reported. Rust can be a concern on older models, especially in harsh climates. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential problem areas, the 2004 Trailblazer can remain a capable and dependable SUV.
