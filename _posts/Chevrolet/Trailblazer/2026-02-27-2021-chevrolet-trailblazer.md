The infotainment system's occasional glitches are also a minor point, typically addressed by software fixes. Other systems like suspension, electrical components (excluding infotainment), exterior, and interior elements appear to be holding up well, with no common issues surfacing. Overall, the Trailblazer is a reliable choice for its segment, provided potential CVT owners are aware of the minor potential for transmission quirks.
