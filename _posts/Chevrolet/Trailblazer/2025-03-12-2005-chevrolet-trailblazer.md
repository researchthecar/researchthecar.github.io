The 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a mid-size SUV that offers a blend of utility and comfort. Engine options include the 4.2L Inline-6, producing 275 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and the 5.3L V8, which offers increased power and towing capacity. Both engines were paired with the 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Trailblazer's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options, while some dislike its fuel economy and some of the reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer has a mix of reliability concerns. Some of the most common and costly issues revolve around the engine (camshaft actuator, oil consumption) and transmission (slipping, torque converter failure). Electrical problems such as instrument panel issues and blower motor resistor failure are also prevalent. Suspension issues such as air compressor failure are also reported but only occur on Trailblazers equipped with that option. While some of these problems are relatively inexpensive to fix (blower motor resistor), others can be quite costly (engine rebuild, transmission replacement). Addressing these potential issues proactively is key to maintaining the long-term reliability of the vehicle.
