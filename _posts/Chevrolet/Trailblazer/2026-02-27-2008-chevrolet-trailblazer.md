### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Chevrolet Trailblazer, particularly models equipped with the 5.3L V8 engine, can experience issues related to the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, which can lead to costly repairs. Transmission problems, especially with the torque converter and solenoids in the 4-speed automatics, are also noted. Suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or ignition switch, can cause intermittent and frustrating problems. While the inline-6 engine is generally more robust, it's not immune to issues like intake manifold leaks. Owners should be aware of these potential weak points and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs.
