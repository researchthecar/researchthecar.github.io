The 2004 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a mid-size SUV that offered a blend of utility and comfort. Engine options included a 4.2L Inline-6, producing 275 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8, producing 302 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque (available on some models). Both engines were paired with a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Trailblazer's spacious interior and towing capacity, but common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system and suspension.

**Summary**

The 2004 Chevrolet Trailblazer, while appreciated for its space and capability, presents several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems like camshaft actuator failure (4.2L) and oil consumption (5.3L) can be costly. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60E, are also common. Electrical problems, such as instrument cluster and ignition switch failures, are prevalent. Suspension issues (especially if equipped with air suspension) and interior HVAC problems add to the list of potential concerns. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor fixes (e.g., blower motor resistor) to major repairs (e.g., engine rebuild or transmission replacement), with associated costs varying accordingly. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
