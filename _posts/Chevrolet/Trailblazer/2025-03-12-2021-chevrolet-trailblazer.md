Alright, here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer, structured as requested.

The 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a subcompact SUV designed to offer a blend of style, fuel efficiency, and technology. It's available with two engine options: a 1.2-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 137 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 155 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. The 1.2L engine is exclusively paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive, while the 1.3L engine comes standard with the CVT on front-wheel-drive models and an optional 9-speed automatic transmission when equipped with all-wheel drive. Owners generally appreciate the Trailblazer's attractive styling, user-friendly infotainment system, and nimble handling. However, common criticisms include the small rear seat, somewhat underpowered base engine (especially the 1.2L), and occasionally unrefined CVT performance.

**Engine**

**1.2L Turbocharged Three-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Engine Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report excessive vibration, particularly at idle or low speeds. This vibration can be felt through the steering wheel, seats, and floorboards.
    *   Solution:  Some dealerships have attempted to address this by replacing engine mounts or adjusting the idle speed. However, some owners find the issue persists even after these attempts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Turbocharged Three-Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises (whining, screeching) coming from the engine, engine warning light illumination. This can occur at relatively low mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) - Paired with Both 1.2L and 1.3L Engines (FWD)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hesitation or jerking when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This can be especially pronounced when attempting to merge onto a highway.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported that a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can improve the CVT's performance. In severe cases, transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software Update) - $4000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The vehicle may display a warning message indicating the CVT is overheating. Performance can be reduced, and in some cases, the vehicle may enter a limp mode. This is more common during extended periods of driving in hot weather or under heavy load.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the CVT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission - Paired with 1.3L Engine (AWD)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, especially between lower gears.
    * Solution: Software reflash of the Transmission Control Module, or replacement of valve body or entire transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $4000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash entirely. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution:  Software updates have been released to address this issue. Some owners have found that a hard reset of the system (if possible) can temporarily resolve the problem.  If the issue persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $800+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may display a distorted image, flicker, or fail to activate altogether when the vehicle is shifted into reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connection and wiring. Replacement of the camera unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Loose or Detaching Trim Pieces**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Owners have reported that certain exterior trim pieces, particularly around the windows or wheel wells, can become loose or detach from the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Reattaching the trim piece using adhesive or clips, or replacing the trim piece entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer has several reported issues, ranging from minor trim problems to more significant engine and transmission concerns. The CVT transmission paired with the 1.2L and 1.3L engines, in particular, seems to be a source of complaints. Engine vibration and infotainment glitches are also notable issues. While not all owners experience these problems, being aware of them can help prospective buyers make an informed decision and be prepared to address potential issues. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements.
