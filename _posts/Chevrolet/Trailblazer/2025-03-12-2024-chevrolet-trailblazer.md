The 2024 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a subcompact SUV offering a blend of style, fuel efficiency, and technology. It comes with two engine options: a 1.2L Turbocharged I3 producing 137 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3L Turbocharged I3 generating 155 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. The 1.2L engine is paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), while the 1.3L engine is available with either the CVT (on front-wheel-drive models) or a 9-speed automatic transmission (on all-wheel-drive models). Owners often appreciate the Trailblazer's affordability, distinctive styling, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some criticisms include the somewhat underpowered base engine and occasionally unrefined CVT performance.
