### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet Trailblazer, particularly with the V8 engines, can be prone to issues related to the Active Fuel Management system and torque converters in the automatic transmissions. Engine gasket leaks and alternator failures are also noted concerns. While the chassis and suspension are generally robust, wear items like ball joints and bushings require attention. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, can manifest as intermittent problems. Rust can be a concern on older models. Overall, while not without its common issues, many of these are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, making it a potentially reliable option if well-maintained.
