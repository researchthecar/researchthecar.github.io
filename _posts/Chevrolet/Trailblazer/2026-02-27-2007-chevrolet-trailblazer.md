### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer, particularly with the V8 engines, can be prone to issues related to the Active Fuel Management system and torque converters in the automatic transmissions. The inline-6 engine is generally more robust but can suffer from intake manifold and oil cooler line leaks. Electrical gremlins, especially those tied to the BCM, and common suspension wear items like wheel bearings and ball joints are also points to consider. Rust can be a concern on exterior panels. While not universally problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these common failure points and factor in potential repair costs.
