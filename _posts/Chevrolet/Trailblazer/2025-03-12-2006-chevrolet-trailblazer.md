The 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a mid-size SUV known for its truck-like capabilities and relatively spacious interior. Available engine options include the 4.2L Inline-6, producing around 291 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, the 5.3L V8 producing around 302 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, and the 2.8L I4 diesel engine (Only offered in the Trailblazer EXT). All engines are paired with the 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Trailblazer's towing capacity, comfortable ride, and off-road capabilities. However, common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, some cheap interior materials, and reliability issues.
