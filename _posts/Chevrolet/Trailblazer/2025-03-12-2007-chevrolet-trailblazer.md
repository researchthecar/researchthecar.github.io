The 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a mid-size SUV that offers a blend of capability and comfort. Engine options for this model year included the 4.2L Inline-6, rated at 291 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, and the 5.3L V8, producing 302 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Trailblazer's spacious interior, towing capacity, and relatively smooth ride. However, some common complaints include issues with reliability, fuel economy, and the overall build quality.

**Engine**

**4.2L Inline-6**

*   **Camshaft Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may have a ticking noise that becomes louder when the engine is warm. Engine can stall out, idle rough, and lack power. This is caused by wear or failure of the camshaft actuator (also known as the variable valve timing (VVT) actuator).
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft actuator and perform an oil change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, check engine light illumination. Often caused by a failing ignition coil on one or more cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (per coil)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption may be experienced, especially in higher mileage vehicles. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter damage, and potentially engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from replacing valve seals to a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lifter Tick (AFM Related)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise coming from the engine, particularly when cold. Often related to the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system and its lifters collapsing. This affects 2007 Trailblazers equipped with the 5.3L V8 and AFM.
    *   Solution: Disable AFM via tuning or replace the AFM lifters with standard lifters and remove/disable AFM components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E (Both Engines)**

*   **Slipping and Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, or failure to shift. Often caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or solenoid failure.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can also cause poor fuel economy and transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sags, compressor runs constantly or doesn't run at all, "Service Ride Control" message appears.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor and inspect for leaks in the air lines or air springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noise from the front suspension, loose or wandering steering.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges stop working, flicker, or display incorrect readings. Common problem is faulty stepper motors in the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replace the stepper motors or replace the entire instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks fail to operate, either not locking or unlocking.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (per door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the lower body panels, particularly around the rocker panels and rear wheel wells. Common in areas with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, body panel replacement, and painting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blower motor only works on certain speeds or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof jams, doesn't open or close properly, or makes excessive noise.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer can be a comfortable and capable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems like camshaft actuator failure (4.2L) and oil consumption/AFM issues (5.3L) can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4L60E, are also a significant concern. Other issues such as electrical problems and suspension wear should be inspected carefully. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
