The 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer marked the start of a new era for GM's mid-size SUV, offering a blend of truck-like capability and car-like comfort. The most common engine was the 4.2L Vortec inline-six, producing 270 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. The 5.3L V8 was an optional upgrade and produced 290 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Trailblazer's spacious interior, smooth ride, and powerful engines. Criticisms often focused on fuel economy, some reliability issues, and the relatively plain interior design.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer can be a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems, particularly ignition coil failure and camshaft actuator issues on the 4.2L and oil consumption issues on the 5.3L, are fairly common. Transmission slipping and harsh shifting are also potential concerns. Suspension and electrical issues, such as air suspension compressor failure (if equipped) and instrument cluster problems, can add to the ownership costs. Rust on the rocker panels and rear quarter panels is a major concern, especially in regions with road salt. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major repairs like transmission rebuilds or engine work. Careful inspection and maintenance are key to prolonging the life of a 2002 Trailblazer.
