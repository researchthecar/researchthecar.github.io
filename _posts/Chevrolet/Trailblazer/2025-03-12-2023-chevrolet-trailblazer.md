The 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a subcompact SUV offering a stylish design and affordable price point. Engine options include a 1.2-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 137 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 155 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque.
