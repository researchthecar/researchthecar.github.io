### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer presents a mixed reliability profile. The inline-six engine is generally robust, but the V8 engines, particularly those with Active Fuel Management (AFM), are prone to costly lifter failures. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60-E, can also arise. Common suspension problems include wheel bearings and ball joints. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or ignition switch, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are generally solid, HVAC blend door actuators can fail. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect any 2006 Trailblazer, paying close attention to the specific engine and transmission, and be prepared for potential repairs, especially on higher-mileage examples.
