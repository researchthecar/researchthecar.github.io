### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a capable SUV with some common issues to be aware of. The inline-six engine is generally robust, but the V8 can suffer from AFM-related problems. Transmission issues, particularly with the 3-4 clutch pack and torque converter, are not uncommon. Suspension components like wheel bearings and ball joints require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or HVAC controls, can be frustrating. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior dashboard cracking can occur. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Trailblazers have provided reliable service with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
