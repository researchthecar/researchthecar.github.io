The 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a subcompact SUV that offers a blend of style, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It came with two engine options: a 1.2L Turbocharged I3 producing 137 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque and a 1.3L Turbocharged I3 producing 155 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. The 1.2L engine is paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), while the 1.3L engine comes standard with the CVT on front-wheel-drive models and a 9-speed automatic transmission on all-wheel-drive models. Owners often praise the Trailblazer's modern design, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. However, some common criticisms include the small cargo space, and somewhat underpowered base engine.

**Engine**

**1.2L Turbocharged I3**

* **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation upon acceleration, particularly from a stop. In some cases, this can lead to stalling. The issue seems to be more prevalent in colder climates.
    * Solution: The exact cause is still being investigated, but possible solutions include software updates to the engine control module (ECM), fuel injector cleaning, or replacement of faulty sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis can range from $100-$200. If a sensor is faulty, the replacement can be around $200+. A software update is usually less expensive.
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.3L Turbocharged I3**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that their 1.3L engines are consuming more oil than expected, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: The cause of the oil consumption is not definitively known, but potential solutions being explored by dealerships and owners include replacing the PCV valve, performing an engine flush to remove potential sludge buildup, and, in more severe cases, replacing piston rings or the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: PCV valve replacement: $100 - $200. More extensive repairs like piston ring replacement or engine replacement can cost several thousands of dollars.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) (Paired with Both Engine Options)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting or jerking sensations during acceleration or deceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Potential solutions include transmission fluid flush and replacement, software updates to the transmission control module (TCM), or, in severe cases, replacement of the CVT unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission fluid flush: $150 - $300. CVT replacement: $4,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 1.3L Turbocharged I3 on AWD Models)**

* **Delayed/Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported delayed or rough shifting between gears, particularly during upshifts. This can be accompanied by a clunking or thumping sound.
    * Solution: Potential causes include low transmission fluid level, faulty solenoids in the valve body, or a malfunctioning torque converter. Solutions may involve checking and topping off the transmission fluid, replacing faulty solenoids, or replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Adding Transmission Fluid: $20-$50. Replacing the solenoids: $500 - $1000. Torque Converter replacement: $1500 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported the infotainment system freezing, crashing, or becoming unresponsive. This can affect access to navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    * Solution: Potential solutions include software updates to the infotainment system, a hard reset of the system, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: Often free at the dealership. Infotainment unit replacement: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle. This can be caused by a parasitic draw on the battery.
    * Solution: The solution involves identifying the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component. This may require a professional diagnostic.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis: $100 - $200. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the source of the draw. Battery replacement: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Faulty Door Handle**
    * Description/Symptoms: The door handles are prone to sticking or breaking
    * Solution: Replacement of door handle assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling or squeaking noises emanating from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    * Solution: The solution depends on the source of the noise and may involve tightening loose screws, applying lubricant to contact points, or replacing worn-out components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the source and complexity of the repair. Could range from a simple DIY fix to a professional repair costing several hundred dollars.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While some problems, like infotainment system glitches and minor interior rattles, are relatively minor inconveniences, others, such as excessive oil consumption and transmission problems, can be more severe and costly to repair. The frequency of these issues appears to be relatively low, but prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for these problems to arise. The average cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements like the engine or transmission. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic are recommended before purchasing a used 2022 Trailblazer.
