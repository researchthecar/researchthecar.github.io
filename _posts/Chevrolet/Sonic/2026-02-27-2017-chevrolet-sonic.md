### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Chevrolet Sonic presents a generally reliable profile for its segment, with the most commonly reported issues revolving around the powertrain and suspension. Both the 1.8L and 1.4L turbo engines can experience oil or coolant leaks, and the turbo variant is more susceptible to turbocharger problems and oil consumption. Automatic transmissions may develop issues with harsh shifting or leaks. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear over time, leading to ride quality degradation and noise. Electrical concerns are less frequent but can include alternator failure or infotainment system glitches. Overall, addressing potential leaks and ensuring proper transmission maintenance are key to long-term reliability.
