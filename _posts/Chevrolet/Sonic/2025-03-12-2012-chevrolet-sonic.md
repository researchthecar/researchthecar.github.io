The 2012 Chevrolet Sonic was General Motors' entry into the subcompact car market, offering a blend of practicality and fuel efficiency. It was available as both a sedan and a hatchback. Two engine options were offered: a 1.8L naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a more popular 1.4L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic for the 1.8L engine, and a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic for the 1.4L turbo. Owners often appreciated the Sonic's nimble handling, relatively spacious interior for its class, and distinctive styling, especially in hatchback form. Common dislikes include a sometimes-harsh ride, the 1.8L engine being underpowered, and some reliability concerns.
