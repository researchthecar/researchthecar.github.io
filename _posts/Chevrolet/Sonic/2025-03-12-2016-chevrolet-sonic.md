The 2016 Chevrolet Sonic is a subcompact car that was available as a sedan or hatchback. Engine options included a 1.8L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 138 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque and a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 producing 138 hp and 148 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual (1.8L only), a 6-speed manual (1.4L Turbo only), and a 6-speed automatic, available with either engine. Owners generally appreciate the Sonic's fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and available technology features. Common complaints revolve around the car's relatively small size, road noise, and some reported reliability issues, particularly with certain engine and transmission configurations.

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Sonic, while appreciated for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, does present some reliability concerns. The 1.4L turbo engine faces potential turbocharger and PCV valve issues, while the 1.8L may encounter intake manifold problems. Transmission problems, especially with the 6-speed automatic, can lead to costly repairs. Electrical and suspension issues are also present, albeit less frequently. Repair costs can range from relatively minor expenses (e.g., ignition coils) to substantial investments (e.g., transmission replacement), making it crucial for prospective buyers to have a pre-purchase inspection performed.
