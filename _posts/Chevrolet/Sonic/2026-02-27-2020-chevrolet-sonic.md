### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Chevrolet Sonic is a budget-friendly option that, while generally reliable for its class, has some documented weaknesses. The 1.4L turbocharged engine can experience turbocharger issues and coolant leaks. The automatic transmission is more prone to problems like harsh shifting or slipping compared to the manual. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted. The suspension, exterior, and interior components appear to be relatively robust with no widespread critical failures reported. Prospective buyers should be aware of potential powertrain and electrical concerns and factor in maintenance costs.
