### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Chevrolet Sonic presents a mixed reliability profile. The 1.4L turbocharged engine is more prone to issues like turbocharger failure and oil leaks compared to the 1.8L. Automatic transmissions have seen reports of harsh shifting, suggesting potential internal wear or control issues. Suspension components, particularly struts and shocks, can require replacement as the vehicle ages. Electrical gremlins, such as alternator failures and infotainment system glitches, are also noted. While the exterior and manual transmission generally fare better, potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas and factor in potential repair costs, especially for the turbocharged engine and automatic gearbox.
