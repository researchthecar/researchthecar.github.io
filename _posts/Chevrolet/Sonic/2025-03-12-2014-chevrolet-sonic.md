The 2014 Chevrolet Sonic is a subcompact car that offered two engine options: a 1.8L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, although the 1.4L turbo was only available with a 6-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the Sonic's nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and available features for its class. Common dislikes include a somewhat cramped rear seat and occasional reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, loss of power, check engine light. May be due to oil starvation caused by a clogged oil supply line.
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger and inspect the oil supply line for blockages. Consider replacing the oil supply line.

* **PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, check engine light, oil leaks, whistling noise from the engine. Can be caused by a cracked or damaged PCV valve or hose.
    * Solution: Replace the PCV valve and/or any damaged hoses.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Low coolant level, overheating, sweet smell of coolant, visible leaks near the water pump, thermostat housing, or coolant hoses.
    * Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. This may involve replacing the water pump, thermostat housing, coolant hoses, or radiator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the source of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnostics are needed, and the valve body may need replacement, or the transmission rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $100-$200, Valve body replacement $500-$1200+, Transmission rebuild/replacement $2000-$4000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.  Worn strut mounts can cause excessive noise and vibration.

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Sonic has a mix of common issues, with engine and transmission problems being the most prevalent and potentially costly. The 1.4L turbo engine is prone to turbocharger and PCV system failures, while the 1.8L engine can suffer from coolant outlet and intake manifold issues. Both engines paired with the 6-speed automatic can have issues with shifting. Suspension and electrical problems are also reported. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor repairs like replacing a PCV valve to more significant expenses like replacing a turbocharger or transmission. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing a used 2014 Chevrolet Sonic.
