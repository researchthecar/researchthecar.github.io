**Introduction**

The 2012 Chevrolet Sonic is a subcompact car available in sedan and hatchback body styles. It offers a choice of two engines: a 1.8L inline-4 producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque and a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 generating 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission.

The Sonic has received praise for its agile handling, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior for its size. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of power and uncomfortable ride.
