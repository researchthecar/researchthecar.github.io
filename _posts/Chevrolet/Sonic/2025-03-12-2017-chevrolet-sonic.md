The 2017 Chevrolet Sonic is a subcompact car offered in both sedan and hatchback configurations. It was available with two engine options: a 1.8L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual (1.8L only), a 6-speed manual (1.4L only), or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sonic for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some common complaints include a somewhat cramped rear seat, a less refined interior compared to some competitors, and occasional reports of reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Sonic can be a fuel-efficient and practical small car, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 1.4L turbo (turbo failure, intake manifold) and 1.8L (oil consumption), and transmission issues are potential concerns. Suspension and electrical issues also appear with some frequency. Repair costs can range from relatively minor (sensor replacement) to quite significant (engine or transmission rebuild), making a thorough pre-purchase inspection highly recommended.
