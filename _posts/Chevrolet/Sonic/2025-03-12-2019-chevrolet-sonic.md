The 2019 Chevrolet Sonic is a subcompact car that offers a good balance of fuel efficiency and features for its price point. It comes with a 1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4 engine producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Sonic is often praised for its nimble handling, user-friendly infotainment system, and available features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. However, it is sometimes criticized for its relatively small rear seat and cargo space compared to some competitors, and some owners have reported issues with reliability.
