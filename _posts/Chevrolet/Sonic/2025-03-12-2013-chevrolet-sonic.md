The 2013 Chevrolet Sonic is a subcompact car that was offered in both sedan and hatchback body styles. The Sonic was known for its relatively sporty handling, decent fuel economy, and available tech features for its class. Some owners appreciated its youthful styling and maneuverability in urban environments, while others found the interior materials to be cheap and the ride quality to be somewhat harsh. The 2013 Sonic had two engine options: a 1.8L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic for the 1.8L, and a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic for the 1.4L turbo.
