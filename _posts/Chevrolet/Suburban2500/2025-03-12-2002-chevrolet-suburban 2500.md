Engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque, and the 8.1L Vortec V8 producing 340 horsepower and 455 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are the 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Suburban 2500 for its ability to haul large families and cargo, as well as its ruggedness. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, the age of the vehicle leading to general wear and tear, and specific mechanical issues that are typical of vehicles from this era.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, rough running engine, loss of coolant, possible overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knock Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy. Often caused by moisture intrusion due to the sensor's location under the intake manifold.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the knock sensors (typically both are replaced at the same time) and potentially addressing the source of moisture intrusion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leak noise (ticking or hissing), reduced fuel economy, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of broken exhaust manifold bolts. This can be a difficult job if bolts are seized or break off flush with the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ (depending on severity and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes, blueish smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause (e.g., valve stem seals, piston rings). Repair or replacement of the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the cause and extent of repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, transmission slipping out of gear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause (e.g., worn clutches, faulty solenoids, valve body issues). Repair or replacement of the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3000+ (depending on the cause and extent of repair, rebuild vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially when accelerating, stalling, or transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Torsion Bar Sag/Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting lower than normal, uneven ride height, poor ride quality.
    *   Solution: Adjusting or replacing torsion bars.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on whether adjustment is sufficient or replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sag/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of vehicle sitting lower than normal, poor ride quality, potential for broken leaves.
