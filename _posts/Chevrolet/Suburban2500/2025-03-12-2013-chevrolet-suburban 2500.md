The 2013 Chevrolet Suburban 2500 is a heavy-duty, full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capability, and comfortable ride. It was offered with two engine options: a 6.0L Vortec V8 (LY6) producing 352 hp and 382 lb-ft of torque and a 6.0L Vortec V8 L96 producing 366 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the 6L90 six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Suburban 2500 for its ability to haul large families and cargo, as well as its robustness and durability. Common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, difficulty parking in tight spaces, and higher maintenance costs associated with a heavy-duty vehicle.
