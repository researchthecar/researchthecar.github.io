The 2011 Chevrolet Suburban 2500 is a heavy-duty, full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 352 horsepower and 382 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 322 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6L90E six-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Suburban's ability to haul large families and cargo while providing a smooth ride. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, the large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and some reported mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (352 hp / 382 lb-ft)**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, and potential engine damage. This is due to the AFM lifters collapsing and failing to function properly, leading to the cylinder deactivation system malfunctioning.
    * Solution: Replace all AFM lifters with updated or non-AFM lifters, and potentially replace the camshaft if damaged. Some owners also disable the AFM system through reprogramming.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs. Often linked to the AFM system and potential ring issues. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Install a catch can system to filter oil mist from the PCV system, or address the issue via piston ring replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500 (catch can), $3,000 - $5,000+ (piston ring replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Chevrolet Suburban 2500 presents owners with a range of potential issues. The most serious and costly are related to the engine, specifically AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption, both potentially requiring extensive repairs. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter failure, can also be expensive. Suspension and electrical problems are less severe in terms of cost but can still be frustrating. Rust is a common concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. While the Suburban offers practicality and capability, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs.
