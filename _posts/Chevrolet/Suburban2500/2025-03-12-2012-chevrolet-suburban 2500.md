**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and potential engine damage due to collapsed lifters. Often accompanied by a check engine light and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, often recommending replacement of all AFM lifters as a preventative measure. Installation of a non-AFM camshaft and lifters to eliminate the AFM system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Often attributed to piston ring issues or valve guide seals.
    *   Solution: Replacing piston rings and/or valve guide seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knock Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine will experience a loss of power because it is pulling timing to protect the engine from the false detection of knock. Check engine light will be present.
    *   Solution: Replace knock sensors and inspect/replace the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L90E Six-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Can also manifest as erratic shifting or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. Full transmission rebuild may be necessary if the failure caused internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abnormally rough or jerky shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be needed, potentially involving valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Autoride Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the air compressor, air shocks leaking, or sensors malfunctioning. This can result in a sagging rear suspension, a rough ride, or the "Service Ride Control" message appearing on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air compressor, air shocks, or sensors. Many owners opt to replace the Autoride system with conventional shocks and springs as a more reliable and cost-effective alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the parts needing replacement and if converting to a standard suspension)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of ball joints, tie rod ends, and idler arms due to the vehicle's weight and usage. Symptoms include loose steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn components. Regularly lubricating these parts can help extend their lifespan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ (depending on the number of components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Cluster (IPC) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning or failing to work, flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument panel cluster. Some repair shops specialize in rebuilding these clusters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks failing to lock or unlock, or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Rocker Panels, Wheel Wells)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair and prevention. Replacement of rusted panels may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
