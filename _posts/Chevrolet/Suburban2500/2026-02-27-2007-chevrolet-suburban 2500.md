### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Suburban 2500 is a capable heavy-duty vehicle, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 6.0L V8 engine can experience intake manifold leaks and AFM-related lifter problems, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter shudder and overheating, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and shocks may require attention over time. Electrical concerns, such as BCM glitches and alternator failures, can lead to frustrating and varied symptoms. Rust can be a significant concern on the exterior, especially on the frame. Interiorly, HVAC blend door actuators and instrument cluster gauges are known failure points. Despite these potential issues, many Suburban 2500s remain reliable workhorses when properly maintained and repaired.
