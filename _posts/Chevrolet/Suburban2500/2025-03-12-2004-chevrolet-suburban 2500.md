The 2004 Chevrolet Suburban 2500 is a heavy-duty, full-size SUV known for its towing capacity and spaciousness. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (rated around 300 hp and 360 lb-ft of torque) and the 8.1L Vortec V8 (rated around 325 hp and 447 lb-ft of torque). Both were paired with the 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Suburban 2500 for its ability to haul large families and tow heavy loads. Common dislikes include its fuel economy, large size making it difficult to park and maneuver, and age-related wear and tear on components.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms can include blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve stem seals can sometimes mitigate the issue. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Knock Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced performance, poor fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating. Error codes related to the knock sensors will be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the knock sensors, which are located under the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or hissing sound, especially on cold starts, emanating from the exhaust manifold area. This can lead to exhaust leaks and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts, often a difficult task due to corrosion and potential for further breakage. Sometimes requires manifold removal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the severity and shop labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L80E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, or the transmission slipping out of gear. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might improve the issue. However, worn clutches or valve body issues often require a rebuild or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a fluid flush and filter change; $2,000 - $4,000+ for a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, especially during acceleration, or stalling at low speeds. May also trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, often done in conjunction with a transmission service.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, clunking noises over bumps, and uneven tire wear. Common culprits include ball joints, tie rod ends, and idler arms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn components. It's generally recommended to replace these in pairs (e.g., both ball joints on one axle).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component pair, depending on the part and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sitting lower than the front, especially when loaded. This can affect handling and ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with new ones or adding helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ for leaf spring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.) malfunctioning or becoming inaccurate. Sometimes the entire cluster will fail.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the instrument cluster. Refurbished units are often a more cost-effective option than new ones.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on new vs. refurbished and shop labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor (for the AC and heat) only works on certain speeds, or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower body panels, particularly around the rocker panels and wheel wells. This is common in areas with road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair by cutting out the damaged metal and welding in new panels, followed by bodywork and painting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the rust and the quality of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks forming on the dashboard, especially in sun-exposed areas.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ for a dashboard cover; $1000 - $2000+ for dashboard replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks not working properly, either failing to lock/unlock or making unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door, depending on labor rates.
