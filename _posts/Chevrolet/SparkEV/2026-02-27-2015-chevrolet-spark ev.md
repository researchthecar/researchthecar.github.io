### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Chevrolet Spark EV demonstrates good reliability, particularly in its core electric powertrain and transmission, which are simpler than their internal combustion counterparts. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the high-voltage battery pack, where degradation and reduced range can occur over time, and the charging system, which may develop port or connectivity issues. Infotainment system glitches are also noted, though often resolvable with software updates. Overall, for an electric vehicle of its era, the Spark EV is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the battery's lifespan and the possibility of electrical component repairs, especially outside of warranty.
