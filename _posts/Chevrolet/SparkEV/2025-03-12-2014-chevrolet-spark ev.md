The 2014 Chevrolet Spark EV is an all-electric subcompact hatchback. It was only offered with a single electric motor and single-speed direct drive transmission. The electric motor produced 140 horsepower and 327 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praised the Spark EV for its quick acceleration, nimble handling, and affordability as an electric vehicle. However, the limited range (around 82 miles) and small size were common drawbacks.
