The 2015 Chevrolet Spark EV is a subcompact electric vehicle designed for city driving. It stands out for its affordability and surprising pep, delivering an estimated 140 horsepower and 327 lb-ft of torque from its electric motor, making it quicker off the line than its gasoline-powered counterpart. The Spark EV features a single-speed direct drive transmission. Owners appreciate its nimble handling, compact size for easy parking, and of course, the benefits of electric vehicle ownership like low running costs and zero tailpipe emissions. However, downsides often mentioned include the limited range, which can be a concern for longer trips, and the relatively basic interior compared to some competitors.

**Electric Motor**

* **Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced driving range over time. The battery's capacity diminishes, resulting in fewer miles per charge than when the vehicle was new.
    * Solution: Battery replacement or, in some cases, individual cell replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+ (for full battery replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Description/Symptoms: Inability to charge using either Level 1 (120V) or Level 2 (240V) chargers. The car may display error messages or simply fail to initiate the charging process.
    * Solution: Diagnose the onboard charger, charging port, or related wiring harness. Replacement of faulty components may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the failed component)
    * Recalls: None Found
* **"Service High Voltage Charging System" Error**
    * Description/Symptoms: Displaying the error message on the dashboard, often accompanied by a reduction in power or complete charging failure. This is often caused by a malfunctioning battery management system (BMS) or related components.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair the high voltage system. This may involve replacing the BMS, individual battery cells, or related sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the specific cause and parts needed)

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Spark EV offers an affordable entry point into electric vehicle ownership, but like any car, it has potential issues. The most serious concerns relate to battery degradation and high-voltage charging system problems, which can be expensive to fix. Other issues, such as the charge port door and infotainment system glitches, are generally less severe and more affordable to address. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the battery's health and charging functionality before purchasing a used Spark EV.
