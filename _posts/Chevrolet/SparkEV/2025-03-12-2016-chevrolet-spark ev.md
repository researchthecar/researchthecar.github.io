The 2016 Chevrolet Spark EV is a subcompact electric vehicle designed for city driving. It's powered by a 140 horsepower electric motor producing 327 lb-ft of torque, paired with a single-speed direct drive transmission. It was only offered with the electric motor and single-speed transmission. Owners often praise its nimble handling, quick acceleration (especially in low-speed city environments), and efficient electric range. Criticisms typically revolve around its small size (limiting passenger and cargo space), limited range compared to newer EVs, and some concerns about battery degradation over time.
