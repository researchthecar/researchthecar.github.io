The 2002 Chevrolet Corvette is a performance icon known for its sleek design, powerful engine, and engaging driving experience. Available as a coupe, convertible, and the higher-performance Z06, the 2002 Corvette offered drivers a blend of style and performance. Most models came equipped with a 5.7L LS1 V8 engine producing 350 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque, while the Z06 variant boasted an upgraded LS6 engine with 405 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission were the transmission options. Owners often praise the Corvette's acceleration, handling, and distinctive look, while some common complaints include the low ground clearance, interior quality issues, and potential for expensive repairs due to its performance-oriented nature.
