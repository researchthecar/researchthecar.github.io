Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2016 Chevrolet Corvette, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2016 Chevrolet Corvette is a performance-oriented sports car, known for its powerful engine, sharp handling, and aggressive styling. The 2016 Corvette offered several engine options including the 6.2L LT1 V8 (455 hp, 460 lb-ft torque), the 6.2L Supercharged LT4 V8 (650 hp, 650 lb-ft torque) found in the Z06, and two transmission choices: a 7-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the Corvette's performance, value, and distinctive looks. Common dislikes include some interior material quality concerns and ride harshness, particularly with the Z06 model.

**Engine**

**6.2L LT1 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, and potential for significant engine damage. AFM lifters collapse and cause the valves to not open or close properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of all AFM lifters with updated versions or conversion to non-AFM lifters. Some owners choose to replace the camshaft as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. The engine may smoke, especially during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Could involve replacing valve seals, piston rings, or even a short block replacement, depending on the severity. A compression test and leak-down test are recommended to diagnose the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (highly variable)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L Supercharged LT4 V8 (Z06)**

*   **Overheating Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Z06 model, especially when driven hard or in warmer climates, is prone to overheating. This can lead to reduced engine performance (due to thermal management systems reducing power) and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Installation of larger radiators, improved cooling fans, and aftermarket cooling solutions. Some owners also modify the hood vents for better airflow.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Belt Slip**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost, whining noise from the supercharger, and reduced acceleration. High heat and wear can cause the supercharger belt to slip, especially under hard acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger belt with a higher quality, reinforced belt. Upgrading the pulley system to reduce belt slip is also a common modification.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough shifting, clunking noises, and shuddering, particularly at low speeds or during light acceleration. Many owners report this issue as a common complaint.
    *   Solution: Multiple TSBs exist for fluid flush procedure using Mobil Delvac Full Synthetic ATF ULV. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, especially under light load. This can feel like driving over rumble strips.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride height, clunking noises, and reduced handling performance. The magnetic ride control shocks can fail due to leaks or internal component failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected MRC shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery after short periods of inactivity. The Corvette has several electronic systems that can drain the battery even when the car is off.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the parasitic draw and repairing the faulty component. Could involve a faulty module, a malfunctioning sensor, or a short in the wiring. Battery replacement may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, unresponsive touch screen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates, infotainment system reset, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Issues (Convertible Models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure to operate, sticking points during operation, and water leaks. The convertible top mechanism can be complex and prone to issues.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the faulty components in the convertible top mechanism. Adjustments to the alignment of the top may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Cooling Fan Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cooled seats stop working or produce weak airflow. The fans can fail due to debris buildup or motor failure.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the seat cooling fan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Corvette presents a mix of performance and potential issues. Engine problems, especially related to AFM lifters and oil consumption in the LT1, and overheating in the LT4, can be expensive to address. Transmission issues with the 8L90 automatic are also a common concern. Suspension and electrical issues add to the overall potential maintenance costs. While the Corvette offers excellent value and performance, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. The severity of issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars.
