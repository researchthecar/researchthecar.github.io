The 2008 Chevrolet Corvette is a sports car that blends performance with relative affordability. The base engine is the 6.2L LS3 V8, producing 430 hp and 424 lb-ft of torque, or 436 hp and 428 lb-ft with the optional NPP exhaust. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard, and a 6-speed automatic is optional. The Corvette is praised for its powerful engine, sporty handling, and comfortable interior (for a sports car), but some owners have complained about electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain. Some people dislike the cheap interior materials used, and the run-flat tires contribute to a harsh ride.
