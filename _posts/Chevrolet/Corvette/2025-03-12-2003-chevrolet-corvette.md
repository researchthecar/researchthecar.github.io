The 2003 Chevrolet Corvette is a performance car praised for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and sporty handling. It offered two engine options: the standard 5.7L LS1 V8 producing 350 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque, and the optional 5.7L LS6 V8 (Z06) producing 405 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 6-speed manual transmission, while the LS1 could also be paired with a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Corvette's performance and value, but some common complaints include electrical issues, specifically with the column lock system, and the potential for oil consumption in the LS1 engine.

**Engine**

**5.7L LS1 V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some LS1 engines, including those in the 2003 Corvette, have been reported to consume excessive amounts of oil. Symptoms include low oil level, the need to frequently add oil between changes, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Addressing oil consumption can involve various approaches, starting with checking for leaks and verifying the PCV system is functioning correctly. If these checks don't resolve the issue, more invasive solutions like replacing valve stem seals or piston rings may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+

**5.7L LS6 V8**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L60E) (Only available with LS1)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4L60E can experience issues such as hard shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or solenoid failure.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution can range from a fluid change and filter replacement to a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+

**6-Speed Manual (MM6)**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the composite rear leaf spring can sag, leading to reduced ride height and potentially affecting handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf spring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800

**Electrical**

*   **Column Lock System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The column lock system is a common source of problems. Symptoms include the "Pull Key Wait 10 Seconds" message appearing on the DIC, difficulty starting the car, and/or the steering wheel locking up unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with installing a column lock bypass module. Alternatively, replacing the column lock motor or the entire steering column assembly might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+

*   **Instrument Panel Dimming or Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The instrument panel can experience dimming issues or outright failure, making it difficult to read gauges and other information.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster. Sometimes, the issue can be traced to a faulty ground connection.
