The 2007 Chevrolet Corvette is a sports car known for its performance and iconic styling. It's offered with two engine options: the base 6.0L LS2 V8 producing 400 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, and the optional 7.0L LS7 V8 found in the Z06 model, which cranks out 505 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Corvette's powerful engines, sharp handling, and relatively affordable price point for the performance it offers. Some common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior materials and occasional reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Corvette, while an excellent performance car, can suffer from several notable issues. Some of the most serious, such as the LS7 valve guide wear and column lock issues, can be costly to repair. Other problems, like the valve spring failures on the LS2 or the clutch failure with the manual transmission, are more standard maintenance items but still require attention. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and budget accordingly, or seek out a car where these problems have already been addressed. The severity of these problems range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the associated costs reflect that range.
