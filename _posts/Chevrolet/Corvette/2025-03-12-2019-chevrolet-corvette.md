The 2019 Chevrolet Corvette is a sports car praised for its performance, styling, and relative affordability. The base engine is a naturally aspirated 6.2L LT1 V8 producing 455 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, or 460 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque with the performance exhaust. The Z06 model boasts a supercharged 6.2L LT4 V8 delivering 650 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. The ZR1 cranks things up even further with a supercharged 6.2L LT5 V8 making 755 horsepower and 715 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 7-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Corvette's exhilarating acceleration, responsive handling, and comfortable ride (especially with the Magnetic Ride Control). Some common dislikes include the interior materials, which some consider subpar for the price point, and occasional electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**6.2L LT1 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM), also known as cylinder deactivation, system can experience lifter failure. Symptoms include misfires, rough running engine, and potentially catastrophic engine damage if left unaddressed. This is a common issue in many GM vehicles with AFM.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, potentially the camshaft, and performing necessary engine repairs. AFM can be disabled through aftermarket tuning or by replacing the AFM lifters with standard lifters to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L LT4 Supercharged V8**

* **Supercharger Intercooler Brick Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking or leaking in the intercooler bricks inside the supercharger. Symptoms can include loss of coolant, reduced power, and potentially engine damage if coolant enters the combustion chamber.
    * Solution: Replacing the intercooler bricks. Some aftermarket options offer upgraded durability.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the shop and replacement parts used.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.2L LT5 Supercharged V8**

* **Supercharger Belt Slippage**
    * Description/Symptoms: High-performance ZR1 models can experience supercharger belt slippage, particularly under hard acceleration. This results in a noticeable power loss and can lead to belt damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the supercharger belt with a higher quality belt, upgrading the supercharger pulley to a smaller size, or upgrading to a higher capacity supercharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the selected modifications.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8L90 transmission can exhibit harsh shifting, particularly during low-speed operation and between gears. Some owners also report hesitation when accelerating. A known issue is valve body issues and torque converter shudder.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush with a revised Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid (blue label) may help in some cases. Valve body replacement or torque converter replacement can also resolve the issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) to $2,000 - $5,000+ (valve body or torque converter replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Magnetic Ride Control shocks can leak fluid or fail outright, leading to a degraded ride quality, uneven handling, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected Magnetic Ride Control shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the number of shocks replaced and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, including freezing, slow response times, and connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer can often resolve these issues. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,000+ (infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with excessive battery drain, particularly when the vehicle is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the parasitic drain by diagnosing the electrical system. Disconnecting the battery when the car will be stored may prevent this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Targa Top Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The removable targa top on coupe models can sometimes experience alignment issues, leading to wind noise and water leaks.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the targa top alignment or replacing weather stripping.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Cooling Fan Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat cooling fans can fail, resulting in reduced or no cooling to the seats.
    *   Solution: Replacing the seat cooling fan(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per seat depending on the location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Corvette offers exhilarating performance but, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine (AFM lifter failure, supercharger intercooler bricks, belt slippage) and transmission (harsh shifting/hesitation). These issues can be costly to repair and can impact the long-term reliability of the vehicle. Electrical glitches and suspension problems (Magnetic Ride Control) are also reported. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any used Corvette before purchase, paying particular attention to the maintenance history and signs of potential problems.
