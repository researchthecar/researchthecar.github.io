**Engine**

**6.2L LT1 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifter failure can occur, leading to misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. A ticking or knocking sound from the engine bay is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder heads. In severe cases, camshaft replacement may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L LT4 V8**

*   **Supercharger Intercooler Brick Cracking/Coolant Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the supercharger intercooler bricks leads to coolant leaking into the engine. This can cause a loss of power, misfires, and potential engine damage. White smoke from the exhaust may also be observed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the supercharger intercooler brick(s). Some owners also replace the supercharger itself as a preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8L90 transmission is known for experiencing harsh shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, and hesitation when accelerating. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A triple flush with Mobil 1 LV ATF HP transmission fluid as per TSB 18-NA-355, or valve body replacement may be required. Some owners have also had success with a transmission tune or replacement.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Damper Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the MRC dampers, leading to reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, and potential handling issues. Fluid leaks may be visible on the dampers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed MRC damper(s). Replacement of all four dampers may be recommended for optimal performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the number of dampers replaced)

    *   Description/Symptoms: The Corvette can experience parasitic battery drain, leading to a dead battery, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and addressing the faulty component or circuit. This may involve checking for aftermarket accessories, faulty modules, or wiring issues. Some owners use battery tenders when the vehicle is stored.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, and Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the system, or replacing the infotainment unit.
