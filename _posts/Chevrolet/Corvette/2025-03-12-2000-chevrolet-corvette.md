The 2000 Chevrolet Corvette C5 is a sports car that offers a blend of performance and comfort. The standard engine was the 5.7L LS1 V8, producing 345 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. A popular performance upgrade was the Z51 suspension package. People generally appreciate the Corvette's powerful engine, agile handling, and stylish design. Downsides often include a somewhat dated interior and occasional build quality issues. A 6-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission were the available transmission options.

**Engine**

**5.7L LS1 V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be due to worn piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings and/or valve seals. In severe cases, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car may stall intermittently, have difficulty starting, or exhibit rough idling. A check engine light may illuminate with a code related to the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

* **Valve Spring Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: This issue is more prevalent in modified engines or engines that have been run hard for extended periods. Broken valve springs can lead to misfires, reduced power, and potentially catastrophic engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve springs. It is recommended to replace all valve springs at the same time to prevent future failures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Hard Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip between gears, especially when cold, or shift harshly. Delayed engagement is also a symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn clutch packs, valve body rebuild, or complete transmission overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The composite leaf springs, particularly the rear one, can sag over time, leading to a loss of ride height and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A humming or grinding noise that increases with vehicle speed. Play in the wheel when checking.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected wheel bearing(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Column Lock Issue**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The steering column may lock up, preventing the car from starting. The "Service Column Lock" message may appear on the DIC (Driver Information Center). This is a known issue with the early C5 Corvettes.
    *   Solution: Bypass the column lock system, replace the column lock motor, or perform a software reflash (if available and applicable).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: **Recall Number: 04V583000**
DESCRIPTION:ON CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES, THE ELECTRONIC COLUMN LOCK (ECL) SYSTEM MAY BECOME INOPERATIVE.
CONSEQUENCE:WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED, THE STEERING COLUMN MAY NOT LOCK. IN THIS EVENT, THE VEHICLE DOES NOT CONFORM TO FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARD (FMVSS) NO. 114, "THEFT PROTECTION." IF THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION, THE VEHICLE COULD LOSE STEERING CONTROL INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.
REMEDY:DEALERS WILL REPROGRAM THE SOFTWARE TO THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE (PCM) AND STEERING COLUMN LOCK MODULE. OWNER NOTIFICATION BEGAN NOVEMBER 29, 2004. OWNERS SHOULD CONTACT CHEVROLET AT 1-800-222-1020.

*   **Dimming Instrument Panel Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument panel lights may dim or flicker intermittently.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the dimmer switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Motor Gear Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights may not open or close properly, often accompanied by a grinding noise from the headlight motor. The plastic gears inside the headlight motor are prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight motor gear with a metal one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per headlight

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises from behind the dashboard, inconsistent temperature control, or inability to direct airflow to certain vents.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty HVAC actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per actuator

**Summary**

The 2000 Chevrolet Corvette is generally a reliable sports car, but like any vehicle of its age, it has some common issues. The most prevalent problems relate to the engine (oil consumption), transmission (slipping), suspension (leaf spring sag and wheel bearing failure), and electrical systems (column lock and dimming lights). The severity and cost of repairs vary, with engine and transmission work being the most expensive. Many of the issues are age-related, so preventative maintenance and careful inspection are crucial for prospective buyers.
