The 2006 Chevrolet Corvette is a performance-oriented sports car that marked the second year of the sixth generation (C6). This model year is praised for its blend of power, handling, and relative affordability. It features a more refined interior compared to previous generations, and its sleek design is widely appreciated. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Engine options include the standard 6.0L LS2 V8 and later in the year the 7.0L LS7. The LS2 produces 400 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Some common dislikes include the interior materials (hard plastics), and some electronic quirks. Some of the most liked things about the car include the LS engine and the vehicle's ability to perform well, while being a relatively reliable vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Corvette, while a desirable sports car, does suffer from some common issues. Engine issues, particularly valve-related problems on both the LS2 and LS7 engines, can be expensive to address. Electrical glitches, such as the column lock and DIC failures, can also be frustrating. Suspension and transmission problems are less frequent but should still be considered. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in the potential costs of repairs when considering purchasing a 2006 Corvette. The severity and cost of these issues can range from relatively minor fixes to major engine overhauls, so a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
