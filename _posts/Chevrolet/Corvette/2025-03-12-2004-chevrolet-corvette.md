The 2004 Chevrolet Corvette, a C5 generation model, is known for its performance and relatively affordable price point compared to other sports cars. The base engine is the 5.7L LS1 V8, producing 350 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. The Z06 model came with a higher output LS6, producing 405 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque.
