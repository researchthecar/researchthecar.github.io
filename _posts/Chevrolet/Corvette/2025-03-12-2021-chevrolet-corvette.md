The 2021 Chevrolet Corvette C8 is a mid-engine sports car praised for its performance, handling, and striking design. The base engine is a 6.2L LT2 V8 producing 490 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque (or 495 horsepower and 470 lb-ft with the optional performance exhaust). An 8-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) is standard. Many owners love the Corvette's blend of supercar looks and performance at a comparatively affordable price point. Some common complaints revolve around the interior quality not matching the high price tag, limited storage space, and certain electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**6.2L LT2 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, check engine light activation. AFM lifters fail, often causing damage to the camshaft. Can be particularly prevalent on vehicles that have seen track use, although is not limited to only those models.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters and camshaft, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) M1L Tremec**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly at low speeds. Hesitation during acceleration, especially when downshifting.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration of the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may help in some cases, but physical repairs will be required for others. Some have needed new valve bodies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 for software calibration, $1,500 - $3,000+ for physical repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Mag Ride Suspension (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks, reduced ride quality, error messages on the dashboard. The electronic dampening is lost on the affected strut.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected magnetic ride strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500 per strut.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car is dead when trying to start it, especially after it has been sitting for a few days. Can be caused by a faulty Body Control Module (BCM) or other modules not properly shutting down.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the parasitic drain. Replacement of the BCM or faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for diagnosis, $500 - $1,500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, crashing, or rebooting of the infotainment system. Issues with the touchscreen or connectivity features.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the infotainment system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates, $500 - $1,500+ for system replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Targa Top Alignment/Sealing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Wind noise or water leaks around the targa top. Difficult to properly align or secure the top.
    *   Solution: Adjustment of the targa top latches and seals. Replacement of weather stripping.

    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **HVAC Issues (specifically Blend Door)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air is not being distributed where it is supposed to go, such as the vents or the defroster.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the blend door actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $750+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Corvette C8 presents a mix of performance and potential problems. While the powertrain offers impressive performance, the Active Fuel Management system can be a source of concern with lifter failure and the DCT can exhibit harsh shifting behavior. Electrical glitches, especially with the infotainment system and battery drain, are frequently reported. Suspension issues with the magnetic ride control system can also arise. Interior trim, seat, and targa top issues are also things to watch out for. The severity of the problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially reaching into the thousands of dollars. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the car, obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic familiar with Corvettes, and be aware of these potential issues.
