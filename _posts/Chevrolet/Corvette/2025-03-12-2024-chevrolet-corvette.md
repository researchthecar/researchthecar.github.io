**Summary**

The 2024 Chevrolet Corvette, while a performance-oriented and stylish car, does exhibit a few common issues. Engine problems, specifically related to AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting and fluid leaks, are also a concern. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and battery drain are relatively common, while suspension issues typically revolve around the MagneRide system. Interior issues, like seat cooling fan malfunctions and dashboard glare, are more of an annoyance than a major mechanical problem. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and carefully inspect any used Corvette before purchase. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major repairs, with repair costs varying accordingly.
