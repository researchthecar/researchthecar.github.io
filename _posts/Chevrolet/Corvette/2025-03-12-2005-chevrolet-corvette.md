Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2005 Chevrolet Corvette (C6), structured to fit your website format.

Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. People loved the improved handling, refreshed styling, and updated interior compared to the C5. Common dislikes included some perceived cost-cutting in interior materials and early reliability issues with certain components.
