The 2012 Chevrolet Corvette marked the final year of the C6 generation, offering a blend of performance and value. Engine options included the base 6.2L LS3 V8 producing 430 horsepower and 424 lb-ft of torque (436 hp/428 lb-ft with the optional NPP exhaust) and the high-performance 7.0L LS7 V8 in the Z06 producing 505 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque, and the supercharged 6.2L LS9 V8 in the ZR1 producing 638 horsepower and 604 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Corvette's powerful engines, nimble handling, and relatively affordable price point. Criticisms often include the somewhat dated interior, road noise, and occasionally, concerns about reliability.

**Engine**

**6.2L LS3 V8**

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, rough idle, misfires, and potential loss of power. Can eventually lead to catastrophic engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of valve springs, often with aftermarket upgraded springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harmonic Balancer Wobble/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible wobble of the harmonic balancer pulley, belt squeal, vibrations, and potential for complete separation of the balancer, leading to belt damage and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the harmonic balancer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.0L LS7 V8**

*   **Valve Guide Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, excessive oil consumption, smoking from the exhaust, and potential loss of power. Due to soft valve guides, the valves develop excessive play, leading to oil leaks and eventual engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder heads or machining and replacing the valve guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L LS9 V8**

*   **Supercharger Intercooler Brick Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of coolant, reduced supercharger performance, and potential for hydrolock (coolant entering the cylinders). The intercooler bricks inside the supercharger snout can develop cracks and leak coolant into the intake manifold.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the supercharger intercooler bricks or the entire supercharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and eventual complete loss of clutch function. Can be caused by worn friction material or a failing clutch master/slave cylinder.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement, including pressure plate, disc, and throw-out bearing. May also require replacement of the master/slave cylinder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, erratic shifting, and eventual complete loss of transmission function.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. May also require transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Cracking (Especially on Z06 models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Visible cracks in the composite leaf spring.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf spring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Shock Absorber Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, clunking noises, and potential for fluid leaks from the shocks. The MRC shocks are prone to failure over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MRC shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Steering Column Lock (SCL) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Service Steering Column Lock" message on the DIC, inability to start the car, and potential for being stranded. A common issue in C6 Corvettes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the SCL module, reprogramming, or installation of a bypass module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: Some related recalls in earlier C6 years, but not specifically the 2012 model. Check with the VIN.

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery after short periods of inactivity. Can be caused by parasitic draw from various electronic modules.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This could involve replacing a faulty module or repairing wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Motor Gear Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights failing to raise or lower properly, grinding noises when the headlight switch is activated. The plastic gears in the headlight motor assembly are prone to stripping.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight motor gear or the entire headlight motor assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Delamination of Dash/Console Leather (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leather separating from the underlying material on the dashboard, door panels, and center console.
    *   Solution: Professional reupholstering or replacement of the affected panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2012 Chevrolet Corvette, while a capable performance car, has its share of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly valve spring failures and valve guide wear (especially on the LS7 Z06), are concerning due to the potential for significant repair costs. Electrical issues like the Steering Column Lock failure can be inconvenient and costly to fix. Suspension issues such as leaf spring cracking and MRC shock failure can affect the car's handling and ride quality. While some issues are relatively minor (headlight motors), others can lead to substantial expenses, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
