The 2011 Chevrolet Corvette represents the sixth generation (C6) of this iconic American sports car. It's a popular choice for enthusiasts due to its blend of performance, style, and relatively attainable price point. Engine options included the base 6.2L LS3 V8 producing 430 hp and 424 lb-ft of torque (436 hp/428 lb-ft with the optional NPP exhaust), and the high-performance 7.0L LS7 V8 found in the Z06, delivering 505 hp and 470 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Corvette's powerful engines, sharp handling, and comfortable interior (especially for a sports car). Common complaints include the car's low ground clearance, susceptibility to road noise, and some concerns about interior materials quality.

Engine problems, particularly valve spring/guide wear in the LS3 and LS7 respectively, can be expensive to address. The clutch master cylinder and torque converter can also be common issues. Suspension issues and electrical gremlins can add to the overall cost of ownership.
