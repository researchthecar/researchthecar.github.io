The 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD Classic is a workhorse truck, known for its ruggedness and towing capability. Available engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque) and the legendary 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (360 hp, 650 lb-ft of torque). A gasoline-powered 8.1L Vortec V8 was also available, but is less common. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic for gasoline engines and a 6-speed Allison automatic for the Duramax diesel. Owners often praised the truck's strong engine, particularly the Duramax, its towing capacity, and its simple, durable design. Common complaints include the dated interior, some reliability issues as the trucks age, and fuel economy. The "Classic" designation indicates it's the older body style carried over from the previous generation, offered alongside the redesigned 2007 Silverado.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and blue exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and consider switching to a higher viscosity oil. In severe cases, engine work such as piston ring replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for major engine work

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts are a common issue, leading to exhaust leaks, a ticking noise (especially when cold), and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken bolts and possibly the exhaust manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the shop and number of bolts to remove.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (LBZ)**
*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LBZ Duramax is generally regarded as one of the most reliable Duramax engines, but fuel injector failures can still occur. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, black or white smoke, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ for replacing all injectors.

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD Classic, while a capable truck, does have several common issues. Engine problems like oil consumption and exhaust manifold bolts are concerns, particularly for the 6.0L gasoline engine. Transmission issues, such as soft shifting on the 4L60E and torque converter problems with the Allison 1000, can lead to costly repairs. Suspension wear and tear (pitman/idler arms, ball joints) are also common. Electrical glitches with the instrument cluster and door locks can be frustrating. Finally, rust, particularly on rocker panels and cab corners, is a significant issue in certain regions. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the truck for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
