    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler. Inspect for collateral damage to other engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 Series 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping between gears, abnormal noises, difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Inspect the transmission for further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+ (includes torque converter and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, failure to shift into certain gears, transmission error codes.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty shift solenoid(s). Requires dropping the transmission pan and potentially valve body removal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on the number of solenoids and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Internal Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slippage, especially under heavy load, burnt smell from transmission fluid, reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Complete transmission rebuild or replacement. Requires specialized knowledge and equipment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (depending on extent of damage and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, poor handling, uneven tire wear, visible cracks or damage to leaf springs.
