### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly concerning the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in its V8 engines, which can lead to lifter failure and oil consumption. The 4L60-E transmission, while generally robust, can experience torque converter problems or overheating. Electrical issues, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, are also noted. Rust can be a concern on older models, especially in harsh climates. Addressing these potential problems proactively can help ensure the longevity and reliability of the Tahoe.
