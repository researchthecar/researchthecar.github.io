The 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. It was a popular choice for families and those needing a capable vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe, while a reliable SUV in many respects, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues like oil consumption (5.3L) and intake manifold leaks (4.8L) can lead to moderate to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, particularly with slipping and harsh shifting of the 4L60E, can also be expensive to address. Electrical problems such as instrument cluster failures and power window issues are less critical but can be frustrating. The rocker panel rust and sagging headliner are cosmetic issues, but are common. Overall, prospective buyers should inspect potential Tahoes carefully, paying close attention to engine sounds and performance, transmission shifting, and the condition of the body and electrical systems.
