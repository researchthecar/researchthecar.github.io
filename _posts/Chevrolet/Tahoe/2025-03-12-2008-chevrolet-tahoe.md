**Engine**

**4.8L V8**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in severe cases, a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8 (Including AFM/DOD)**
*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Oil Pressure Management (DOD) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noises from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and reduced power. Check engine light may illuminate. Occurs due to AFM lifters collapsing and damaging the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, camshaft, and potentially the VLOM (Valve Lifter Oil Manifold). AFM disable kits are also available to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Can lead to engine damage if not monitored. Can be exacerbated by AFM issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in severe cases, a complete engine rebuild. AFM disable kits may help if related to AFM issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+

*   **Knocking Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: A loud knocking noise may be heard at the front of the engine. This is more common in the 5.3L engines with AFM. The noise is a result of a failed lifter. The noise will start off quiet and gradually grow to become more loud as the lifter worsens.
    * Solution: Replace the failed lifter. Replace the camshaft if it has been damaged. Disable AFM/DOD to prevent future failure.

**Summary**

The 2008 Chevrolet Tahoe, while offering a comfortable ride and ample space, is prone to several issues. The most concerning are the engine problems, particularly with the 5.3L V8, due to AFM lifter failure and oil consumption. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60E and 6L80E, are also common. Suspension issues with the Autoride system, if equipped, can lead to costly repairs. While some electrical and interior issues are present, the engine and transmission problems tend to be the most severe and expensive to address. Addressing these potential issues will require spending a considerable amount of money on repairs.
