    * Solution: Disabling the AFM system or replacing the AFM lifters can resolve the problem.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Slipping Gears:** The transmission may experience slipping gears, resulting in difficulty shifting and loss of power.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Problems:** Some owners have reported shifting issues, such as rough shifting or delayed gear engagement.
    * Solution: The problem may be caused by a faulty transmission control module (TCM) or a worn transmission valve body. Repairing or replacing these components can resolve the issue.
