### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe is a capable and generally reliable full-size SUV, especially with its larger V8 engines. However, common issues to be aware of include the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the 5.3L V8, which can lead to lifter problems. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60-E, such as torque converter problems, are also noted. Suspension components like wheel bearings and, on models with Autoride, the air suspension system, can require attention. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and occasional alternator failures are also reported. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling are cosmetic but can be costly to repair. Interior climate control blend door actuators are a frequent point of failure. Despite these potential issues, many Tahoes have proven durable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
