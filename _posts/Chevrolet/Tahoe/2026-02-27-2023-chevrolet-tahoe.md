### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its gasoline V8 engines and standard suspension. The primary areas of concern are the 3.0L Duramax diesel engine, which can experience DPF regeneration issues if not driven appropriately, and the 10-speed automatic transmission, which may exhibit occasional shifting anomalies. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and premature 12V battery drain, have also been reported, though often resolvable with software updates or minor component replacements. For buyers prioritizing gasoline power and a straightforward driving experience, the Tahoe is a strong contender. Those opting for the diesel should be mindful of driving habits to ensure optimal DPF function.
