### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Tahoe is a capable and generally reliable full-size SUV, especially when equipped with the 4.8L or 6.0L engines. The more common 5.3L engine can experience issues related to Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifters and intake manifold gaskets, which are important to monitor. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60-E, often involve torque converter shudder or overheating, requiring attention. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are typical wear items for a vehicle of this size and age. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can also occur. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, is a common concern. Overall, while not immune to problems, the 2004 Tahoe offers a solid platform with manageable potential repairs for those who perform regular maintenance and address issues promptly.
