### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Chevrolet Tahoe is a capable and generally reliable full-size SUV, particularly praised for its V8 power and utility. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter problems and oil consumption related to the 5.3L engine. Transmission issues, primarily torque converter shudder and delayed shifting, are also reported. Electrical gremlins, including infotainment system glitches and battery drain, can occur. Interior components like blend door actuators and power seat adjusters are also noted areas for potential repair. Despite these points, with proper maintenance and awareness of these specific potential problems, the Tahoe can offer many years of service.
