### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly concerning its exterior and interior components, which show no widespread issues. The powertrain, while robust, has a few documented concerns, most notably with the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in both V8 engines, which can lead to lifter and oil consumption problems. Transmission issues, while not pervasive, can include torque converter problems in the 6-speed and occasional shifting hesitations in the 10-speed. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also reported. Addressing these potential issues proactively, especially the AFM system, can contribute to long-term reliability for this capable SUV.
