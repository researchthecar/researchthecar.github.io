The 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV that offers a blend of capability, comfort, and spaciousness. It was offered with three engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), though the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 and 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 were primarily on the Silverado trucks. The 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 engine was the most common engine available for the Tahoe. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (6L80) or 8-speed automatic transmission (8L90). Owners often praise the Tahoe for its spacious interior, strong towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Common complaints include reports of transmission issues, particularly shuddering, and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (L83)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, especially at low speeds or when transitioning between V8 and V4 mode. Can cause a ticking or knocking noise. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to cylinder misfires (e.g., P0300) are common.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected lifters and potentially the camshaft. In some cases, disabling AFM is considered a preventative measure after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil level drops significantly between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust. This is often related to the AFM system and valve seals.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing valve seals, potentially addressing AFM issues. Some owners resort to more frequent oil changes and monitoring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Purge Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the vehicle after refueling, rough idling, check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the purge valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (6L80)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibration felt, primarily at highway speeds or under light acceleration. This can often be felt in the seat.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or performing a transmission flush with a specific fluid designed to mitigate shudder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or rough shifts between gears, particularly when downshifting. A clunking noise may be heard during shifts.
    *   Solution: Transmission flush, valve body replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (If Equipped) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, bouncing, or uneven handling. Error messages related to the suspension system may appear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected magnetic ride control shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per shock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for an extended period. Difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identifying the parasitic draw causing the drain. Common culprits include the infotainment system, door lock actuators, and OnStar module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, reboots unexpectedly, or experiences touchscreen unresponsiveness.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacing the infotainment system module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera displays a black screen, distorted image, or fails to activate when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution: Replacing the backup camera or repairing wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate fails to open or close properly, gets stuck, or makes unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts, motor, or latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks develop on the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates or with prolonged sun exposure.

    * Solution: Recharge the AC system, replace a leaking component, or replace the AC compressor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe can be a reliable and capable SUV, but it's essential to be aware of common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine (AFM lifter failure and oil consumption) and transmission (torque converter shudder). Electrical glitches and interior issues like dashboard cracks are also reported. While some problems are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like engine or transmission repairs, can be costly. Carefully inspecting a used 2015 Tahoe and obtaining a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
