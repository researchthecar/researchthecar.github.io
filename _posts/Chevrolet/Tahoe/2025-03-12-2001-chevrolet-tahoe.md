The 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and truck-like underpinnings. It was offered with several engine options, including a 4.8L V8 (275 hp, 290 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (285 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.7L V8 (255 hp, 330 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Tahoe for its comfort and utility but criticize its fuel economy and some reliability issues common for vehicles of that age.

**Summary**

The 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe is a capable SUV that offers plenty of space and utility. However, it is important to be aware of the common issues that can arise with age. Engine problems such as piston slap, oil consumption, and intake manifold leaks can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60E, are also a significant concern. Suspension components are also prone to wear and tear. Electrical and interior issues such as fuel gauge problems, power window failure, and dash cracking are typical for a vehicle of this age. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, especially engine and transmission work. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
