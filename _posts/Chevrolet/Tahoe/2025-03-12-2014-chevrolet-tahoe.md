The 2014 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. It offers three trim levels: LS, LT, and LTZ. Engine options included the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 horsepower, 383 lb-ft of torque). A six-speed automatic transmission was standard across the board. Owners often appreciate the Tahoe's ability to haul passengers and cargo, as well as its traditional SUV styling. Common dislikes include its large size, which can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and fuel economy that isn't stellar.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (L83)**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, misfires, rough running, reduced fuel economy, and eventual engine damage. This is related to the AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. The lifters that collapse to disable the cylinders can fail, leading to the aforementioned symptoms.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often including replacement of all lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on extent of damage and AFM deletion option).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs. This can be caused by several factors, including piston ring issues, valve seal wear, or problems with the PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) system.
    * Solution: Diagnose the cause of the oil consumption. Replacement of piston rings or valve seals may be necessary.  Repairing or replacing the PCV valve may also resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (highly variable depending on the cause and extent of the repair).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EVAP Purge Solenoid Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, difficulty fueling, rough idle. The purge solenoid valve can fail, preventing the engine from properly purging fuel vapors from the EVAP system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the EVAP purge solenoid valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 Six-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration, especially at lower speeds and light throttle. This is often caused by wear or degradation of the torque converter clutch.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the torque converter. A transmission flush with updated fluid may temporarily alleviate the issue, but replacement is the more permanent solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the cause, which may include a transmission flush, valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Autoride/Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, ride height issues, error messages on the dash.  The compressor that maintains the air suspension can fail due to wear or leaks in the system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor. Leaks in the air lines or air springs must also be addressed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Autoride/Air Suspension Air Spring Leaks (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, ride height issues, error messages on the dash. The air springs can develop leaks over time, causing the system to lose pressure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking air springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per air spring + Labor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a parasitic draw from an electrical component, a faulty alternator, or a failing battery.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Repair or replacement of the faulty component, alternator, or battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door locks not functioning properly (failing to lock or unlock), unusual noises from the door.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Radio/Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, glitches, blank screen, loss of audio. These issues can be caused by software glitches or hardware failures.
    * Solution: Software updates, replacement of the radio/infotainment unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or installation of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (cover) - $2000+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Tahoe, while a capable and popular SUV, has some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly related to the Active Fuel Management system and oil consumption, are potential concerns that can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues like torque converter shudder and harsh shifting are also prevalent. Electrical problems, while generally less costly, can still be frustrating. Suspension issues with the Autoride/Air Suspension system, if equipped, can also lead to some headaches. Overall, the 2014 Tahoe can be a good vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
