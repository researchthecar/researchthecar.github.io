The 2004 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and relatively comfortable ride. It was offered with three engine options: a 4.8L Vortec V8 (285 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L Vortec V8 (295 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a high-output 5.3L Vortec V8 (320 hp, 340 lb-ft of torque) available on the Z71 package. All engines were paired with a 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Tahoe's utility and reliability, but common complaints include issues with the instrument cluster, drivetrain malfunctions, and some rust issues.

**Engine**

**4.8L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. This is often noticed after the vehicle has passed 100,000 miles. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The root cause can vary. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose piston ring wear or valve seal issues. Depending on the diagnosis, repair may involve replacing piston rings, valve seals, or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, rough idle, and potential overheating. You might notice coolant dripping near the front of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600

**5.3L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, excessive oil consumption is a common issue, often stemming from the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system (if equipped). Blue smoke from exhaust, frequent need to add oil.
    *   Solution: If AFM is the cause, options include disabling AFM (using a tuner or replacement lifters), replacing piston rings, or replacing valve seals. More severe cases may require a new engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+

*   **Knock Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine hesitation, reduced power, and a check engine light. The code(s) will likely indicate a knock sensor malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty knock sensor(s). It's often recommended to replace both at the same time due to their location under the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, rough idle, and potential overheating. You might notice coolant dripping near the front of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600

**Transmission**

**4L60-E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, slipping out of gear, or failure to shift. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter) - $3000+ (rebuild/replace)

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, or a general loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200

*   **3-4 Clutch Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a common failure point in the 4L60-E. Symptoms include the transmission slipping or failing to shift into fourth gear.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild to replace the 3-4 clutch pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

**Suspension**

*   **Autoride Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, error messages on the dash, or a non-functioning air compressor.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. Consider converting to standard shocks if you don't want to deal with future air suspension issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (compressor replacement), $500 - $1000 (conversion to standard shocks)

*   **Suspension Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Common culprits are ball joints, tie rod ends, and sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component (depending on labor)

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges become inaccurate or stop working altogether. Often, the speedometer is the first to fail.
    *   Solution: Instrument cluster repair or replacement. Some repair shops specialize in rebuilding these clusters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks that don't work or only work intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window does not go up or down properly. May hear clicking noise.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500 per window

**Exterior**

*   **Rust around Wheel Wells and Rocker Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the body, particularly around the wheel wells and rocker panels.
    *   Solution: Repair rust by cutting out the affected areas and welding in new metal, or applying rust inhibitors and body filler if the rust is minor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ per area (depending on severity)

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises behind the dashboard, inability to control temperature or airflow to different vents.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty HVAC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Summary**

The 2004 Chevrolet Tahoe can be a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption, can be costly to address. Transmission issues are common, and can be expensive depending on the severity. Electrical problems are common, but generally not as costly as engine or transmission problems. Rust is a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Pre-purchase inspection and a thorough maintenance history review is always recommended when purchasing a used 2004 Chevrolet Tahoe.
