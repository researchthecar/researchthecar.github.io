The 2012 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options for the 2012 Tahoe include a 4.8L V8 (270 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (320 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L V8 (403 hp, 417 lb-ft of torque) available on the LTZ trim. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Tahoe's roominess, especially for families, and its ability to handle large loads. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy and some reliability concerns, particularly with the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system on the 5.3L V8.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**
No Issues Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 5.3L V8 engines experience excessive oil consumption, often exceeding 1 quart per 1,000 miles. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a potential decrease in engine performance. This is often linked to the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system.
    *   Solution: Potential solutions include replacing the valve cover (revised design), replacing the AFM lifters with non-AFM lifters, or installing an AFM disabler device.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the chosen solution and extent of damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to various issues. These include rough idling, misfires, and the aforementioned excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: As mentioned above, a solution is replacing the valve cover (revised design), replacing the AFM lifters with non-AFM lifters, or installing an AFM disabler device.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+ (depending on the chosen solution and extent of damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**
No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration felt during light acceleration or at highway speeds. Often most noticeable when the transmission is trying to lock the torque converter.
    *   Solution: A complete transmission flush and fluid change or replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Autoride System Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Autoride system, which provides electronically controlled damping, can experience failures. Symptoms include a rough ride, sagging suspension, and error messages on the dashboard. Compressors can fail, as well as the shocks themselves.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed Autoride shocks, compressor, or sensors. Sometimes aftermarket replacements without Autoride are a cheaper option if you do not care for the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the component and if using OEM or aftermarket parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument panel cluster can exhibit various problems, including malfunctioning gauges (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.) and flickering displays.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument panel cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuators, responsible for locking and unlocking the doors, can fail. This results in doors that won't lock or unlock properly, or a door that only locks or unlocks sporadically.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate mechanism can fail, causing the liftgate to not open or close automatically, or to get stuck in one position.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts, motor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard material in 2007-2014 GMT900 trucks and SUVs are prone to cracking, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or installing a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,500+ for replacement. Dashboard covers usually cost less than $100.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Tahoe can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly with the 5.3L V8 engine and the transmission. The AFM system's problems leading to excessive oil consumption can result in significant repair costs. Electrical issues and suspension problems also contribute to potential maintenance expenses. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission work, can be costly. A thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended before purchasing a used 2012 Tahoe to identify potential issues and budget accordingly.
