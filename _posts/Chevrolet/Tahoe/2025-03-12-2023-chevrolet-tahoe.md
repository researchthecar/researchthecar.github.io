Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe, categorized by component and engine/transmission configuration, following your specified format.

The 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and comfortable ride. It offers three engine choices: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 generating 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel producing 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Tahoe's towing capacity, passenger space, and updated technology. Common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver, fuel economy concerns, and some reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Lifter Failure/Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common complaint involves the failure of one or more lifters, often accompanied by a distinct ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, and a potential loss of power. Can occur at relatively low mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters and potentially the camshaft if it has been damaged. Some have found that flushing the oil may help to resolve the issue if caught early enough.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: AFM/DFM is designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders. However, issues can arise, leading to rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Disabling the AFM/DFM system through aftermarket programmers or tuners or through the dealer. Replacement of faulty solenoids or lifters may be necessary if mechanical failures have occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Lifter Failure/Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, the 6.2L can experience lifter failures, presenting as a ticking noise, rough running, and potential loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty lifters and potentially the camshaft.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is sometimes reported, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be linked to PCV valve issues or cylinder wall scoring.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the cause (PCV valve, cylinder leakdown test). Replacement of PCV valve, or engine rebuild in severe cases of cylinder scoring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5,000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported fuel injector failures leading to rough idling, reduced power, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult starting, especially in cold weather, can indicate glow plug failure. The engine may run rough until warmed up.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty glow plug(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears, or hesitation when accelerating. This can manifest as a "clunk" or "jerk" during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibrating sensation, especially at lower speeds and light throttle, can indicate a torque converter issue.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush/change with updated fluid, or torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Ride Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicles equipped with the air ride suspension system may experience failures in the air compressor, air struts, or height sensors. This can lead to a sagging suspension, uneven ride height, and error messages on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty component (compressor, strut, or sensor).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, including freezing, lagging, screen blackouts, and connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets, or replacement of the infotainment module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the vehicle (e.g., oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors) can fail, leading to check engine lights, performance issues, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty sensor and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Malfunctions**

**Summary**

The 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe can be a great vehicle, but it's not without its potential issues. The most common and potentially costly problems revolve around engine lifter failures, particularly in the 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines. The 10-speed transmission can also exhibit shifting issues that require diagnosis and potentially more involved repairs. Electrical glitches and sensor failures are also common issues that need to be addressed. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can run into the thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and ensure a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2023 Tahoe, especially checking for engine noises or transmission issues.
