The 2022 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV offering a blend of comfort, capability, and technology. Engine options include the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), the 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and the 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Tahoe's spacious interior, smooth ride, and powerful engine options. Common complaints include the high price, large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and some reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light, and potential for significant engine damage if the failed lifter damages the camshaft. Often occurs at relatively low mileage.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected lifters and camshaft. Some owners opt to delete the AFM/DFM system entirely to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and chosen repair method).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Chevrolet Tahoe, while generally a well-regarded SUV, has some potential issues that buyers should be aware of. The most concerning are the potential for AFM/DFM lifter failure on the V8 engines, which can be costly to repair, and the potential transmission issues that can range from software glitches to more serious mechanical problems. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and battery drain are also relatively common complaints. While not all Tahoes will experience these issues, being aware of them can help buyers make an informed decision and potentially negotiate a better price or purchase an extended warranty. The cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue and the repair shop.
