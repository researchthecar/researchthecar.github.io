### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe is generally a reliable large SUV, particularly in its core mechanical components. The 5.3L V8 engine is a strong performer, though owners should be aware of potential issues with the Active Fuel Management system (lifters) and oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. The 6-speed automatic transmission is robust but can experience torque converter shudder or shifting problems that require attention. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Interior components like power seat actuators can fail. Despite these points, with proper maintenance and awareness of common issues, the Tahoe can provide dependable service.
