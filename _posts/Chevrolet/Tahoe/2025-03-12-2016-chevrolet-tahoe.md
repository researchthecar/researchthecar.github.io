The 2016 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 engine, producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (6L80). Some owners appreciate the Tahoe's roomy interior, powerful V8 engine, and capability for hauling and towing. However, common complaints revolve around transmission issues, electrical problems, and the fuel economy typical of a large SUV.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, engine knocking or ticking, and potential premature spark plug fouling. The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can lead to increased oil usage and carbon buildup.
    *   Solution: Disabling the AFM system via a tuner or installing an AFM disabler device. Replacing the affected pistons and piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, and potential misfires. This can be related to the AFM system, especially in vehicles that have high mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters, potentially the camshaft and valve train components, and deleting the AFM system (optional)

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Flashing the transmission control module (TCM) with updated software. Replacement of the valve body. Replacement of the entire transmission (in severe cases).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or vibrating sensation, particularly at highway speeds when the torque converter locks up.
    *   Solution: Flushing the transmission fluid with the updated Mobil Delvac ATF, replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (If Equipped) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially over bumps. Reduced ride quality, with a harsher or bouncier feel. Warning lights on the dashboard related to the suspension system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty shocks, struts, and potentially the Magnetic Ride Control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500 per shock/strut

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Tahoe has a few common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The AFM system and associated oil consumption/lifter failure in the 5.3L V8 are the most significant concerns, potentially leading to costly repairs. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting and torque converter shudder, are also prevalent. Electrical issues can be a nuisance, and dashboard cracking is a common cosmetic problem. Overall, while the Tahoe is a capable and comfortable SUV, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and address any identified issues before purchase.
