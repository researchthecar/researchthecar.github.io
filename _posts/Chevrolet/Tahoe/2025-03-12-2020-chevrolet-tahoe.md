The 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and towing capability. Available engines include a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Tahoe is praised for its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and overall versatility, while some common complaints include its size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces and its relatively poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) / Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illumination (often with codes P0300, P0301-P0308 related to cylinder misfires), excessive oil consumption, and potential for internal engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected AFM/DFM lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners opt to delete the AFM/DFM system entirely by installing a non-AFM/DFM camshaft and appropriate tuning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and chosen repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. This can be related to the AFM/DFM lifter issue or other factors like piston ring issues.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the cause. It may involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or addressing issues with the AFM/DFM system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) / Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10L80/10L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Clunking noises during gear changes or acceleration/deceleration.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and potentially replacing valve body components, solenoids, or reprogramming the transmission control module (TCM). In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates or fails to engage properly, leading to a loss of power or delayed acceleration.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the underlying cause, which may involve replacing valve body components, solenoids, or the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $6,000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride quality, excessive bouncing, or a noticeable difference in suspension performance between different corners of the vehicle. Check engine light may or may not be illuminated. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to the MRC system may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected MRC shocks and/or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per shock/strut, plus labor for diagnostics and replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches/Freezing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or exhibits erratic behavior. This may include issues with the navigation system, Bluetooth connectivity, or audio functions.

**Summary**

The 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe, while generally a reliable vehicle, has some potential issues owners may encounter. The most significant and potentially costly problems are related to the AFM/DFM system in both the 5.3L and 6.2L engines, leading to lifter failure and excessive oil consumption. Transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting, can also be a concern. Electrical glitches, such as infotainment system problems and battery drain, can be frustrating. The severity and cost of these issues vary greatly depending on the specific problem and the required repairs. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify and address any potential problems before buying a used 2020 Tahoe.
