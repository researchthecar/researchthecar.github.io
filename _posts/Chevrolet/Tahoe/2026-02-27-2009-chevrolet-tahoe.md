### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet Tahoe is a generally robust vehicle, particularly its V8 powertrains. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the 5.3L and 6.0L engines, which can lead to oil consumption and internal component wear. Transmission issues, primarily with the 4L60-E, can include torque converter problems and solenoid failures. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are subject to wear, and optional Autoride systems can experience compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and premature alternator failure are also noted. While these issues exist, they are not necessarily universal, and many Tahoes perform reliably with proper maintenance. Addressing AFM system concerns proactively can mitigate more significant engine damage.
