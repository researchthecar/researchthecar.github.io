**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illumination, and potential engine damage. The AFM/DFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but the lifters can fail, causing the valve to remain closed.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (depending on extent of damage and repair shop).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes, requiring frequent top-offs.
    * Solution: Various solutions have been attempted, including software updates to the engine control module (ECM), replacement of the PCV valve, or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $7,000+

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe, while offering improvements over previous generations, is prone to several common issues. The most significant issues are related to the engine (especially AFM/DFM lifter failures and excessive oil consumption on the 5.3L and 6.2L engines) and the 10-speed transmission. Electrical and suspension issues are also common. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs potentially costing thousands of dollars. These issues can affect the overall ownership experience and should be considered when evaluating a used 2021 Tahoe.
