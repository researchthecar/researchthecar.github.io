### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe, particularly with the 5.3L V8 engine, presents a generally solid platform but has known potential issues. The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system is a common source of concern, with lifter failures and oil consumption being the most frequently reported problems. Transmission issues, primarily related to the torque converter and fluid leaks, also appear in owner reports. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear, and if equipped, the rear air suspension requires attention. Electrical gremlins, such as power window motors and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon. While not overwhelmingly problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection focusing on the AFM system and transmission health.
