**Engine**

**4.8L Vortec 4800 V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-expected oil consumption, especially in Tahoes with higher mileage. Symptoms include needing to add oil between changes and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Addressing this issue can involve trying a different oil viscosity, checking for leaks, replacing valve stem seals, or, in severe cases, replacing piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+

**5.3L Vortec 5300 V8**

*   **"Piston Slap"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking sound, often most noticeable at cold start-up. This is related to the piston to cylinder wall clearance.
    *   Solution: In many cases, this noise is considered "normal" and doesn't affect the engine's reliability. However, some owners opt for engine rebuilds if the noise is excessive or accompanied by other symptoms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if deemed normal) - $3,000+
*   **Failed Fuel Injector**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough Idle, poor fuel economy, check engine light illuminated.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-expected oil consumption, especially in Tahoes with higher mileage. Symptoms include needing to add oil between changes and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Addressing this issue can involve trying a different oil viscosity, checking for leaks, replacing valve stem seals, or, in severe cases, replacing piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
*   **Faulty Oil Pressure Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil pressure gauge will fail to read accurately.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**5.7L Vortec 5700 V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4L60E Four-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, especially during acceleration. This is often caused by worn clutch packs or a failing solenoid. Additionally, it can cause a harsh shift from gear to gear.
    *   Solution: A transmission rebuild or replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at highway speeds, can indicate a torque converter problem.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
*   **Transmission Fluid Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reddish fluid under the vehicle and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak (seals, lines, pan gasket).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Suspension**

*   **Sagging Rear Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sags, especially when loaded. Leaf springs weaken over time.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges may stop working, flicker, or display inaccurate readings.

**Summary**

The 2000 Chevrolet Tahoe, while generally reliable, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems such as oil consumption and "piston slap" (particularly with the 5.3L) can range from minor annoyances to requiring significant repairs. The 4L60E transmission is prone to slipping and harsh shifting, potentially leading to costly rebuilds or replacements. Suspension and electrical issues, while less severe, can add to the overall maintenance burden. Rust is also a prevalent concern, especially in regions with harsh weather conditions. The potential cost to address these issues ranges from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the severity and complexity of the repair.
