### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Chevrolet Tahoe is a capable and generally reliable full-size SUV, particularly its standard 5.3L V8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. The most frequently reported significant issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system's lifters and potential oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as torque converter problems and solenoid failures, are also noted but not universally prevalent. For models equipped with the optional Autoride suspension, compressor failures can occur. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system and power accessories, are also present. Despite these potential concerns, many owners find the Tahoe to be a durable vehicle when properly maintained, with most issues being repairable.
