- **Solution:** Replacement of lifters, camshaft, and potentially AFM disabler module installation.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,000

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning, requiring frequent top-offs.
- **Solution:** Can be related to piston rings, valve seals, or PCV system; may require engine internal repairs.
- **Cost:** $800 - $2,500


## Transmission

### 6-Speed Automatic (6L80/6L90)
**Torque Converter Shudder**
- **Symptoms:** Vibrations or shuddering felt during acceleration, especially at lower speeds.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid flush and fill, torque converter replacement.
- **Cost:** $700 - $1,800

**Delayed Shifting or Slipping**
- **Symptoms:** Hesitation when shifting gears, or the transmission slipping out of gear.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid service, solenoid replacement, or complete transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $1,200 - $3,500

### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Chevrolet Tahoe is a generally reliable full-size SUV, particularly praised for its powerful V8 engine and robust build. The most commonly cited technical issues revolve around the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 engine's Active Fuel Management system, which can lead to lifter problems and oil consumption if not addressed. Transmission issues, such as torque converter shudder and delayed shifting, are also reported, though often manageable with proper maintenance. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, can occur. While suspension and exterior components are typically durable, optional Magnetic Ride Control shocks can develop leaks. Interior climate control blend door actuators are a known, albeit relatively minor, repair. Overall, the Tahoe offers solid dependability, but owners should be aware of potential AFM-related engine concerns and transmission maintenance needs.
