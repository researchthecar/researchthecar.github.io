### 5.3L V8 (RPO LMG/PZ5)
**Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Engine misfires, rough idle, ticking noise from the engine, check engine light illumination.
- **Solution:** Replacement of failed lifters, often recommended to disable AFM system or replace with a non-AFM camshaft and lifters.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,000

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning, requiring frequent top-offs.

### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Chevrolet Tahoe is a generally reliable full-size SUV, particularly with its common 5.3L V8 engine. The most frequently cited significant issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, which can lead to lifter failure and increased oil consumption if not addressed. Transmission issues, such as torque converter problems and solenoid failures in the 6-speed automatic, are also noted but not universally reported. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and the Body Control Module, can occur. Overall, with proper maintenance and attention to potential AFM and transmission concerns, the 2010 Tahoe can remain a dependable vehicle.
