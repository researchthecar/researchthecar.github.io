Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2017 Chevrolet Tahoe, organized by category and powertrain configuration.

The 2017 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options included the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, and the optional 6.2L EcoTec3 V8, delivering 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The 5.3L V8 was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2L V8 came with a more modern 8-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Tahoe's versatility and capability. Common complaints include fuel economy, some reliability concerns, and the high price point.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, rough running, and potentially engine damage. This is due to the AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, causing premature wear or failure of the lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder head. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system with aftermarket programmers or replace the entire system with non-AFM components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity of the damage and repair approach.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: Some dealerships may perform an oil consumption test and potentially replace valve seals or piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ for valve seal replacement; $3,000 - $7,000+ for piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves (Direct Injection Related)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, hesitation upon acceleration, reduced fuel economy. Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing over the valves to keep them clean.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the intake valves via walnut blasting or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 5.3L V8)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, particularly when cold.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid and filter; $800 - $1,500 for valve body; $3,000 - $5,000+ for rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.2L V8)**

*   **"Chevy Shake" Shudder/Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration or shuddering, particularly at low speeds or during light acceleration. Often described as a "Chevy Shake" due to its prevalence in GM vehicles equipped with this transmission.
    *   Solution: Multiple solutions have been attempted, including transmission fluid flushes with updated fluid, torque converter replacement, and transmission replacement. The root cause is often debated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 for fluid flush; $1,000 - $2,000 for torque converter; $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (If Equipped) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bumpy or harsh ride, sagging suspension, error messages related to the suspension system. The Magnetic Ride Control shocks can leak or fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty Magnetic Ride Control shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per shock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, or unresponsive touchscreen. Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the HMI (Human Machine Interface) module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update; $500 - $1,200+ for HMI replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle's battery draining overnight or within a short period of time, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the parasitic draw. Common culprits include faulty door lock actuators, OnStar modules, or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain and the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates. This is often due to sun exposure and the type of plastic used.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ for dashboard replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Tahoe, while a capable and versatile SUV, has its share of common issues. Engine problems, particularly AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption in the 5.3L V8, are significant concerns that can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, especially the "Chevy Shake" with the 8-speed automatic, can be frustrating. Electrical glitches and interior trim problems add to the list of potential headaches. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and repair costs can vary widely. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2017 Tahoe.
