The 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. It was offered with three engine options: a 4.8L V8 producing 285 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 5.3L V8 producing 295 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque (LM7), and a higher-output 5.3L V8 producing 320 horsepower and 340 lb-ft of torque (L59). All engines were paired with a 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Tahoe's versatility and ability to haul passengers and cargo. Common dislikes include fuel economy and some reliability concerns.

    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to premature engine wear if not monitored and addressed.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks. If consumption is excessive, consider changing to a higher viscosity oil or repairing/replacing worn valve seals or piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 (Oil fill) - $2,000+ (Engine rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8 (LM7/L59)**

* **Oil Consumption**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 (Oil fill) - $2,000+ (Engine rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Knock Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Faulty knock sensors can trigger a check engine light and potentially reduce engine performance. This can be caused by coolant leaks getting into the sensor.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty knock sensor(s). Address any coolant leaks that may be affecting the sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500
