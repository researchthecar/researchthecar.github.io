### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Chevrolet Tahoe, particularly with the 5.3L V8 engine, is a capable and generally reliable full-size SUV. The most frequently cited technical issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, which can lead to costly repairs if lifters fail, and occasional oil consumption concerns. Transmission issues, while not universal, can include torque converter problems and solenoid failures. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and power accessory failures, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components tend to be robust, with no widespread critical failures reported. Regular maintenance, especially monitoring oil levels and addressing AFM system warnings promptly, is crucial for long-term reliability.
