### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe demonstrates solid reliability for its powertrain options, with the V8 engines being particularly robust. The Duramax diesel, while efficient, has seen some reports of DPF regeneration issues, which is not uncommon for modern diesel engines. Transmission performance is generally good, though occasional software-related shifting anomalies have been noted. Electrical systems, especially the infotainment unit, are the most frequent source of reported glitches, with screen unresponsiveness and battery drain being the primary concerns. Optional features like the Air Ride suspension and power liftgate have also had isolated reports of malfunctions. Overall, the Tahoe is a dependable large SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of the common electrical and specific diesel engine concerns.
