Okay, here is the information you requested on the 2002 Chevrolet Astra, formatted for your website.

The 2002 Chevrolet Astra, a compact car sold primarily in Europe and other global markets, was not officially sold in the United States under the Chevrolet brand. However, it was sold in the U.S. as the Saturn Astra starting in 2008. The 2002 Astra offered a range of engine options depending on the market, including 1.4L, 1.6L, 1.8L, and 2.0L gasoline engines, as well as 1.7L and 2.0L diesel engines. The most common engine on the 2002 Astra was the 1.6L inline 4-cylinder engine, producing approximately 100 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners typically praised the Astra for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and practical hatchback design. Common dislikes included its relatively bland styling and the potential for certain electrical and mechanical issues. Since the car was primarily sold in Europe, issues are difficult to pinpoint definitively as reliability reports vary across regions.
