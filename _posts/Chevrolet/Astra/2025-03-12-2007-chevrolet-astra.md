The 2007 Chevrolet Astra, while not sold in the US under the Chevrolet nameplate (it was a Saturn Astra), was a rebadged Opel Astra. It was available with a 1.8L inline-4 gasoline engine, producing approximately 140 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. People generally liked the Astra for its European driving feel, fuel efficiency, and hatchback practicality. Dislikes often centered around parts availability (due to it being an Opel), and some interior trim quality concerns, and higher maintenance costs compared to other domestic cars. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet/Saturn Astra, while a decent vehicle, faces some common issues. The coolant leaks and oxygen sensor problems on the 1.8L engine are fairly common and can lead to further engine damage if left unchecked. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can be costly to repair. Suspension wear is typical for a vehicle of this age. Electrical glitches, particularly with power windows and the instrument cluster, can be frustrating but often manageable. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs, making a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing a used model. The cost to fix these issues can be fairly high due to the scarcity of the parts.
