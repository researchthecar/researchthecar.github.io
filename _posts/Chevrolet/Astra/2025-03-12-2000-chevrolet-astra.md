The 2000 Chevrolet Astra, sold primarily in Europe and other international markets, wasn't officially sold in the United States. Therefore, information specific to a "2000 Chevrolet Astra" in a North American context is not readily available. This response will address the European/international market version. The 2000 Astra, part of the G generation (also known as Astra Mk4 in the UK), came with a range of engine options, including petrol and diesel variants. Common petrol engines include the 1.4L, 1.6L, 1.8L, and 2.0L. Common Diesel options include the 1.7L and 2.0L. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and market. Owners often praised the Astra for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and practical design.
