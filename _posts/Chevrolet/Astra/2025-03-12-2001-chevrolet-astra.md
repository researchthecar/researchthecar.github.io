The 2001 Chevrolet Astra, sold primarily in Europe and other international markets (not the North American market, where a completely different Saturn-branded Astra was sold years later), was a compact car known for its fuel efficiency and practicality. Engine options included a range of gasoline and diesel engines. While precise horsepower and torque figures varied depending on the specific engine configuration for the European market, a common gasoline engine was a 1.6L inline-4 producing around 75-100 horsepower. The car's appeal stemmed from its affordability and practicality, although some owners disliked its relatively basic features and potential for certain mechanical issues.
