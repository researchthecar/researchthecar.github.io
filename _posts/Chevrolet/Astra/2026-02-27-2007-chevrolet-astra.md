### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Astra offers a budget-friendly option but comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly for diesel variants and certain electrical components. The 1.9L JTDm diesel engines are prone to DPF and EGR issues, while the manual M32 gearbox can suffer from bearing wear. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or alternator, are also noted. Petrol engines, especially the 1.6L, appear more robust. While suspension and interior generally fare well, potential buyers should be aware of these common faults and factor in potential repair costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating these issues.
