The 2006 Chevrolet Astra, sold primarily in Europe and other global markets (not the US), was a compact car known for its practical design and fuel efficiency. Several engine options were available, including the 1.4L petrol (approximately 90 hp and 92 lb-ft of torque), the 1.6L petrol (approximately 105 hp and 110 lb-ft of torque), the 1.8L petrol (approximately 125 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque), the 2.0L turbo petrol (approximately 170 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque), and the 1.3L diesel, 1.7L diesel, and 1.9L diesel engines. Transmission options typically included 5-speed and 6-speed manual transmissions, as well as a 4-speed automatic (depending on the engine). Owners often appreciated the Astra's affordability, practicality, and fuel economy, while some criticisms included the somewhat bland interior design and occasional reliability issues. It's important to note that the Vauxhall Astra is nearly identical to the Opel Astra, which are the same vehicle and are both under the General Motors brand.
