The 2008 Chevrolet Astra, sold in North America as a rebadged Saturn Astra, offered a blend of European driving dynamics and practicality. While it was praised for its handling, fuel economy, and distinctive styling, it also faced its share of reliability concerns. Engine choices included a 1.8L inline-4 gasoline engine producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Common complaints centered around electrical gremlins, suspension issues, and some concerns regarding the automatic transmission.
