**Introduction**

The 2001 Chevrolet Astra was a compact car available with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.2-liter Ecotec four-cylinder producing 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder was optional, generating 190 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a five-speed manual and a four-speed automatic.

Despite its affordable price point, the Astra offered a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and decent performance. However, it also came with several drawbacks, such as poor fuel economy, unreliable electronics, and a low-quality interior.
