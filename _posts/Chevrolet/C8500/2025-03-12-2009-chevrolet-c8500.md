**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Diesel (LMM)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, white smoke from exhaust, decreased fuel economy. Can lead to further engine damage if not addressed. Often related to injector failure.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injector(s). Recalibrate fuel injection system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per injector (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, engine overheating. The EGR cooler can crack or leak, causing coolant to enter the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler. Inspect and potentially replace related hoses and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Lack of power, excessive black smoke from exhaust, whining or screeching noises from the turbocharger. Can be caused by oil starvation, worn bearings, or damaged turbine blades.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger issue. Rebuild or replace the turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (parts and labor), depending on the extent of the damage and whether a rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000/2000 Series**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during TCC engagement, poor fuel economy, transmission overheating. The TCC may fail due to wear or fluid contamination.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Flush the transmission fluid and replace the filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+ (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, failure to shift into certain gears, transmission stuck in limp mode. Shift solenoids can fail due to electrical issues or contamination.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty shift solenoid(s). Flush the transmission fluid and replace the filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (parts and labor), depending on the number of solenoids replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Internal Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping, delayed engagement, overheating, low fluid level. Leaks can occur in various locations within the transmission due to worn seals or damaged components.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair the source of the leak. This may involve replacing seals, gaskets, or other internal components. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+, depending on the severity and extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or both sides, reduced ride height, poor ride quality, cracking or broken leaf springs. Leaf springs can weaken over time due to heavy loads and stress.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or damaged leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is consistently used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor ride control, increased body roll during cornering, premature tire wear. Shock absorbers wear out over time and lose their ability to dampen suspension movement.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per axle (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, gauges not working, or starting issues. Wiring harnesses can become damaged due to corrosion, chafing, or heat exposure.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the damaged wiring harness. This may involve splicing wires, replacing connectors, or replacing entire sections of the harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the severity and location of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning electrical systems, such as power windows, door locks, or lighting. The BCM controls various electrical functions and can fail due to internal component issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty BCM. The new BCM may need to be programmed to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust/Corrosion**
