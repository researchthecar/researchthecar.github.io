* **6.6L Duramax Diesel**
    * **Injector Failure:** Description: Malfunctioning of the fuel injectors, leading to poor engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and potential engine damage. Symptoms: Engine misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, reduced power. Solution: Replacement of the failed injectors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+ per injector
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** Description: Failure of the turbocharger, resulting in reduced engine power and performance. Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, black smoke from the exhaust, check engine light illumination. Solution: Replacement or repair of the turbocharger. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Transmission**

* **4L80E Automatic Transmission**
    * **Slipping Gears:** Description: Transmission gears slipping under load, causing acceleration issues and rough shifting. Symptoms: Inability to shift out of certain gears, delayed or erratic gear changes. Solution: Overhaul or replacement of the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
    * **Torque Converter Failure:** Description: Failure of the torque converter, leading to loss of transmission fluid pressure and power transfer. Symptoms: Transmission slipping, overheating, and inability to engage gears. Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
* **Allison 1000 Automatic Transmission**
    * **Sun Shell Failure:** Description: Fracture of the sun shell within the transmission, causing catastrophic transmission failure. Symptoms: Sudden loss of gears, grinding noises, complete inability to drive. Solution: Replacement of the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    * **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Description: Malfunctioning of the shift solenoids, leading to shifting problems, harsh shifts, and check engine light illumination. Symptoms: Erratic gear changes, delayed shifts, transmission slipping. Solution: Replacement of the failed solenoids. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per solenoid

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Failure:** Description: Breakage or sagging of the leaf springs, affecting vehicle stability and ride quality. Symptoms: Uneven ride height, difficulty steering, clunking noises over bumps. Solution: Replacement of the failed leaf springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per axle
* **Shock Absorber Failure:** Description: Malfunctioning or worn shock absorbers, resulting in poor ride quality and handling. Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, reduced braking effectiveness. Solution: Replacement of the shock absorbers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per axle

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Description: Excessive battery drain, leading to premature battery failure and difficulty starting the vehicle. Symptoms: Battery going dead after periods of inactivity. Solution: Identification and repair of the electrical component causing the drain. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the cause
* **Alternator Failure:** Description: Malfunctioning of the alternator, resulting in insufficient charging of the battery and electrical system. Symptoms: Dim headlights, battery warning light illumination, difficulty starting the vehicle. Solution: Replacement of the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
