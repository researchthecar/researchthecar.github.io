The 2004 Chevrolet C8500 is a heavy-duty chassis cab truck designed for commercial applications. Engine options include the Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine (typically ranging from 175-330 horsepower and 420-860 lb-ft of torque) and the Duramax 6.6L diesel. Transmission options commonly include Allison automatic transmissions. Owners often appreciate the C8500's robust build and suitability for demanding tasks, but common complaints include the higher maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty vehicles, diesel engine-specific issues, and the utilitarian nature of the interior.

**Summary**

The 2004 Chevrolet C8500, while a capable workhorse, can present owners with a variety of issues, particularly related to its diesel engines, transmissions, and suspension systems. Engine-related problems, such as injector failures and HEUI pump issues in the Caterpillar 3126, can be costly. The Duramax 6.6L also faces its own challenges, including injector issues with the LB7 engines. Transmission problems, characterized by shift slippage and torque converter failure, are also significant concerns. Suspension issues with leaf springs and bushings will also need to be addressed. Corrosion is always a concern. The severity and cost of these potential repairs indicate that prospective buyers should be aware of these common issues and carefully inspect any used C8500 before purchasing.
