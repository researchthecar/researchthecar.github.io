The 2010 Chevrolet Camaro marked the return of a legendary nameplate, offering a blend of retro styling and modern performance. Engine options included a 3.6L V6 producing 304 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L LS3 V8 (manual transmission) making 426 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.2L L99 V8 (automatic transmission) producing 400 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices consisted of a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Camaro's aggressive looks and powerful engines, but some criticize its limited visibility and rear seat space. Some also find the interior materials to be subpar for a sports car.
