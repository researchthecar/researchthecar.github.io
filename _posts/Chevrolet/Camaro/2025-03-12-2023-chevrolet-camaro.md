The 2023 Chevrolet Camaro marked the final year of production for this iconic muscle car (at least in its current form), and it aimed to leave a lasting impression. The Camaro was offered with a range of engine options, catering to different performance appetites. The base engine was a 2.0L Turbocharged 4-cylinder producing 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Next up was a 3.6L V6 producing 335 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque. The top-tier engine was a 6.2L LT1 V8, producing 455 horsepower and 455 lb-ft of torque. The mighty ZL1 featured a supercharged 6.2L LT4 V8 producing a whopping 650 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. All of these engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission (with the ZL1 having an optional 10-speed automatic). Owners often praised the Camaro for its aggressive styling, engaging driving dynamics, and the potent power of its V8 engines. Conversely, common criticisms included limited rear visibility, a cramped rear seat, and a dated interior design.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged 4-cylinder**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.6L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6.2L LT1 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illuminated. Often accompanied by codes related to specific cylinders or the AFM system. This issue is rooted in the design of the AFM system, where cylinders are deactivated to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected AFM lifters, often requiring cylinder head removal. Some owners opt for a complete AFM delete kit, replacing the AFM lifters with standard lifters and reprogramming the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L Supercharged LT4 V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears (e.g., 1-2, 2-3). Slipping sensation during acceleration. Hesitation or delay when shifting.
    *   Solution: A software update (reprogramming the transmission control module, or TCM) may resolve the issue. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for software update), $1,000 - $2,500+ (for valve body replacement), $4,000 - $7,000+ (for transmission replacement)

**Summary**

The 2023 Chevrolet Camaro, while a performance-oriented vehicle, does have some potential issues to be aware of. The most significant concern revolves around the 6.2L LT1 V8's AFM lifter failure and the 8-speed automatic transmission's shifting problems. The AFM issue can be quite costly to address, potentially running several thousand dollars. While not universally experienced, these are points to consider when evaluating a used 2023 Camaro. Other issues like infotainment glitches and MRC failures (on equipped models) are less severe but can still be irritating.
