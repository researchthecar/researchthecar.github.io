The 2020 Chevrolet Camaro is a performance vehicle that appeals to enthusiasts for its sharp handling, powerful engine options, and aggressive styling. It's available in various trims, from the entry-level LS to the track-focused ZL1. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 producing 275 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 producing 335 hp and 284 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L LT1 V8 producing 455 hp and 455 lb-ft of torque, and a supercharged 6.2L LT4 V8 producing 650 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, an 8-speed automatic, and a 10-speed automatic (depending on the engine). While many owners appreciate the Camaro's performance and sporty nature, some common dislikes include limited rear visibility, a cramped rear seat, and some perceived quality issues in the interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **P0171 System Too Lean (Bank 1)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, rough idle, decreased fuel economy, potential hesitation or stalling. This can be caused by a vacuum leak in the PCV system, a faulty mass airflow sensor, a clogged fuel filter, or a failing oxygen sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause and replace the faulty component. A smoke test can help locate vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warnings, needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blueish smoke from the exhaust. This can be due to worn valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: Valve stem seal replacement or potentially engine rebuild in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L LT1 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, misfires, loud ticking or knocking noise from the engine, reduced power. AFM lifters can fail, causing damage to the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replace all AFM lifters and camshaft. Consider a full AFM delete kit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warnings, needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blueish smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Piston ring replacement or PCV valve replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000-$2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L LT4 Supercharged V8**

*   **Supercharger Intercooler Brick Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, check engine light, overheating. The intercooler bricks within the supercharger can crack, leading to coolant leaks into the intake.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger intercooler bricks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L45)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifts, shuddering during gear changes, hesitation when accelerating, and potential "shift flare" where the RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in speed. These issues were reported when the transmission was cold, but seemed to be related to the torque converter lock-up clutch and improper fluid.
    *   Solution: Triple flush the transmission fluid with Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP. In some cases, a transmission replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic (10L80/10L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 8-speed issues, the 10-speed can exhibit harsh shifts, particularly at lower speeds. This can be caused by valve body issues or the torque converter lockup.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission flush with the correct fluid. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes and reboots randomly.
    *   Solution: Try updating the software. If the issue persists, the infotainment module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days of not being driven. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the parasitic draw and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Tail Light Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the tail light housings. This does not usually affect functionality but is a cosmetic concern.
    *   Solution: Replacement of tail light assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Bolster Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and tear on the seat bolsters, especially on the driver's side, even with low mileage.
    *   Solution: Seat cover, reupholstering, or seat replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Rattling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises coming from the sunroof/moonroof assembly, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the sunroof tracks and seals. In some cases, the sunroof assembly may need to be adjusted or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2020 Chevrolet Camaro, while a desirable performance car, exhibits several potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the AFM system on the V8 and potential oil consumption across multiple engines, can be costly. Transmission issues, especially with the 8-speed and 10-speed automatics, are a common complaint. Electrical problems and interior annoyances, while less severe, can still be frustrating for owners. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect any used Camaro before purchase.
