### Summary Verdict

The 2.0L Turbo engine, while offering good performance, has seen some reports of turbo lag and minor oil leaks, which are typically manageable with proper maintenance and occasional repairs. Automatic transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, have been noted but are not universally reported. Electrical gremlins, primarily concerning the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are the most common non-wear-related concerns. Overall, the Camaro is a reliable choice for a sports car, but prospective buyers should be aware of these specific potential issues and factor in potential repair costs, especially for the turbocharged engine and automatic transmission.
