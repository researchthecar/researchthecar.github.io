The 2002 Chevrolet Camaro represents the final year of the fourth generation, a popular choice for those seeking affordable performance and a classic muscle car feel. Engine options include the standard 3.8L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, and the more desirable 5.7L LS1 V8, which delivers 310 horsepower and 340 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices are a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Camaro's aggressive styling, potent V8 performance (when equipped), and relative affordability. Common criticisms include the dated interior, limited rear passenger space, and sometimes challenging handling characteristics.
