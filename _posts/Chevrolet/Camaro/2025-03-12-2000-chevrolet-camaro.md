The 2000 Chevrolet Camaro represents the final year of the fourth generation and offered a blend of performance and affordability that appealed to many enthusiasts. Engine options included the 3.8L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, the 5.7L LS1 V8 producing 310 horsepower and 340 lb-ft of torque in the base model, and up to 320 horsepower in the SS model. Transmission choices were a 4-speed automatic (4L60E) or a 5-speed manual (Borg-Warner T5 for the V6, Borg-Warner T56 for the V8). Owners often appreciated the Camaro's powerful engines, aggressive styling, and relative value, while common complaints centered around interior quality, some reliability issues, and outdated design compared to newer sports cars.
