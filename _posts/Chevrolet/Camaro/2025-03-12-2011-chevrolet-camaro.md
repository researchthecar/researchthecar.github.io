The 2011 Chevrolet Camaro marked the second year of the fifth-generation revival of the iconic muscle car. It was available with three engine options: a 3.6L V6 producing 312 hp and 278 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L LS3 V8 (manual transmission) making 426 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.2L L99 V8 (automatic transmission) producing 400 hp and 410 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Camaro's aggressive styling and strong performance. Common complaints include limited visibility, a large turning radius, and some interior material quality issues.

**Summary**

The 2011 Chevrolet Camaro, while a stylish and performance-oriented vehicle, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The V6 engine is prone to timing chain issues, and the automatic transmission can experience torque converter problems. The V8 with AFM is prone to lifter failures. Electrical issues and suspension concerns like spring sag also appear. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix (sun visors), others can be costly (engine or transmission repairs). These issues are moderately concerning and require potential buyers to carefully inspect the car and review its maintenance history.
