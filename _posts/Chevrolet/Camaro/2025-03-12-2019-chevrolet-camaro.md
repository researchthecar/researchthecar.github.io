The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro is a popular sports car known for its aggressive styling and performance. Engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 275 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 producing 335 hp and 284 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L LT1 V8 producing 455 hp and 455 lb-ft of torque, and a supercharged 6.2L LT4 V8 producing 650 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque found in the ZL1. Transmission choices varied depending on the engine, with options including a 6-speed manual, an 8-speed automatic, and a 10-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Camaro's handling and powerful engine options, especially the V8s, but some dislike the limited visibility and smaller rear seats.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **No Issues Found**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Fuel Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected fuel consumption, even during normal driving conditions.
    *   Solution: There is no definitive fix for this issue. The best course of action is to ensure the car is properly maintained, with regular oil changes, tune-ups, and tire inflations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Unknown
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L LT1 V8**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning AFM lifters can cause a ticking noise, misfires, and potentially significant engine damage. This issue is most prominent in earlier production LT1 engines but can still occur.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters. Some owners opt for AFM delete kits to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on engine damage and shop rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, especially during high-performance driving.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels closely and consider using a higher viscosity oil. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L LT4 Supercharged V8**

*   **Supercharger Brick Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler bricks within the supercharger can crack, leaking coolant into the engine. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intercooler brick(s). Upgraded aftermarket bricks are available that address the design flaw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L45, 8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported harsh shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, and hesitation during acceleration. This can feel like a "bump" or "jolt" during shifts.
    *   Solution: A software update and transmission fluid change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially at lower speeds and during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change with an updated fluid formulation (often Dexron HP). In severe cases, torque converter replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (fluid change), $1,000 - $2,500+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic (10L80, 10L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 8-speed, some owners experience harsh shifting, especially at lower speeds. Hesitation during acceleration is also a common complaint.
    *   Solution:  Software update, transmission fluid change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clunking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clunking noises, especially when shifting between Park and Drive or Reverse.
    *   Solution:  In some cases, this is considered "normal" for the transmission. However, excessive clunking may require further diagnosis and potential component replacement (valve body, etc.)
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 Diagnostic Fee, $1,000 - $3,000+ for major repairs
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **MRC (Magnetic Ride Control) Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Magnetic Ride Control shocks can fail, resulting in a loss of damping and a noticeably degraded ride quality. Error messages may also appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty MRC shock(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per shock (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Glitches, freezing, and connectivity problems with the MyLink infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the system, or replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update if available) to $500 - $1,500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing parasitic draw, replacing the battery, or ensuring all accessories are turned off when the vehicle is not in use.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (battery replacement), $100+ (diagnostics for parasitic draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro offers a range of engines and transmissions, each with its own potential issues. While the 2.0L turbo engine appears to be relatively trouble-free, the V6 and V8 engines can suffer from oil consumption and, in the case of the LT1, AFM lifter failure and, in the case of the LT4, supercharger brick failure. Both the 8-speed and 10-speed automatic transmissions have been reported to experience harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also a concern. Potential MRC failures can also be costly. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2019 Camaro.
