Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2016 Chevrolet Camaro, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options.

The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro marked the sixth generation of this iconic muscle car. It was offered with a range of engines, including a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 producing 275 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 generating 335 hp and 284 lb-ft of torque, and a powerful 6.2L V8 producing 455 hp and 455 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual, an 8-speed automatic, and (later) a 10-speed automatic (depending on engine and trim). Many owners appreciated the Camaro's sporty handling, aggressive styling, and available power. However, some common complaints centered around limited rear visibility, a cramped back seat (practically non-existent), and some reported issues with specific components.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Turbocharger Noise/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or whistling noise from the turbocharger, reduced power, possible check engine light. In some cases, the turbocharger fails completely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. Diagnosis and repair of any related oil leaks or vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, engine misfires, check engine light with codes related to camshaft timing. This issue is often related to oil changes being neglected over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. It is also recommended to inspect and replace any worn camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, particularly at idle or low speeds. Engine misfires, rough running, and a check engine light. Often results in camshaft damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L45 / 8L90)**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, and sometimes when downshifting. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop. A "juddering" or vibration felt at low speeds or when the transmission is lugging. This issue is more prevalent in earlier versions of the 8L45 and 8L90.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with multiple transmission flushes using the updated Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid (blue label). In more severe cases, replacement of the valve body or even the entire transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (flush), $1000 - $2500+ (valve body), $4000 - $7000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Damper Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, particularly over bumps. Reduced ride quality and handling performance. Error messages on the dashboard related to the MRC system.

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro offers a thrilling driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 2.0L Turbo and the 6.2L V8 (AFM lifter failure), can be costly to repair. The 8-speed automatic transmission has also been a source of complaints, though fluid flushes may alleviate some issues. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and battery drain are also possible. The severity and cost of these issues vary, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection and knowledge of the car's history essential. While the Camaro is stylish and fun to drive, these issues should be considered before making a purchase.
