The 2001 Chevrolet Camaro is a rear-wheel-drive sports car that continues the fourth generation (F-body) run. Engine options included a 3.8L V6 (200 horsepower, 225 lb-ft of torque) and two versions of the 5.7L LS1 V8 (310 horsepower, 340 lb-ft of torque in the base SS, and 325 horsepower in the Z28). Transmission choices consisted of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. People generally liked the Camaro for its powerful V8 options (especially the LS1), aggressive styling, and relatively affordable price. Common dislikes included the interior quality, dated design, and sometimes difficult handling characteristics.
