### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet Camaro, particularly with its V8 engine options, is a desirable performance car. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks on the V6 and oil cooler line leaks on the V8. Automatic transmission concerns, especially with the 4L60-E, like torque converter and clutch pack failures, are notable. Suspension components can wear over time, leading to noises and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and instrument cluster, can also arise. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most frequent reliability concerns for this model year, beyond standard maintenance.
