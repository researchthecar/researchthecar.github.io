The 2021 Chevrolet Camaro represents the sixth generation of this iconic American muscle car, offering a blend of performance and style. Engine options range from a turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 to the potent supercharged 6.2L LT4 V8 found in the ZL1. Other engine options include a 3.6L V6, and a 6.2L LT1 V8. Transmission choices include a 6-speed manual, an 8-speed automatic, and a 10-speed automatic (depending on the engine). People often praise the Camaro for its aggressive styling, powerful engine options, and relatively affordable price point. Common complaints include limited rear visibility, a small back seat, and some interior materials that don't match the vehicle's sporty character.

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Camaro exhibits a range of potential issues, varying in severity and cost. Engine problems, such as oil consumption in the 2.0L turbo and AFM lifter failure in the 6.2L V8, can be expensive to address. Transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting, are common across both the 8-speed and 10-speed automatics. Electrical gremlins and sunroof malfunctions are other areas to be aware of. While some issues may be minor inconveniences, others could lead to substantial repair bills. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider obtaining a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
