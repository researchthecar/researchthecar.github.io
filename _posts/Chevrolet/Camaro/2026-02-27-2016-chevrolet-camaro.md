### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Chevrolet Camaro is a generally reliable sports coupe, particularly for models equipped with the V6 or V8 engines. The 2.0L Turbo engine, while offering good efficiency, has had some reports of turbo lag and early oil consumption issues that were mostly resolved through software or minor component updates. Automatic transmission models, especially the 8-speed, can occasionally exhibit harsh shifting, often rectifiable with fluid changes and software updates. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system, are the most common non-mechanical complaints. Overall, the sixth-generation Camaro proved to be a solid performer with a good reliability record for its class, especially when properly maintained.
