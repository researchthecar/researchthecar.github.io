The 2024 Chevrolet Camaro marks the end of an era as the final production year for this iconic muscle car. Available in coupe and convertible body styles, the Camaro offers a range of powerful engines. The engine options include a 3.6L V6 (335 hp and 284 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L LT1 V8 (455 hp and 455 lb-ft of torque), and a supercharged 6.2L LT4 V8 (650 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque) found in the ZL1. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (standard on some V6 and V8 models) and an 8-speed automatic (available on V6 and V8 models) or a 10-speed automatic (available on the V8 models). Owners often praise the Camaro for its aggressive styling, impressive handling, and potent engine options. Common complaints include limited rear visibility, a cramped rear seat (in coupe models), and some interior materials that don't quite match the car's sporty character.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

* **No Issues Found**

**6.2L LT1 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, and potential engine damage. This occurs when the AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, causes lifter failure due to their design.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often along with the camshaft and other related components. Some owners opt to disable the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L LT4 Supercharged V8**

*   **Supercharger Intercooler Brick Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of coolant, reduced supercharger performance, potential for engine overheating and damage if coolant enters the engine. The intercooler bricks within the supercharger can develop leaks due to pressure and temperature cycling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intercooler brick(s) within the supercharger. This often requires removing the supercharger from the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L45/8L90)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Harsh Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting, hard or clunky shifts, particularly between certain gears, and a general lack of smoothness.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush using the updated Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid, software update to transmission control module (TCM), or in some cases, valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic (10L80/10L90)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Harsh Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting, hard or clunky shifts, particularly between certain gears, and a general lack of smoothness.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush using the updated Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid, software update to transmission control module (TCM), or in some cases, valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (If Equipped) Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, diminished handling, fluid leaks from the dampers, and error messages on the dashboard. The Magnetic Ride Control dampers can fail due to internal seal degradation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed Magnetic Ride Control damper(s). This is generally recommended to be done in pairs (front or rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, restarts unexpectedly, or displays error messages. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software update to the infotainment system. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+ (depending on warranty coverage and the severity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a few days of being parked, difficulty starting the car, and error messages related to low voltage. This is often caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component that is not shutting down properly.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This can involve testing various electrical components and circuits to isolate the faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

**Summary**

The 2024 Chevrolet Camaro, while a desirable sports car, can experience several issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine, specifically the AFM lifter failure in the 6.2L LT1 V8 and intercooler leaks in the LT4 Supercharged V8, which can be costly to repair. The 8 and 10-speed automatic transmissions can suffer from rough shifting and engagement problems, which may require expensive repairs to the valve body. The Magnetic Ride Control system, if equipped, can also experience damper failures. While other issues exist, these are the most common. It's essential to have any potential Camaro thoroughly inspected before purchase and to be aware of these potential maintenance costs.
