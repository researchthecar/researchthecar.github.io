The 2007 Chevrolet Kodiak C4500 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications, offering robust capabilities and a durable chassis. It was commonly used for towing, hauling, and utility purposes. Engine options include the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8, the 8.1L Vortec gasoline V8, and the CAT C7 diesel. Transmission options were primarily Allison automatics. The Duramax produced around 330 hp and 620 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the Kodiak's towing capacity and workhorse reliability but dislike its size and fuel economy.
