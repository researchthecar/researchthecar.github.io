The 2008 Chevrolet Kodiak C4500 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial use, often utilized for hauling, towing, and various work applications. Engine options included the 6.6L Duramax Diesel (LBZ) and the 8.1L Vortec gasoline engine. The Duramax LBZ produced around 330 horsepower and 620 lb-ft of torque. The Allison 1000 automatic transmission was a common pairing.

**Summary**

The 2008 Chevrolet Kodiak C4500, particularly with the Duramax diesel, can be prone to issues related to fuel system components (injectors, fuel filter housing) and turbocharger. Suspension and electrical problems, common in work trucks, are also noted. Interior HVAC issues are relatively minor. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for smaller fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. While reliable when properly maintained, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor potential repair costs into their purchasing decision.
