**Introduction**

The 2004 Chevrolet C4500 Kodiak is a heavy-duty pickup truck powered by a Vortec 8100 V8 engine that produces 320 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. The truck is paired with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed Allison automatic transmission. It is known for its robust construction, impressive towing and payload capabilities, and comfortable interior. However, like any vehicle, it does have some reported issues.

**Engine**

**Vortec 8100 V8 Engine**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Symptoms may include coolant leaks, overheating, and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the gasket, which can cost around $100-$200 for the part plus labor costs.
* **Cracked Exhaust Manifold:** May cause a loud exhaust noise. Replacing the exhaust manifold can cost around $300-$600 for the part and labor.
* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Symptoms may include engine misfires, rough running, and a loss of fuel economy. Replacing fuel injectors can cost around $100-$200 per injector, plus labor.
* **Oil Leak from Oil Pan:** Leaking oil can damage other engine components if not addressed. Replacing the oil pan gasket or seal can cost around $100-$200 for the part and labor.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Grinding or Difficulty Shifting Gears:** This can be caused by worn synchronizers or clutch components. Repairing or replacing the transmission can cost around $1,000-$2,000.
* **Leaking Transmission Fluid:** Symptoms may include a lack of fluid on the dipstick and difficulty shifting gears. Replacing the leaking component, such as a seal or gasket, can cost around $100-$300 for the part and labor.

**5-Speed Allison Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh Shifting or Slipping:** May be caused by worn gears or faulty internal components. Repairing or rebuilding the transmission can cost around $1,500-$3,000.
* **TCC Solenoid Failure:** Symptoms may include transmission shuddering or slipping. Replacing the solenoid can cost around $200-$300 for the part and labor.

**Suspension**

* **Front Coil Spring Failure:** Symptoms may include a sagging front end, poor ride quality, and uneven tire wear. Replacing coil springs can cost around $200-$400 per spring, plus labor.
* **Rear Leaf Spring Failure:** May cause the rear end of the truck to sag, leading to poor handling and uneven tire wear. Replacing leaf springs can cost around $300-$500 per spring, plus labor.
* **Shock Absorber Failure:** Worn shocks can lead to poor ride quality and reduced handling ability. Replacing shock absorbers can cost around $100-$200 per shock, plus labor.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge:** Symptoms may include difficulty starting the vehicle or electrical components failing. The solution is to identify and repair any parasitic electrical drain, which can cost around $100-$300 for labor.
* **Alternator Failure:** A failing alternator may not provide enough power to the battery. Replacing the alternator can cost around $300-$500 for the part and labor.
* **Starter Failure:** Symptoms may include the engine not starting or a grinding noise when attempting to start. Replacing the starter can cost around $200-$400 for the part and labor.

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Undercarriage:** Symptoms may include visible rust and corrosion on metal components, particularly in areas exposed to moisture and road salt. Anti-rust treatment and repairs can cost around $500-$1,000.
* **Dented or Scratched Body Panels:** This can occur from accidents or general wear and tear. Repairing or replacing body panels can cost around $500-$2,000, depending on the extent of the damage.
* **Door Lock Failure:** Symptoms may include difficulty locking or unlocking the doors. Replacing door lock actuators or other components can cost around $100-$300 per door, plus labor.
