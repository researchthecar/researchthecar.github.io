The 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.6L L8T V8 gasoline engine producing 401 horsepower and 464 lb-ft of torque and the 6.6L L5P Duramax turbodiesel V8 producing 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an Allison 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the truck's powerful engine options, towing capacity, and comfortable interior (depending on the trim level). Common complaints often revolve around the infotainment system glitches, sensor failures, and the overall ride quality, which can be stiff.

**Engine**

**6.6L L8T V8 Gasoline**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) / Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light. Can be caused by sticking lifters, collapsing lifters, or worn camshaft lobes. Primarily affects cylinders that deactivate during AFM/DFM operation.
    *   Solution: Replace all lifters with updated, non-AFM/DFM lifters, and replace the camshaft if needed. Disable AFM/DFM via aftermarket tuning is also common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leak noise, reduced fuel economy, smell of exhaust in the cabin, check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts. In some cases, the exhaust manifold may need to be replaced as well.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.6L L5P Duramax Turbodiesel**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, no-start condition, metallic debris in the fuel system. The CP4 pump is known to be less tolerant of contaminated fuel compared to previous Duramax fuel pumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 pump, fuel injectors, fuel rails, and thoroughly clean the fuel tank and lines to remove debris. Some owners opt for a CP3 conversion kit for increased reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $9,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, DEF level sensor malfunction, "Service DEF System" message. Issues can stem from DEF fluid quality, sensor failures, or a faulty DEF injector.
    *   Solution: Drain and replace DEF fluid with fresh fluid meeting GM specifications. Replace faulty sensors or DEF injector as needed. Perform a diagnostic test to pinpoint the exact fault code.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 10-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or harsh shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or during downshifts. Can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Software reflash of the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may improve shifting. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reflash) to $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibration or shudder felt at highway speeds, particularly under light load or during torque converter lockup.
    *   Solution: A fluid change with updated Mobil Delvac Synthetic ATF may resolve the issue. In some cases, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the leaf spring bushings with a silicone-based lubricant. In some cases, the leaf spring bushings may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ride Quality (Stiff)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh and uncomfortable ride, especially when the truck is unloaded.
    *   Solution: This is inherent to the heavy-duty nature of the vehicle and its suspension. Some owners consider aftermarket suspension upgrades, such as air springs or softer shocks, to improve ride quality. However, this may impact payload capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Glitching**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or exhibits glitches such as delayed responses or incorrect information.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released to address these issues. A hard reset of the system may also temporarily resolve the problem. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,200+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction of driver-assistance features, such as blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, or parking sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is malfunctioning and replace it. Check wiring and connections for damage or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Bed Bounce/Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable vibration or shaking of the bed, particularly when driving on rough roads or at highway speeds.
    *   Solution: This is a known characteristic of some heavy-duty trucks with long beds. There is no definitive fix, but some owners have reported success with adding weight to the bed or using aftermarket bed stabilizers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Tailgate Assist Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dampened tailgate assist stops working, causing the tailgate to drop quickly when opened.
    *   Solution: Replace the tailgate assist strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters not working properly, overheating, or failing to heat at all.
    *   Solution: Check the seat heater wiring and connections for damage. Replace the seat heater element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD has several common issues, ranging from relatively minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Engine issues, particularly AFM/DFM lifter failure on the gasoline engine and CP4 pump failure on the diesel, can be quite costly to address.
