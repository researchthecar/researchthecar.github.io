The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. It was available with two engine options: a 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 producing 397 horsepower and 765 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel engine was available with a heavy-duty 6-speed Allison automatic transmission. Owners often praise the truck's ruggedness and towing capacity but sometimes complain about fuel economy and ride quality.
