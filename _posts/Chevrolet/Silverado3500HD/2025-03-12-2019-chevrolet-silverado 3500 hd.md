The 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck designed for serious towing and hauling. Engine options include a 6.0L Vortec V8 gas engine producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 engine producing 445 horsepower and 910 lb-ft of torque. The 6.0L gas engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission while the 6.6L Duramax is paired with an Allison 1000 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Silverado 3500 HD for its strong towing capacity, powerful engine options (especially the Duramax diesel), and comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck. Common dislikes include the dated interior design (particularly in comparison to newer trucks), some concerns about reliability, and the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 Gas**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to premature engine wear and potential damage.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic can perform an oil consumption test to determine the cause. Possible fixes include replacing valve seals, piston rings, or the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and extent of the damage.

**6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (L5P)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced fuel injector failures, leading to rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per injector, depending on labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 high-pressure fuel pump, used on this generation of Duramax, has been known to fail. When this happens, metal shavings can spread throughout the fuel system, causing extensive damage. Symptoms include rough running, stalling, no start, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 fuel pump and potentially the entire fuel system, including injectors, fuel lines, and the fuel tank. A CP3 conversion kit is a more reliable long-term solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $10,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether a CP3 conversion is performed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.6L Duramax)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, vibration, or erratic shifting, especially at lower speeds or under light load.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter, flush the transmission fluid, and potentially replace the transmission filter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially when loaded, rough ride, and potential clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs may be a good option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side, depending on the brand and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a few days, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the parasitic draw causing the battery drain. Common culprits include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, and wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common sensors that fail are the mass airflow sensor, O2 sensor, and knock sensor. Symptoms include check engine light, poor fuel economy, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on the type of sensor and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Bed Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the inside or outside of the bed, especially in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the rusted panels. Applying a bed liner can help prevent future rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight and heat.
    * Solution: Replace the dashboard or install a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ for replacement, $50 - $200 for a cover.
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or failing to respond to inputs.
    * Solution: Check for software updates, reset the system, or replace the infotainment unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) to $1,000+ for replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD, while a capable work truck, has some potential issues to be aware of. The Duramax diesel engine is powerful but can be prone to costly CP4 fuel pump failures. Both the gas and diesel engines can experience oil consumption. Transmission issues such as torque converter shudder can also arise. Electrical problems and interior cracks are other concerns. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly. Potential buyers should have a thorough inspection done by a qualified mechanic before purchasing a used 2019 Silverado 3500 HD, especially one equipped with the Duramax diesel engine.
