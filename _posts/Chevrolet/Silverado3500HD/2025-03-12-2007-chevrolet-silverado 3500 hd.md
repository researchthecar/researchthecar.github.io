The 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (353 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8 (330 hp, 450 lb-ft of torque), and the potent 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (360 hp, 650 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices were generally a 6-speed Allison automatic for the Duramax, and a 4-speed automatic for the gasoline engines, though the 6-speed was available for the gasoline engines as well. Owners often praise the Silverado 3500 HD for its ruggedness and workhorse capabilities. Common complaints include issues with the emissions systems on the diesel models, and some concerns about overall reliability.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust can be an indicator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial. Could be caused by worn valve seals, piston rings, or PCV valve issues. Replacing the faulty components is the fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the cause and extent of repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec V8**

* No Issues Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (LLY/LBZ)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust. Can lead to engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s) is necessary. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once, especially if the engine has high mileage.

*   **EGR System Problems (LLY)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR system (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) on the LLY Duramax engine is prone to clogging and failures. This can cause decreased performance, increased emissions, and potential engine damage. Check engine light illumination is common.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve and cooler. Some owners opt for EGR delete kits (check local regulations before considering this).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+, depending on whether cleaning or replacement is needed. EGR deletes can vary widely in cost.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the turbo, loss of power, excessive black smoke. Can be caused by bearing failure or leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the turbo and labor.

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The Duramax diesel engine, while powerful, can be prone to fuel injector and EGR system problems, leading to potentially expensive repairs. Rust, especially in areas with road salt, is also a concern. Instrument cluster problems are fairly common and can be annoying to deal with. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be costly, so a thorough inspection before purchase is recommended.
