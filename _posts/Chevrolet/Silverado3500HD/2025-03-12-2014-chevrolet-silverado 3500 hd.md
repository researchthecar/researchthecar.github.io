The 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust towing and hauling capabilities. Available engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (gas) and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8. The 6.0L gas engine produced 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. The 6.6L diesel generated 397 horsepower and 765 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Silverado 3500 HD for its powerful engine options, comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck), and capable towing capacity. Some common complaints included the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, relatively poor fuel economy (especially with the diesel), and some reported issues with the emissions systems on the diesel models.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (Gas)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, and potential engine damage. Often occurs at higher mileage. Can lead to complete engine failure if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty lifters, often recommended to replace all lifters while the engine is disassembled. Deleting the AFM system altogether is also a common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption without visible leaks, blue smoke from the exhaust, and low oil pressure.
    *   Solution: Replace valve seals, piston rings, or potentially the entire engine depending on the severity of the wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $6,000+

**6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (LML)**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
