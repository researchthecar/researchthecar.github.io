The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and towing prowess. It was offered with three engine options: a 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine (360 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque), a 6.6L Duramax V8 turbodiesel engine (445 hp and 910 lb-ft of torque), and a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) 6.0L V8. The gasoline engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel was paired with an Allison 1000 6-speed automatic transmission. The CNG engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Silverado 3500 HD for its strong towing capacity, comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck, and available technology. Common dislikes include a relatively plain interior compared to competitors, some reported issues with the infotainment system, and fuel economy (particularly with the gasoline engine).

**Body**

* **Frame Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frame is susceptible to rust in northern states. It is most commonly seen around the rear leaf spring mounts and rear cross members.
    * Solution: Prevention with undercoating before rust is prevalent. If rust is present, it can be repaired with welding new metal on or coating to prevent it from getting worse.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Bosch CP4 high-pressure fuel pump, used in the 6.6L Duramax diesel, is known for its susceptibility to failure when contaminated with water or debris in the fuel. Symptoms include hard starting, reduced power, and engine stalling. The debris from the pump contaminates the entire fuel system
    * Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump, fuel injectors, fuel rails, fuel lines, and fuel tank cleaning. A CP3 conversion kit is an aftermarket option that replaces the CP4 pump with the older CP3 pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD is a capable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The most serious and expensive concerns revolve around the 6.6L Duramax diesel engine, particularly the Bosch CP4 fuel pump failures, which can lead to significant repair costs. The 6.0L Vortec V8 engines are subject to AFM lifter issues. Transmission issues and electrical glitches, while less catastrophic, can still be a source of frustration and expense. Buyers should thoroughly inspect any potential purchase, paying close attention to engine sounds, transmission performance, and the functionality of the infotainment system, and be aware of potential rust issues with the frame.
