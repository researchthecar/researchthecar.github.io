Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 Chevrolet Suburban, categorized by component and engine/transmission configuration. The 2017 Chevrolet Suburban is a popular full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, strong towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 5.3L V8 (355 horsepower, 383 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.2L V8 (420 horsepower, 460 lb-ft of torque), both paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission for the 5.3L and an 8-speed automatic for the 6.2L, depending on the trim and configuration. People like the Suburban for its large cargo area, seating capacity, and ability to haul heavy loads. Common dislikes include its size (making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces) and relatively poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8 (L83)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illumination. Can lead to camshaft damage if not addressed promptly. Often occurs at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty lifters, potentially including the camshaft if damaged. Some owners opt to delete the AFM system altogether with aftermarket parts and tuning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of damage and whether AFM is deleted.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust (especially upon startup), and potential for engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with replacing the PCV valve or installing an oil catch can. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve), $150 - $300 (Oil Catch Can), $3,000 - $6,000+ (Piston Rings)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8 (L86)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Identical to the 5.3L V8 AFM lifter failure, with engine misfires, rough running, and potential camshaft damage.
    *   Solution: Similar to the 5.3L, replace faulty lifters, potentially including the camshaft. AFM delete is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of damage and whether AFM is deleted.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves (Direct Injection)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, decreased fuel economy, hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Intake valve cleaning (walnut blasting is a common method).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80) - Paired with 5.3L V8**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shaking or shuddering sensation, especially at lower speeds under light load.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter and fluid flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90) - Paired with 6.2L V8**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or abrupt shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. A noticeable "clunk" sound may be heard during shifts.
    *   Solution: Transmission flush using the updated Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid, valve body replacement (in some cases), or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (Fluid Flush), $800 - $1,500 (Valve Body), $3,000 - $6,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Shocks Leaking/Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, especially on uneven surfaces. Visible fluid leaks from the shock absorbers. The Service Ride Control message may appear on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected MRC shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200 per shock (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, inability to maintain proper ride height, and a "Service Ride Control" message. The air compressor may be excessively noisy or not run at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a short period, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include faulty door lock actuators, the radio, or other electronic modules not properly shutting down.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component causing the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and system crashes.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the infotainment screen, or replacement of the infotainment module.

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Suburban has some notable issues, particularly concerning the engine's Active Fuel Management system and the 8-speed transmission's shifting performance.  The AFM lifter failures can be quite costly to repair and can lead to more extensive engine damage if ignored. The 8-speed transmission issues, while often addressed with a fluid flush, can sometimes require more significant repairs.  Electrical problems and suspension issues (if equipped with MRC or air suspension) add to the potential repair costs.  Overall, while the Suburban offers a lot of utility, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
