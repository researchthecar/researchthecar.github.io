The 2019 Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size SUV appreciated for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and strong towing capability. It comes with three engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo Diesel I6 producing 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The 5.3L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2L and the 3.0L Duramax Turbo Diesel are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally like the Suburban's size and comfort, common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the transmission and some electrical components. Some people dislike its large size, which makes it difficult to park and maneuver in tight spaces, while others dislike its relatively poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

The most concerning are related to the engine's AFM/DFM system, leading to potential lifter failure and oil consumption. The 10-speed automatic transmission can also exhibit harsh shifting and clunking. Electrical problems, especially with the infotainment system, are also relatively common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing.
