**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, and potential for significant engine damage. This is caused by the AFM lifters collapsing, preventing cylinders from firing properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder heads. In severe cases, the camshaft may also need replacement.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be caused by piston ring issues or valve seal leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the source of the leak, potentially requiring piston ring replacement or valve seal replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
