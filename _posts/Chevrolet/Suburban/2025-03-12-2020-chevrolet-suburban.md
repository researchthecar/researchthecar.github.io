The 2020 Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong towing capability. It offers three engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6 producing 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The 5.3L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission in the lower trim packages and a 10-speed automatic transmission in higher trim packages, while the 6.2L and 3.0L engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Suburban's vast cargo space and passenger capacity, making it ideal for large families and road trips. However, some common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, as well as fuel economy, especially with the gasoline engines.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, check engine light, potential for significant engine damage if not addressed. The AFM/DFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but the lifters can fail, leading to these issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, potentially requiring removal of the cylinder head. In some cases, disabling the AFM/DFM system via a tune or aftermarket device can prevent future failures, though this may void the warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as the 5.3L V8 - Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, check engine light, potential for significant engine damage if not addressed. The AFM/DFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but the lifters can fail, leading to these issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, potentially requiring removal of the cylinder head. In some cases, disabling the AFM/DFM system via a tune or aftermarket device can prevent future failures, though this may void the warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, excessive exhaust smoke, check engine light. Issues with the fuel injectors can lead to these performance problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 5.3L V8)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting between gears, delayed engagement, or the transmission slipping out of gear. These issues can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid replacement may resolve minor issues. More severe problems may require valve body repair/replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic (paired with 5.3L V8, 6.2L V8, 3.0L Duramax)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or rough shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be due to valve body issues, internal component wear, or software glitches.
    *   Solution: A transmission re-learn procedure (reprogramming the transmission control module) or a software update may resolve some issues. More severe problems may require valve body replacement or internal repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (reprogramming) - $2,000+ (valve body/repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (If Equipped) - Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, loss of damping control, knocking noises, and a service suspension system message. The magnetic ride control dampers can leak fluid or fail internally.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or exhibits glitches. This can be due to software bugs or hardware failures.
    *   Solution: Performing a hard reset of the system may temporarily resolve the issue. Software updates from the dealer or replacement of the head unit may be necessary for more persistent problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days of non-use. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Locating and repairing the source of the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window moves slowly or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Heater/Cooler Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heater or cooler fails to function, or only works intermittently.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair/replacement of the heating/cooling element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2020 Chevrolet Suburban has some common issues, ranging from moderate to potentially severe. Engine problems, particularly AFM/DFM lifter failures, can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 10-speed automatic, can also be a concern. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and battery drain are also reported. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be costly and disruptive. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2020 Suburban.
