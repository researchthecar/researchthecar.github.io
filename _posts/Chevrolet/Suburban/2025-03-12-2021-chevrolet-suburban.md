The 2021 Chevrolet Suburban marked the beginning of the vehicle's twelfth generation, bringing with it a redesigned exterior and interior, as well as independent rear suspension for improved ride quality. Engine options included a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Suburban's spaciousness, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options. However, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, various electronic glitches, and occasional concerns about build quality.

    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts, hesitation between gears, or generally unpredictable shift patterns. This can be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve shifting issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fluid leak often traced to the transmission cooler lines or the transmission pan gasket. Low transmission fluid can cause shifting problems.
    * Solution: Replace leaking cooler lines or transmission pan gasket. Ensure proper fluid level after repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Ride Suspension (if equipped) Compressor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, "Service Ride Control" message, compressor not activating, or compressor running constantly.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor. Diagnose to determine if there are other leaks in the system (air struts, lines, etc.) that also need addressing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Air Ride Suspension (if equipped) Strut/Shock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Leaking air struts, sagging suspension, rough ride, "Service Ride Control" message, or knocking noises from the suspension.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty air strut or shock. Replace in pairs for even wear and performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200 per strut/shock (plus labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, screen going black, unresponsive touch screen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto problems.
    * Solution: Software updates from the dealer can often address these issues. In some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring, etc.)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning safety features, false alerts, error messages on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor and replace it. Recalibration may be required after replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle battery draining overnight or within a short period, requiring frequent jump starts.
    * Solution: Diagnose parasitic drain by testing each fuse to see which circuit is drawing the power. Common causes include a faulty relay, an aftermarket accessory installed incorrectly, or a defective module.

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Suburban can present a mix of issues, ranging from relatively minor infotainment glitches to more significant engine and transmission concerns. The AFM/DFM lifter failures on the V8 engines and the potential fuel injector issues on the diesel engine can be quite costly to repair. The 10-speed transmission issues, while sometimes resolved with software updates, can also lead to expensive repairs. Electrical problems, particularly with the infotainment system and sensor failures, are common annoyances. Suspension and exterior component malfunctions also contribute to the overall ownership experience. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can result in substantial repair bills. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider obtaining a pre-purchase inspection.
