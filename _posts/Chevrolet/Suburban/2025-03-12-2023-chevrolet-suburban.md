The 2023 Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size SUV offering ample space and powerful engine options, appealing to families and those needing robust towing capabilities. Engine choices include the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp and 383 lb-ft of torque), the 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque), and the 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (277 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Suburban's spacious interior and comfortable ride, but some dislike its large size and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illumination. Often occurs at relatively low mileage. Can lead to catastrophic engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters. In some cases, the entire bank of lifters and even the camshaft may need replacement if damage is extensive. Some owners opt to delete the AFM/DFM system entirely to prevent future issues, requiring reprogramming of the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair options chosen.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, needing to add oil between changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: If caught early, sometimes a software update can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (software update) to $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Chevrolet Suburban, while a capable and spacious SUV, can suffer from several common issues. The most serious involve the engine, particularly the AFM/DFM lifter failures and oil consumption in the V8 engines, which can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting, can also be a concern. Electrical problems, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, and issues with optional features like air ride suspension and automatic running boards, add to the potential ownership costs. While some issues are relatively minor and easily addressed, others can be quite expensive to fix. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
