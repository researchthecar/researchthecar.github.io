The 2016 Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and towing capability. It offered three engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). A six-speed automatic transmission (6L80) was standard with the 5.3L engine, while the 6.2L engine received an eight-speed automatic transmission (8L90). People like the Suburban for its passenger and cargo space, comfortable ride, and strong towing capacity. Common dislikes include its size making it difficult to park, and its fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Suburban, while generally reliable, experiences some common issues. The most prevalent are related to the Active Fuel Management system in both the 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines, leading to lifter failures and oil consumption. Transmission issues, particularly with the 8L90 paired with the 6.2L, can also be costly. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment system problems, are also reported. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some repairs being relatively inexpensive while others, such as engine or transmission replacements, can be quite substantial. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase.
