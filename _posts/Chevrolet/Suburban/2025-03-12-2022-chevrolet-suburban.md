The 2022 Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options. Engine options include a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 producing 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque, a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 delivering 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel producing 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Suburban's ample cargo space, comfortable seating, and smooth ride. Common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, fuel economy, and the complexity of the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light activation, and potential engine damage. The AFM/DFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, and the lifters associated with this system can fail.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, potentially requiring camshaft replacement as well. In some cases, disabling the AFM/DFM system is considered as a preventative measure after repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of oil consumption (e.g., worn valve seals, piston rings). Repair could involve valve seal replacement, piston ring replacement, or engine replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $7,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light, and potential engine damage due to lifter failure in the AFM/DFM system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, potential camshaft replacement, and consideration of AFM/DFM disablement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of oil consumption (e.g., worn valve seals, piston rings). Repair could involve valve seal replacement, piston ring replacement, or engine replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $7,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, reduced power, and potential check engine light activation. Fuel injectors may fail prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust. The EGR valve can become clogged or fail.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifts, delayed shifts, or hesitation during acceleration. Can be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $6,000+ (depending on the solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, particularly under light acceleration. Can also present as slipping during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. Flushing the transmission may help in some cases but is often a temporary fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Ride Suspension Problems (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, compressor failure, "service suspension" warning light, and uneven ride height. Air leaks in the air lines or struts are common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air strut(s), air compressor, or air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ per strut (depending on location and if aftermarket struts are used), $500 - $1,500 for compressor replacement.

**Summary**

The 2022 Chevrolet Suburban can suffer from several issues across its various systems. The most concerning are the engine and transmission problems, as they can lead to costly repairs. Lifter failures on both V8 engines are relatively common. The electrical system glitches, such as infotainment issues, can be frustrating but are generally less severe. Suspension issues are most prominent on vehicles equipped with the air ride or magnetic ride control systems, both of which can incur costly repair bills if they fail. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2022 Chevrolet Suburban.
