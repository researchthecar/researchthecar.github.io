The 2014 Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capabilities. It was offered with two engine options: a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, producing 320 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0L Vortec V8, producing 352 horsepower and 382 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (Hydra-Matic 6L80). People generally like the Suburban for its roominess, especially for large families and cargo, as well as its durability and towing capacity. Common dislikes include its size (making it difficult to maneuver and park) and fuel economy.
