### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Chevrolet Suburban generally exhibits good reliability, particularly with its larger 6.2L V8 engine and the 10-speed automatic transmission. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management system in the 5.3L V8, which can lead to costly internal engine repairs if not addressed. Torque converter shudder in the 6-speed automatic is another potential concern, though often resolvable with fluid changes. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted but not pervasive. For owners prioritizing a robust and spacious SUV, the Suburban remains a strong contender, but awareness of potential AFM and transmission issues is advisable for the 5.3L V8 models.
