Here's a breakdown of potential issues and complaints associated with the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV based on currently available information and patterns observed in other EV models. As a relatively new vehicle, long-term data is limited. This information should be viewed as potential concerns, and actual owner experiences may vary.

The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV is an all-electric compact SUV positioned as a more affordable entry point to the EV market. It offers a compelling blend of practicality, range, and technology. Available drivetrains include front-wheel drive with approximately 210 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque or all-wheel drive with approximately 290 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. What people often like about the Equinox EV is its accessible price point, stylish design, and the promise of a long driving range. Common dislikes include the initial availability constraints, potential for longer charging times compared to more premium EVs, and the newness of the platform meaning some software or minor build quality issues are possible.

**Electric Motor**

**Front-Wheel Drive Motor**
