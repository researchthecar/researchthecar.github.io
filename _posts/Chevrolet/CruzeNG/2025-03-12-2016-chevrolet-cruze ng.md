The 2016 Chevrolet Cruze NG (New Generation, referring to the second generation) is a compact car that offers a blend of fuel efficiency and comfort. The standard engine for the 2016 model year is a 1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4, producing around 153 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its modern styling, comfortable ride, and fuel economy. Common complaints often revolve around reliability issues with certain components, particularly related to the emissions system and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4 (LUJ/LUV)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining noise from the engine, check engine light illuminated. May be related to oil supply issues or premature wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. Ensuring proper oil changes with the correct oil type is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, whistling noise from the engine, oil leaks, check engine light (often with codes related to lean running conditions or vacuum leaks). Can be due to a cracked PCV valve diaphragm within the valve cover.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover assembly which contains the PCV valve. Updated valve cover designs are available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Water Outlet)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, low coolant level, overheating. Commonly traced to the plastic water outlet housing on the engine. The plastic becomes brittle with age and temperature cycles, causing cracks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water outlet housing with an updated design, ideally made of metal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T40)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Transmission slipping, where the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate the issue. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration at low speeds, especially under light acceleration. This can be caused by torque converter clutch wear.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change with a fluid containing a shudder-reducing additive may temporarily alleviate the problem. In severe cases, torque converter replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $1000+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Stabilizer Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the stabilizer bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the car, requiring frequent jump starts. Can be caused by parasitic drain from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic drain. This can involve checking the infotainment system, door locks, or other electrical modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, unresponsive touch screen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, random reboots.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with various sensor-related codes (e.g., O2 sensor, mass airflow sensor).
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation building up inside the headlight housing.
    * Solution: Removal and cleaning of the headlight, resealing of the headlight assembly. Replacement of the headlight assembly if cleaning and resealing does not help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Cruze NG can be a decent car, but potential buyers should be aware of potential reliability concerns. The engine and transmission have been found to have common issues. Turbocharger and PCV system failures can be expensive to address. Electrical issues, while generally less severe, can be frustrating.
