The 2001 Chevrolet S10 is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability, affordability, and simple design. Engine options included a 2.2L I4, producing around 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, a 4.3L V6 with approximately 180-190 horsepower and 245-250 lb-ft of torque, and a High Output 4.3L V6. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the S10's compact size for maneuverability and fuel efficiency, especially with the 2.2L engine. Common dislikes include the dated interior, limited cab space in regular cab models, and the potential for rust issues, especially in northern climates.

**Summary**

The 2001 Chevrolet S10, while generally reliable, does exhibit some common issues. Engine problems, particularly fuel injector issues on the 4.3L V6 and coolant leaks on the 2.2L I4, can be moderately expensive to repair. Transmission issues, like slipping, require a more significant investment. Suspension and electrical problems are generally less severe and cheaper to fix, but can still contribute to overall maintenance costs. Rust is a major concern, especially in certain regions, and can lead to expensive bodywork. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
