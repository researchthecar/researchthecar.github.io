### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet S10 is a capable compact truck with known issues primarily related to its age and design. Common problems include intake manifold gasket leaks on both engine options, and torque converter or solenoid issues with the automatic transmission. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise.
