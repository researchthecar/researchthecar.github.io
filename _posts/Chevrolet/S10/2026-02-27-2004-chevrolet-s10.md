### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet S10 is a capable compact truck with a generally decent reliability record for its age. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's gasket seals (intake and oil pan), particularly on the 4.3L V6, and potential transmission problems like slipping gears or torque converter issues, especially with the automatic. Suspension components such as ball joints and leaf springs can wear out over time, leading to noises and handling issues. Electrical problems like alternator failure are also noted. Exterior rust, especially on the frame and wheel wells, is a significant concern for trucks in rust-prone areas. Interior issues like cracked dashboards are primarily cosmetic but can be expensive to fix. Overall, while not immune to problems, many S10s remain functional with proper maintenance and timely repairs of these known weak points.
