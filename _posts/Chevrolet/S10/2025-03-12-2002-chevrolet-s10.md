The 2002 Chevrolet S10 is a compact pickup truck known for its affordability, practicality, and ease of maintenance. Engine options included a 2.2L inline-4, producing around 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.3L V6, making approximately 180-190 horsepower and 240-250 lb-ft of torque, depending on the configuration. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the S10's compact size for city driving and its utility for light-duty tasks. Common dislikes included its somewhat dated design, smaller cabin space compared to modern trucks, and potential reliability issues stemming from its age.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet S10, while a reliable workhorse in its day, now suffers from age-related issues. Engine problems, particularly with the fuel injection system on the 4.3L V6 and intake gasket leaks on the 2.2L, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60E automatic, are also common and potentially expensive. Suspension wear and rust are also concerns. While individual repair costs may seem reasonable, accumulating repairs can quickly add up. The overall severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be prepared for ongoing maintenance and repairs due to the vehicle's age.
