The 2017 Chevrolet S10, primarily sold in South America and other global markets, is a compact pickup truck appreciated for its practicality, affordability, and maneuverability. The S10 came with several engine options including a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 147 horsepower and 169 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax turbo-diesel.
