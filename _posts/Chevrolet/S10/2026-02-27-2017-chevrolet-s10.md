### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Chevrolet S10 demonstrates a generally solid reliability profile, particularly with its gasoline Ecotec engines and standard transmissions. The diesel variant, while offering more torque, has a higher propensity for specific issues like DPF and EGR problems, which are common to many modern diesel powertrains and can incur moderate repair costs. Electrical gremlins, such as intermittent power loss or battery drain, are the most frequently cited non-routine issues across the model range, though these are often repairable with focused diagnostics. Overall, for its segment and age, the S10 is a dependable choice, with most potential problems being manageable and not indicative of systemic failure.
