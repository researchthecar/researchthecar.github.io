The 2024 Chevrolet Montana is a compact pickup truck primarily sold in South America. It's based on the same platform as the Chevrolet Tracker crossover. The Montana is available with a single engine option: a 1.2-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing around 133 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Montana for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and car-like driving experience. Common criticisms include the lack of a true four-wheel-drive option, limited bed size, and some interior materials that feel budget-oriented. Since the vehicle is new and has a limited market reach, information on common issues is still emerging.

**Engine**

**1.2L Turbocharged Three-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners, primarily in online forums, have reported potentially high oil consumption within the first few thousand kilometers. The consumption is often noted to be higher than expected for a new engine, requiring more frequent top-ups.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly is crucial. If consumption is excessive (beyond what's typical for new engines), a dealer inspection to check for leaks, valve seal issues, or piston ring problems is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depending on the cause (ranging from minor leaks to internal engine damage), the repair cost can vary significantly from $100 for basic fixes to $1000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbo Lag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report noticeable turbo lag, particularly at lower RPMs. This results in a delay between pressing the accelerator and experiencing a surge in power.
    *   Solution: This is generally considered a characteristic of small displacement turbo engines. While a software remap might improve throttle response, it's not a definitive fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Remaps can cost around $300-$600 depending on the shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A few owners have noted occasional harsh or jerky shifts, particularly during low-speed maneuvers or when downshifting.
    *   Solution: First, ensure the transmission fluid level is correct. If the issue persists, a dealer visit for a software update or transmission adaptation reset might be necessary. In some cases, a transmission flush and fluid change can help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid change and software updates, $500+ for transmission rebuild or replacement if the issue is severe.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some users have experienced occasional freezing or lagging of the infotainment system, particularly when using navigation or multiple apps simultaneously.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset is often the first step. Check for software updates for the infotainment system. If the problem persists, dealer service is needed to diagnose potential hardware or software conflicts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates, $100 - $500+ for hardware replacement if necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking in Dashboard or Door Panels (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattles or squeaks emanating from the dashboard or door panels, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the exact source of the rattle is crucial. Applying felt tape or foam padding to areas where plastic components meet can help dampen vibrations. In some cases, clips or fasteners may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100 for DIY fixes, $100 - $300 for dealer service.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Chevrolet Montana, being a relatively new model, has limited data available regarding widespread issues. Potential problems identified include oil consumption, turbo lag, and infotainment system glitches. While the transmission has shown some potential issues of harsh shifting, its severity and frequency of occurrences have been low. The costs associated with these issues vary widely, from minor DIY fixes to potentially more expensive engine or transmission repairs. As the vehicle ages and more data becomes available, a clearer picture of common problems will emerge. For now, thorough pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance are essential.
