The 2000 Chevrolet B7 is a commercial bus chassis that was primarily used for school buses and shuttle buses. It was often paired with either a gasoline or diesel engine, with popular choices including the 5.7L Vortec V8 gasoline engine (around 255 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.5L Turbo Diesel V8. Transmission options typically included the Allison automatic transmissions, specifically the AT545. Owners often appreciated the B7's reliability, durability, and robust chassis for heavy-duty use. However, they sometimes faced challenges related to parts availability for specific chassis components and issues related to the heavy-duty nature of the vehicle. It is a very practical vehicle, but it can be somewhat uncomfortable and unwieldy for everyday use.

**Summary:** The 2000 Chevrolet B7 experiences common issues related to its age and heavy-duty application. Engine problems like intake manifold gasket failures (5.7L) and PMD failures/cracked heads (6.5L diesel) are prevalent and can range from moderate to severe in cost. Transmission problems with the Allison AT545 can also be costly. Suspension wear and electrical gremlins are also frequent. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in maintenance and repair costs.
