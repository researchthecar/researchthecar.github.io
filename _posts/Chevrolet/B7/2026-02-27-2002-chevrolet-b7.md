### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet B7, particularly when equipped with the gasoline V8 engines and the 4L80-E transmission, demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, with no widespread critical issues reported. However, models equipped with the Duramax diesel engine may encounter specific issues such as injector problems and glow plug failures, which are not uncommon for diesel powertrains of this era. The Allison transmission, while robust, can sometimes exhibit torque converter shudder. Suspension components, especially ball joints and leaf springs, are subject to wear due to the vehicle's intended heavy-duty use. Electrical issues like alternator failure and wiring corrosion are also potential concerns. Exterior rust can be a significant factor depending on the vehicle's operating environment. Overall, the B7 is a capable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas for inspection, especially concerning the diesel powertrain and heavy-use suspension components.
