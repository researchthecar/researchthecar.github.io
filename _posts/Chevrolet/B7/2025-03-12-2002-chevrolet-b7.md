The 2002 Chevrolet B7, more accurately known as the Chevrolet/GMC B-Series chassis, was a popular platform primarily used for school buses, shuttle buses, and other commercial applications. It offered a robust and durable design favored for its reliability and ease of maintenance. Engine options typically included the Vortec 5.7L V8 (gasoline), the Vortec 7.4L V8 (gasoline), and the Duramax 6.6L V8 (diesel), each providing varying levels of power and torque depending on the application. The transmissions were generally either a 4-speed automatic (typically the 4L80E) or a 5-speed manual. Owners generally appreciated the B-Series' utilitarian nature, robust construction, and ease of repair. However, they often cited its basic amenities, limited comfort, and dated design as drawbacks.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet B-Series chassis, while generally reliable, does have several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly with fuel injectors on the Duramax diesel and intake manifold gaskets on the Vortec engines, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L80E automatic, can also be significant. Suspension components are prone to wear and tear, particularly in heavy-duty applications. Electrical problems due to corrosion are also common. Rust is a concern, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Overall, the severity of potential issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs that could cost several thousand dollars.
