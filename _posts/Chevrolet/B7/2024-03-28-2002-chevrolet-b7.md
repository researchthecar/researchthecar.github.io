**Introduction:**

The 2002 Chevrolet B7 is a compact SUV that offered versatile seating and capable performance. It was available with two engine and transmission options: a 2.2L 4-cylinder engine paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, and a 3.8L V6 engine mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. The B7 received praise for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong V6 engine. However, it faced criticism for its cramped third row, lackluster 4-cylinder performance, and mediocre fuel economy.
