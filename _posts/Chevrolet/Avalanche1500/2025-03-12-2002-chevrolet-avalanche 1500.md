The 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche 1500 was a unique vehicle, blending the utility of a pickup truck with the passenger comfort of an SUV. It came standard with a 5.3L V8 engine producing 285 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. There were no other engine options for this model year, but it was offered with either a 2WD or 4WD drivetrain. It was known for its innovative "Convert-a-Cab" system, which allowed owners to extend the bed by folding down the rear seats and midgate. Owners often liked the Avalanche's versatility, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common dislikes included its bulky size and potentially poor fuel economy.
