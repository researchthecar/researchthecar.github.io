The 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche 1500 is a unique vehicle that combines the features of a pickup truck and an SUV. It was offered with three engine options: a 4.8L V8 (285 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (290 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque), and a high-output 5.3L V8 (320 hp, 340 lb-ft of torque) for the Z66 package. All engines were paired with a 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. People liked the Avalanche for its versatile midgate that allowed for extending the bed length and its comfortable ride. Common dislikes included its bulky size and some reliability issues.
