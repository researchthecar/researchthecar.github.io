**Introduction of the 2009 Chevrolet Optra**

The 2009 Chevrolet Optra is a compact sedan that offers a balance of practicality, affordability, and fuel efficiency. It is available with two engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-four producing 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8-liter inline-four that produces 126 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. The Optra received praise for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and economical fuel consumption. However, it was criticized for its lack of performance and unrefined interior.
