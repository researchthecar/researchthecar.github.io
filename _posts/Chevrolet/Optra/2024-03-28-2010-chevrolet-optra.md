## 2010 Chevrolet Optra

The 2010 Chevrolet Optra, also known as the Chevrolet Lacetti Premiere in other markets, is a compact sedan available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine option is a 1.4-liter four-cylinder with 103 horsepower and 95 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. A 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 107 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque is also available, paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic transmission. The top-of-the-line engine option is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine with 120 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque, paired with a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission.

The Optra was praised for its well-equipped interior, decent fuel economy, and responsive handling. However, it was criticized for its lackluster engine performance, especially with the base 1.4-liter engine, and its uninspired exterior design.
