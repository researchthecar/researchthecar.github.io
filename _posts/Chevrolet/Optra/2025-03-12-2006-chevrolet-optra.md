The 2006 Chevrolet Optra, also known as the Suzuki Forenza in some markets, was a compact car offered as a sedan and wagon. The primary engine option was a 2.0L Inline-4 DOHC engine producing around 127 horsepower and 131 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciated the Optra's affordability and spacious interior for its class, while common complaints centered on its mediocre fuel economy, unrefined engine, and overall build quality.

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Optra is prone to a variety of issues, primarily concerning the engine (sensor failures, thermostat issues), transmission (harsh shifting/slipping in the automatic, difficult shifting in the manual), suspension (bushing wear), and electrical systems (power windows, door locks). Rust is a significant concern. While individual repairs may not be excessively expensive, the frequency of these issues can lead to a relatively high overall cost of ownership. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major repairs, especially with the transmission.
