**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Optra presents a mixed bag for potential buyers. While it offered affordability and decent interior space at the time, it is now an older vehicle prone to reliability issues. Engine problems such as oxygen sensor failure and EGR valve issues are common and can lead to drivability problems. The 4-speed automatic transmission is also known to have issues, especially with harsh shifting and slippage, potentially requiring costly repairs or replacement. Suspension and electrical problems further contribute to the overall ownership cost. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage. Rust is also a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh weather.
