Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2004 Chevrolet Optra, categorized and formatted as requested. The 2004 Chevrolet Optra was a compact car offered with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing approximately 119 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. It came with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated its affordability and relatively spacious interior for a compact car. However, common complaints included lackluster performance, below-average fuel economy, and a tendency for various parts to fail prematurely.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (DOHC)**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine runs rough, idles poorly, and the check engine light illuminates. Diagnostic codes often indicate misfires on one or more cylinders. This can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. A compression test may be needed to rule out more serious internal engine issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the number of parts needing replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of coolant, overheating, and a sweet smell emanating from the engine compartment. Common leak locations include the water pump, thermostat housing, and radiator hoses.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking water pump, thermostat housing, or radiator hoses. Ensure the cooling system is properly flushed and filled.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ depending on the part needing replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the top of the engine, often dripping onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly. This could be caused by worn clutches, a faulty valve body, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnosis, such as a valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement, might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid/filter change) - $2000+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop. Stall speed may be higher than normal.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**
*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, slipping clutch, and a burning smell. This is generally caused by a worn clutch disc.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing. It is often recommended to resurface the flywheel at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in corners, and longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (for a pair, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits unevenly, clunking noises from the suspension, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per spring (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working, either intermittently or completely. This is often caused by a faulty window motor or a broken regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check Engine Light on. Diagnostic codes often indicate issues with the oxygen sensors, catalytic converter, or evaporative emissions system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific code and replace the faulty sensor or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the part needing replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Random sensor failures (e.g., crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor) can cause stalling, poor performance, and error codes.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
