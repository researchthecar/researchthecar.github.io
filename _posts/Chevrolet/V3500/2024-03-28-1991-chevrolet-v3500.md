**Introduction:**

The 1991 Chevrolet V3500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck offered with various engine and transmission options. The 7.4L V8 engine produces 230 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the 5.7L V8 and 6.6L V8. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual. The V3500 is known for its impressive towing and payload capacities, but like any vehicle, it has its share of problems.

**Engine**

**7.4L V8**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** This issue affects vehicles with intake manifolds made of plastic or composite materials. Symptoms include coolant leaks, overheating, and decreased engine performance. The solution is to replace the faulty intake manifold, which can cost around $400 - $800+.
* **Fuel injector failure:** The fuel injectors can become clogged or stuck, leading to engine misfires, rough idling, and decreased fuel economy. Replacing the fuel injectors typically costs around $200 - $400+ per injector.
* **Ignition coil failure:** The ignition coils can fail, causing engine misfires and difficulty starting. Replacing the ignition coils usually costs around $50 - $100+ per coil.

**5.7L V8**

* **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain can stretch or break, causing the engine to lose timing and potentially severe engine damage. Replacing the timing chain and related components can be expensive, costing around $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Valve lifter failure:** The valve lifters can fail, causing noisy engine operation and reduced engine performance. Replacing the valve lifters typically costs around $500 - $1,000+.

**6.6L V8**

* **No major issues found**

**Transmission**

**4-speed Automatic**

* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter can shudder or vibrate, especially during acceleration. This issue can be caused by worn or damaged components within the transmission. Repairing the torque converter can cost around $500 - $1,000+.
* **Slipping gears:** The transmission may slip out of gear or fail to engage properly. This can be caused by worn or damaged clutches or other internal components. Rebuilding or replacing the transmission can be costly, ranging from $1,500 - $3,000+.

**5-speed Manual**

* **Grinding gears:** The transmission may grind or make noise when shifting gears. This issue can be caused by worn or damaged synchronizers or other internal components. Replacing or repairing the affected parts can cost around $500 - $1,000+.
* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out or fail, causing difficulty shifting gears or slipping. Replacing the clutch and related components typically costs around $700 - $1,200+.

**Suspension**

* **Ball joint failure:** The ball joints can wear out or fail, causing loose steering, clunking noises, and reduced handling. Replacing the ball joints typically costs around $200 - $400+ per joint.
* **Leaf spring breakage:** The leaf springs can break or sag, affecting the vehicle's ride height and handling. Replacing the leaf springs can cost around $500 - $1,000+ per side.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to discharge and the vehicle to lose electrical power. Replacing the alternator typically costs around $300 - $500+.
* **Battery drain:** The battery can discharge prematurely due to a parasitic electrical draw. Identifying and repairing the source of the drain can cost around $100 - $300+.
