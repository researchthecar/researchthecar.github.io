### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Meriva presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core mechanicals are generally robust, specific issues like oil and coolant leaks on petrol engines, and turbocharger/EGR problems on the diesel variants, are noted. The automated manual transmission (Easytronic) can be a source of concern with its actuator and hydraulic systems. Suspension components like shocks and ball joints are typical wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM, can be frustrating and costly to diagnose. Rust can be an issue on older examples, and interior trim can develop annoying rattles. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspection, especially for higher-mileage vehicles.
