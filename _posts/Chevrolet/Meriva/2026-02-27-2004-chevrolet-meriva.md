### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Meriva presents a mixed reliability profile. While the petrol engines (1.6L and 1.8L Ecotec) and manual transmissions are generally robust with few reported widespread issues, the diesel engine options, particularly the 1.7L DTI, can be prone to more significant and costly repairs such as injector pump and turbocharger failures. The Easytronic automated manual transmission is also a point of concern, with potential issues related to its actuators. Suspension components like bushings and shock absorbers may require attention as part of normal wear, but premature failure is not a dominant theme. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the fuse box and window regulators, can also surface. Owners should be aware of these potential weak points, especially when considering a used model. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these issues and ensuring a more reliable ownership experience.
