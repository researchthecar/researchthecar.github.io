Engine issues such as coil pack failures and EGR valve problems are common, especially on the 1.6L petrol engine. Diesel models can experience turbocharger and injector issues. Suspension problems related to worn bushings and broken springs are also frequently reported. Electrical faults, like window regulator failures and instrument cluster problems, can occur. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs, such as replacing bushings or coil packs, are relatively inexpensive, others, like turbocharger replacement or major rust repair, can be costly. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly when considering purchasing or maintaining a 2005 Chevrolet Meriva.
