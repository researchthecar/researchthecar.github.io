### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Meriva presents a mixed reliability profile. Diesel engines, particularly the 1.9L JTDm, are prone to DPF and EGR valve issues, while the 1.7 CDTI can suffer from turbocharger and glow plug problems. Petrol engines appear more robust. Transmission-wise, manual clutches are a wear item, and the automated manual (Easytronic) can experience actuator failures. Suspension components like bushings and shock absorbers may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument clusters, are also noted. Interior issues often revolve around the A/C system and central locking. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, potential owners should be aware of these common issues, especially concerning the diesel powertrains and the automated manual transmission.
