### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet Meriva is a practical MPV with a generally average reliability record. Diesel engines, particularly the 1.9L variants, are more prone to issues like dual-mass flywheel failure and injector problems, while the 1.7L can suffer from turbocharger and EGR valve faults. Petrol engines are typically more robust, with ignition coil issues being the most common. Transmission-wise, manual clutches can wear, and the automated manual (Easytronic) system is known for potential actuator failures. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, can manifest as various intermittent faults. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior comfort features like the AC system may require attention. Overall, regular maintenance and prompt attention to common issues can help maintain the Meriva's usability.
