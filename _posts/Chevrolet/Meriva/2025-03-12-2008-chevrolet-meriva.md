The 2008 Chevrolet Meriva is a subcompact MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle), primarily sold in Europe and other markets outside of North America. The vehicle offers a practical interior and relatively small footprint, making it suitable for urban environments. Common engine options for the 2008 Meriva include a 1.4L gasoline engine, a 1.6L gasoline engine, and a 1.3L diesel engine. The 1.6L gasoline engine produces around 105 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the Meriva for its spaciousness and versatility for its size, while some criticisms involve its somewhat bland styling and the performance of the smaller engine options. It is important to note that due to regional variations, not all engine and transmission combinations were available in all markets.
