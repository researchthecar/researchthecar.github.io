### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Chevrolet Meriva presents a mixed reliability profile. While the petrol engines, particularly the 1.6L, tend to be robust, the diesel variants can encounter issues like turbocharger problems and EGR valve faults. The automated manual transmission (Easytronic) is a known weak point, with actuator failures being a common complaint. Suspension components, especially bushings, may require attention on higher-mileage examples. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures, can also occur. Exterior rust is a concern, particularly in areas prone to corrosion. Overall, the Meriva can be a practical vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability concerns and factor in potential repair costs, especially for the transmission and diesel engines.
