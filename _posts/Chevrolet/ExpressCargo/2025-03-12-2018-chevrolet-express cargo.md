The 2018 Chevrolet Express Cargo van is a full-size workhorse favored for its spacious cargo area, robust body-on-frame construction, and relatively simple mechanical design. It offers a good balance of utility and value. What people dislike about the vehicle is the outdated design and lack of modern features compared to competitors, along with mediocre fuel economy. Engine options include a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L V8 (341 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque, or 301 hp and 333 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). All are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
