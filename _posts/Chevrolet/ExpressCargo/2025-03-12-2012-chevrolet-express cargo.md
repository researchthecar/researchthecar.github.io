The 2012 Chevrolet Express Cargo Van is a full-size workhorse known for its reliability, spacious cargo area, and robust build. It was available with several engine options including a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 294 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque). It was also available with either a 4-speed automatic or 6-speed automatic transmission depending on the engine. Owners appreciate the van's simple design, ease of maintenance, and its ability to haul heavy loads. Common complaints include mediocre fuel economy, a basic interior, and handling that is typical of a large van.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common concern, often originating from the valve cover gaskets or the rear main seal. Visible oil drips under the vehicle, low oil levels, and the smell of burning oil are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets or rear main seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on the source of the leak.

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to oil consumption, piston ring failure, and lifter failure. Symptoms include excessive oil consumption, rough idling, and engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty lifters and/or disabling the AFM system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The oil pressure sensor can fail, causing inaccurate readings on the dashboard or triggering a low oil pressure warning light, even when the oil level is adequate.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty oil pressure sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$250
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L60E)**

*   **Slipping and Hard Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4L60E transmission is known to have issues with slipping between gears, hard shifting, and overall erratic behavior, especially at higher mileages. This is often due to wear on the internal clutch packs and solenoids.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn components or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,800 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Sagging Leaf Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially if the van is frequently used for heavy loads. This can lead to a reduced ride height, poor handling, and bottoming out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Chafing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wiring harness, particularly in the engine compartment, can chafe against other components due to vibration and movement. This can lead to short circuits, intermittent electrical problems, and sensor malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Inspecting the wiring harness, repairing any damaged wires, and securing the harness to prevent further chafing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Express Cargo, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues related to its age and usage. Engine issues like AFM problems in the 5.3L V8 and oil leaks across engines can be costly to repair. The 4-speed transmission can also develop issues with slipping. Suspension and electrical issues are also common but generally less expensive to address. Overall, while some issues can be significant, thorough maintenance and inspection can help mitigate many of these problems.
