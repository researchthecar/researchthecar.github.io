The 2013 Chevrolet Express Cargo van is a workhorse known for its spacious cargo area, robust build, and relatively simple design, making it a popular choice for tradespeople and businesses. Engine options include a 4.3L Vortec V6 producing 276 horsepower and 294 lb-ft of torque, a 5.3L Vortec V8 rated at 310 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 324 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions are typically a 4-speed automatic (4L60E with the 4.3L V6) or a 6-speed automatic (6L80E with the V8s). Owners often appreciate the van's reliability and ease of maintenance, while common complaints center around fuel economy, ride quality, and some component durability.
