The 2022 Chevrolet Express Cargo Van is a full-size workhorse, appreciated for its spacious interior, robust build, and traditional body-on-frame design which allows for easy customization and heavy-duty capability. However, it lags behind more modern vans in terms of fuel efficiency, technology, and ride comfort. The 2022 model offers three engine options: a 4.3L V6 producing 276 hp and 298 lb-ft of torque, a 6.6L V8 generating 401 hp and 464 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel inline-4 which produces 181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 4.3L V6 engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.6L V8 and the 2.8L Diesel engine are mated to a heavy-duty 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.8L Diesel was discontinued in 2022, but may still be found in vehicles manufactured early in the model year.

**Summary:**

The 2022 Chevrolet Express Cargo, while a popular and functional work van, exhibits a few common issues. Electrical problems such as flickering headlights can be annoying. Suspension bushing wear can cause noise and handling problems. Transmission issues, though not widely reported, are serious and expensive to repair if they occur. If the vehicle is equipped with a 2.8L Diesel, the fuel injectors should be inspected periodically. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle or have it inspected by a trusted mechanic before purchasing.
