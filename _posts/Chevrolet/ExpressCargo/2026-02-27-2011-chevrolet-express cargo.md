### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Chevrolet Express Cargo is a dependable vehicle for its intended purpose, but like many commercial vans, it can experience specific issues. The 4.3L V6 and 5.3L V8 engines have documented concerns with intake manifold gaskets and, for the 5.3L, the Active Fuel Management system. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can arise from torque converter or fluid leak problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, especially under heavy use. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, door latch problems and potential rust are points to monitor. Regular maintenance and addressing these potential issues proactively can ensure the longevity and reliability of the 2011 Express Cargo.
