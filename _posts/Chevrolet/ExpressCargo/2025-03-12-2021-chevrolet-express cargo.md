The 2021 Chevrolet Express Cargo van is a full-size workhorse known for its reliability and straightforward design. It's appreciated for its spacious cargo area, robust body-on-frame construction, and versatility. However, it is often criticized for its outdated design, poor fuel economy, and lack of modern safety features compared to newer vans on the market. Engine options include a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), a 6.6L V8 (401 hp, 464 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). The 4.3L V6 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission while the 6.6L V8 and 2.8L Duramax Diesel are paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission.
