The 2009 Chevrolet Express Cargo van is a full-size workhorse known for its reliability, spacious cargo area, and robust truck-based platform. Engine options for the 2009 model year include the 4.3L V6 (195 hp, 260 lb-ft torque), the 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 338 lb-ft torque), and the 6.0L V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft torque or 322 hp, 373 lb-ft torque depending on configuration). Transmission options consist of a 4-speed automatic transmission and a 6-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine. Owners often praise the van's durability and cargo capacity, but common complaints include fuel economy and some recurring mechanical issues.

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet Express Cargo, while generally a reliable vehicle, does exhibit some common issues. Engine problems, particularly AFM lifter failure on the 5.3L V8, and transmission issues (slipping in the 4L60E and torque converter problems in the 6L80E) can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension wear is also common, especially with the leaf springs. Electrical problems like door lock actuator failure are generally less costly to fix. Rust is a concern, especially in regions with road salt. Overall, potential buyers should inspect the vehicle carefully for these issues and budget accordingly.
