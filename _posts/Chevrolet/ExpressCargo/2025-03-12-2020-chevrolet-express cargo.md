The 2020 Chevrolet Express Cargo is a full-size van known for its robust build, utility, and straightforward design. The base engine is a 4.3L V6 producing 276 horsepower and 298 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 6.0L V8 producing 341 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque and a 2.8L Duramax Diesel. The 4.3L V6 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 6.0L V8 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate its payload capacity and simple maintenance, while common dislikes include its dated interior, fuel economy, and relatively basic features compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light. Often related to oil starvation or wear in the AFM lifters causing them to collapse.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters, and potentially the camshaft if damaged. Disable the Active Fuel Management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption (more than 1 quart every 3,000 miles), blue smoke from the exhaust, especially during startup or acceleration.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the root cause (worn piston rings, valve seals, PCV valve failure). Repair or replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and repair scope
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption (more than 1 quart every 3,000 miles), blue smoke from the exhaust, especially during startup or acceleration.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the root cause (worn piston rings, valve seals, PCV valve failure). Repair or replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and repair scope.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Diesel**

* **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, DEF system messages, DEF injector failures, or DEF quality sensor malfunctions.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific fault within the DEF system. Repair or replace faulty components such as the DEF injector, DEF pump, DEF level sensor, or NOx sensors. Software updates may also be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.0L V8)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, especially between 30-50 mph. Often felt through the seat or steering wheel.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, or replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $1,500+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 4.3L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or harsh shifts, particularly between certain gears. Slipping sensation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and software update. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal, reduced ride height, bottoming out over bumps, unusual noises from the rear suspension, visible cracks or breaks in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty leaf springs if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, especially after sitting for short periods. Difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic drain (faulty module, accessory, or wiring). Check and replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera display. Distorted image or no image at all.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair or replace the camera wiring, connectors, or the camera itself. Check for software updates for the infotainment system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component needing replacement and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary**

The 2020 Chevrolet Express Cargo, while a dependable workhorse, exhibits a range of issues common to its design and powertrain options. Engine-related problems, particularly oil consumption and AFM lifter failure on the V6, can be costly to address. Transmission issues like shuddering and harsh shifting are also prevalent and require prompt attention. Suspension concerns mainly revolve around leaf spring fatigue. Electrical glitches, especially related to the battery and backup camera, can cause inconvenience. While most issues are manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems to make an informed decision. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls.
