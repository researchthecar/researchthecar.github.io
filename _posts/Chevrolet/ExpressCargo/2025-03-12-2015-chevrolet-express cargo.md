The 2015 Chevrolet Express Cargo is a full-size van appreciated for its robust capabilities and practicality, making it a popular choice for commercial use and those needing ample cargo space. It's available with several engine options: a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 334 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (342 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options generally include a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise its straightforward design, ease of maintenance, and towing capacity. Common dislikes include its fuel economy and relatively outdated interior.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle, low oil levels, and the smell of burning oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. Clean the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system can cause lifter failure, resulting in a ticking noise from the engine, misfires, and a rough idle.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM delete kits are also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can happen due to worn piston rings or issues related to the AFM system. Signs include needing to add oil frequently between changes and blue smoke coming from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Address worn piston rings and consider disabling the AFM system. Replacing the piston rings is a labor-intensive process.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for piston ring replacement, $500-$1,500 for AFM disable

**6.0L V8**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or delayed shifts, or slip between gears. This can be caused by worn valve body components or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild, or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ for valve body, $3000 - $5000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag or break, especially if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads. This can lead to a rough ride and reduced load capacity.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per spring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Express Cargo presents a range of issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly with the 5.3L V8's AFM system and oil consumption, can be expensive to address. Transmission issues, such as torque converter shudder and harsh shifting, are also common. Suspension problems, like leaf spring sagging, can affect ride quality and load capacity. Electrical issues can be frustrating, and exterior issues with the sliding door rollers can be inconvenient. The severity and cost of these potential repairs vary significantly, so a thorough inspection before purchase is recommended.
