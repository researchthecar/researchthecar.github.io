The 2014 Chevrolet Express Cargo Van is a full-size workhorse known for its reliability, spacious interior, and towing capacity. Available engine options included a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 294 lb-ft torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 334 lb-ft torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft torque). Transmission options typically consisted of a 4-speed automatic for the V6 and a 6-speed automatic for the V8s, though some earlier V6 models may have a 3-speed. Owners appreciate the van's utility and simple design, making it easy to maintain and customize. Common criticisms include its outdated design, relatively poor fuel economy, and ride quality compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Express Cargo van, while reliable, is prone to a few common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 5.3L V8's AFM system and oil leaks across various engine options, represent some of the more costly potential repairs. Transmission issues, especially with the 6-speed automatic, can also be significant. Suspension wear and rust are also important factors to consider. While many of these issues are typical for a vehicle of this age and usage, potential buyers should be aware and factor these potential maintenance costs into their budget.
