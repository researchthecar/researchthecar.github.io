The 2017 Chevrolet Express Cargo van is a full-size workhorse known for its robust build and versatility. It's available with a range of engines, including a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L V8 (341 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). The 4.3L and 6.0L engines are generally paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.8L Diesel is usually matched with an 8-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Express Cargo's spacious cargo area and straightforward design, making it ideal for commercial use. However, some common complaints include the van's dated interior, lower fuel economy compared to more modern vans, and some reliability issues.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Visible blue smoke may be emitted from the exhaust pipe.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks promptly can help mitigate the issue. In severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EVAP Purge Solenoid Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, rough idling, difficulty starting, or stalling. The EVAP system may be unable to properly regulate fuel vapor pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty EVAP purge solenoid valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noises coming from the engine, especially when cold. Misfires, rough idling, and a decrease in fuel economy can also occur. Check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed AFM lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners opt to delete the AFM system entirely to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels. Common leak locations include valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to the DEF system, reduced engine power, and potential inability to start the engine. Problems can stem from faulty DEF injectors, sensors, or the DEF pump.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty DEF system component. Ensure the DEF fluid is of high quality and not contaminated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 4.3L V6 and 6.0L V8)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable vibration or shudder during light acceleration or cruising speeds, often around 40-60 mph. The shudder may feel like driving over rumble strips.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush/exchange or replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay when shifting gears, especially when accelerating from a stop. Shifts may also feel harsh or jerky.
    *   Solution: Start with checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush might help, but in some cases, valve body issues or internal damage could require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (Typically paired with 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh 1-2 and 2-3 shifts. Some owners have also reported a noticeable clunking noise when shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Software updates or a full transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sagging, particularly when loaded. Broken or cracked leaf springs may be visible. The ride may also become rougher and less stable.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the van is frequently used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Uneven tire wear, and loose or unstable steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints and/or control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failing Power Door Locks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks may intermittently fail to lock or unlock, or may not work at all.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty door lock actuator and replacement of the affected actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Express Cargo, while reliable for many commercial purposes, does present some common issues. Engine problems such as excessive oil consumption (4.3L) and AFM lifter failure (6.0L) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues like torque converter shudder and harsh shifting can also be a concern. Suspension problems like leaf spring sag are also fairly prevalent. Electrical issues and rust are also common and should be inspected on a used model. The severity and cost of these potential issues vary, but thorough inspection and preventative maintenance can help mitigate the risk.
