The 2010 Chevrolet Express Cargo van is a popular choice for tradespeople and businesses needing a reliable work vehicle. It offers a robust body-on-frame design, ample cargo space, and the option of rear-wheel or all-wheel drive. Engine options for the 2010 Express Cargo include a 4.3L V6 (195 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp and 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque). The 4.3L is paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.3L and 6.0L are paired with a 4 or 6-speed automatic transmission depending on the model and configuration. Common praises of the Express Cargo include its durability, simple design, and ease of maintenance. Criticisms often center on its dated interior, lower fuel economy compared to more modern vans, and ride quality.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2010 Chevrolet Express Cargo can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems such as AFM lifter failure and oil consumption on the 5.3L V8 can be costly to repair. Transmission issues like slipping and torque converter shudder can also be expensive. Rust is a common concern, particularly in areas with road salt. While these issues should be considered, a well-maintained Express Cargo can still provide many years of service. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs. Costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and chosen repair solution.
