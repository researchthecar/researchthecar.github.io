**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Express Cargo can be a reliable work van, but prospective buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems, especially those related to AFM in the 4.3L V6 and oil consumption in the 6.0L V8, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting and torque converter shudder, are also prevalent. Suspension and electrical issues, while generally less expensive to fix, can still be inconvenient. Addressing these potential problems proactively through regular maintenance can help extend the life of the vehicle.
