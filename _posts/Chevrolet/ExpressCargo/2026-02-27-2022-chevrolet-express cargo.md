### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Chevrolet Express Cargo van demonstrates a generally robust mechanical foundation, particularly with its powertrain options. Common issues tend to be related to wear items that can be exacerbated by heavy use, such as suspension components (ball joints, leaf springs) and potential leaks in the engine (coolant, oil). Electrical system concerns like alternator failure and wiring issues are also noted. For the diesel engine, fuel system components like injectors and the EGR system require attention. While interior and exterior components can experience failures, they are less frequently reported as widespread problems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to maintaining the reliability of the Express Cargo.
