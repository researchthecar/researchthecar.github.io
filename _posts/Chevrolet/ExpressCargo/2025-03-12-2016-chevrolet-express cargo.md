The 2016 Chevrolet Express Cargo Van is a full-size work van known for its reliability, spacious interior, and payload capacity. It's a popular choice for tradespeople and businesses needing a dependable vehicle for hauling cargo and equipment. Available engine options include the 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), the 6.0L V8 (342 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), and the 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options consist of a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the van's straightforward design, ease of maintenance, and robust build. Common dislikes include its dated styling, fuel economy, and basic interior features.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the oil pan gasket, valve cover gaskets, and rear main seal. This can result in oil consumption and potentially damage engine components if not addressed. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. A mechanic will need to inspect and pinpoint the exact location of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 6.0L V8 engines equipped with Active Fuel Management (AFM) or Cylinder Deactivation, which shuts off cylinders during light load conditions to improve fuel economy, can experience premature lifter failure. This can lead to engine misfires, rough running, and in severe cases, damage to the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system entirely to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system, including the DEF pump, DEF injector, or sensors, can trigger warning lights and potentially limit vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty component, such as the DEF pump, injector, or sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibrating sensation, particularly at lower speeds or during light acceleration, may indicate torque converter problems.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or flushing the transmission fluid may resolve the issue. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and necessary repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs, responsible for supporting the vehicle's load, can sag or crack over time, especially if the van is frequently used for heavy hauling. This can lead to a rougher ride, reduced load capacity, and potentially affect handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn or damaged leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per side, depending on the brand and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may fail to operate properly, with the actuators becoming weak or completely failing to lock or unlock the doors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator may fail, leading to the battery not charging properly and eventually causing the vehicle to stall. Symptoms include a battery light on the dashboard, dimming headlights, and difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Roller Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door rollers can wear out or become damaged, making the door difficult to open or close smoothly. The door may bind or require excessive force to operate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn or damaged sliding door rollers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per roller, depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seatbelt Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seatbelt latch can fail, preventing the seatbelt from properly fastening or releasing. This can compromise safety in the event of an accident.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty seatbelt latch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2016 Chevrolet Express Cargo can be a reliable work vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine problems such as oil leaks and lifter failure (on the 6.0L V8) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter shudder, are another concern. Suspension problems like sagging leaf springs can impact the van's ride and load capacity. Electrical issues, such as door lock actuator and alternator failures, are also possibilities. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more severe and require significant investment. The severity and cost of these issues vary, so a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
