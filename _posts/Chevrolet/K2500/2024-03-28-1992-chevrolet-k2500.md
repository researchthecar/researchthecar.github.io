Owners appreciate the K2500's spacious cabin, impressive towing and hauling capabilities, and off-road prowess. However, some common issues have been reported with this vehicle.

**Engine**

**5.7L V8 Gasoline Engine**
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gaskets can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include overheating, rough idling, and poor performance. Repair involves replacing the gaskets and cleaning the affected areas. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500+
* **Valve cover gasket leaks:** The valve cover gaskets can wear out and start leaking oil. This can cause an oily mess under the hood and eventually lead to engine damage if left unaddressed. Repair involves replacing the gaskets and cleaning the affected areas. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $300+
* **Fuel injector issues:** The fuel injectors can become clogged or faulty, leading to poor engine performance, hesitation, and increased fuel consumption. Repair involves cleaning or replacing the affected injectors. Estimated cost to fix: $150 - $500+

**7.4L V8 Gasoline Engine**
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Similar to the 5.7L engine, the 7.4L engine can also experience intake manifold gasket failures. Symptoms and repairs are the same. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500+
* **Water pump failure:** The water pump can fail, leading to coolant leaks and overheating. Symptoms include a whining noise, low coolant levels, and increased engine temperature. Repair involves replacing the water pump and related components. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600+
* **Exhaust manifold leaks:** The exhaust manifolds can develop leaks, causing a loud exhaust noise and reduced engine performance. Repair involves replacing the affected manifold or repairing the leak if possible. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $800+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
* **TCC solenoid issues:** The torque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid can fail, leading to slipping gears, poor acceleration, and delayed shifting. Repair involves replacing the solenoid and reprogramming the transmission if necessary. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600+
* **Shift solenoid issues:** The shift solenoids control the shifting process. Faulty solenoids can cause erratic shifting, difficulty shifting into certain gears, or a complete loss of gears. Repair involves replacing the affected solenoids and reprogramming the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $800+

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
* **Synchronizer ring wear:** The synchronizer rings can wear out over time, leading to grinding noises when shifting gears. Repair involves rebuilding the transmission and replacing the affected rings. Estimated cost to fix: $1,200 - $1,800+
* **Clutch issues:** The clutch can slip or wear out, causing difficulty engaging or disengaging gears. Repair involves replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing. Estimated cost to fix: $600 - $1,000+
