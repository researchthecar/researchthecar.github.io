**The 2005 Chevrolet SSR**

The 2005 Chevrolet SSR is a retro-styled convertible pickup truck that was produced from 2003 to 2006. It was based on the Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV and was powered by a 6.0-liter V8 engine that produced 390 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. The SSR was available with either a six-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.
