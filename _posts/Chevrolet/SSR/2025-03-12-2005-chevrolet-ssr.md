The 2005 Chevrolet SSR is a unique and polarizing retro-styled pickup truck convertible. It was offered with two engine options in 2005: the standard 5.3L LS4 V8 producing 300 hp and 331 lb-ft of torque and the optional 6.0L LS2 V8 producing 390 hp and 405 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the SSR's distinctive looks and convertible top.
