The 2004 Chevrolet SSR is a unique retro-styled roadster pickup truck. For 2004, it came equipped with a 5.3L LM4 V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the SSR for its distinctive looks and convertible top. Common complaints included the limited bed space and polarizing styling. Later model years offered more powerful engines and manual transmissions, but the 2004 was limited to the aforementioned configuration.
