**Summary**

The 2000 Chevrolet Express 2500, while a reliable workhorse, is prone to age-related issues. Engine problems can range from relatively inexpensive gasket replacements to more costly injector or distributor failures. The transmissions, especially the 4L60E, can suffer from slipping and require rebuilding. Suspension components such as ball joints and leaf springs wear out over time, affecting ride quality. Electrical gremlins related to door locks, alternators, and grounding are also common. Rust is a concern in areas with harsh weather. Overall, owners should be prepared for maintenance costs associated with an older vehicle, but many issues are manageable with preventative care and timely repairs. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage.
