The 2019 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial and passenger transportation. The van offers a robust and practical design, favored for its spacious interior, payload capacity, and reliability. However, it's not without its drawbacks, with some owners citing a dated interior, poor fuel economy, and basic features compared to more modern vans. The 2019 Express 2500 comes with three engine options: a 4.3L LV1 V6 producing 276 hp and 298 lb-ft of torque, a 6.0L L96 Vortec V8 making 341 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L LWN Duramax Turbo-Diesel producing 181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. It is equipped with a 6L90 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.3L LV1 V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6.0L L96 Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, especially at idle or low speeds. Check engine light comes on with codes related to cylinder misfires (e.g., P0300, P0301-P0308). Loud ticking noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed AFM lifters. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the shop and extent of damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.8L LWN Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to the DEF system (e.g., P20EE, P204F). Reduced engine power or speed limitation. "Service Exhaust Fluid System" message displayed on the driver information center. Potential for DEF injector clogging or DEF quality sensor malfunction.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue within the DEF system. This could involve replacing the DEF injector, DEF pump, DEF quality sensor, or cleaning the DEF tank. In some cases, a software update may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, especially when the transmission is under load. Slipping between gears. Check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Flush the transmission fluid and inspect for debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission shifts roughly or abruptly. The issue is most noticeable when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear, or when downshifting.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is dirty or low, perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the van sits lower than normal. Reduced load-carrying capacity. Noises (creaking, clunking) from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Visual inspection reveals cracked or broken leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the van is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery dies overnight or after a short period of disuse. Difficulty starting the vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Express 2500, while a reliable workhorse, does have some common problem areas. Engine issues like AFM lifter failure on the 6.0L V8 and DEF system problems on the Duramax diesel can be expensive to repair. The 6L90 transmission can also suffer from torque converter issues and harsh shifting. Suspension problems like leaf spring sagging, electrical issues like battery drain, and exterior issues like sliding door roller failure, can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, but some repairs can run into the thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchasing, and be prepared to address them.
