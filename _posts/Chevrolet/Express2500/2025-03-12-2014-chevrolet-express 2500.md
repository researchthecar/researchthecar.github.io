The 2014 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a full-size cargo and passenger van known for its robust build and practicality. It offers a workhorse platform appreciated by businesses and individuals needing space and towing capacity. Engine options for this year include a 4.8L Vortec V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L Vortec V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (260 hp, 525 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Users generally like the Express for its simple, durable design and its ability to handle heavy workloads. Dislikes often include the dated interior, fuel economy, and relatively basic features compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**4.8L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, especially as mileage increases. This can manifest as needing to add oil between changes.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, inspect for leaks and consider a compression test to check for internal engine wear. In severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (top off oil) - $3,000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, check engine light illumination, and potential failure to pass emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty catalytic converter. Diagnosing the root cause of the failure (e.g., engine running rich) is recommended to prevent premature failure of the replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine features AFM, which can sometimes lead to lifter failure, causing a ticking noise, misfires, and potentially significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system to prevent future issues by replacing the lifters with non-AFM lifters, and reprogramming the computer to no longer use the AFM system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, some owners experience oil consumption, particularly as the vehicle ages.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels, check for leaks, and consider a compression test if consumption is high. Valve guide seals or piston rings may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (top off oil) - $3,000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, white smoke from exhaust, decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). Proper diagnosis is essential to identify the specific injector(s) causing the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plug(s). Sometimes, the glow plug control module can also fail.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation, particularly at lower speeds and during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: A fluid flush may temporarily alleviate the issue. A new torque converter may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $800+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears.
    *   Solution: A TCM re-programming may improve shift quality. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal wear may be present, requiring more extensive repairs or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reprogram) - $2,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, especially under load. Visible cracks or damage to the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the van is frequently used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and/or control arm bushings. A wheel alignment is recommended after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks that don't work reliably or fail completely.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as issues with the interior lights, wipers, or radio.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the BCM for faults. Reprogramming or replacement of the BCM may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially around Wheel Wells and Rocker Panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust formation in common areas.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust, repair any damage, and repaint. Preventive measures, such as rust inhibitors, are recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300+ (per area, depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard (expensive) or use a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (dashboard cover) - $1,000+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner detaching from the roof and sagging.
    *   Solution: Re-glue the headliner (temporary fix) or replace the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (glue) - $400+ (headliner replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a reliable van, but like any vehicle, it has its share of common problems. Engine issues such as oil consumption and AFM lifter failure (6.0L) can be costly to repair. Diesel models can have expensive fuel injector replacements. Transmission problems, particularly torque converter shudder, are also potential concerns. Suspension wear and tear is typical for a vehicle designed for heavy use. Electrical issues and interior imperfections add to the list. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission overhauls, can be significant investments. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used Express 2500 before purchasing.
