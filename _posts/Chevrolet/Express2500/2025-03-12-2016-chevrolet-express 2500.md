The 2016 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial and passenger applications. Engine options included a 4.8L Vortec V8 (285 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L Vortec V8 (342 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I4 (181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque) which was added later in the model year. The 6.0L V8 could be configured to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (Hydra-Matic 6L90). Owners appreciate the Express for its cargo capacity, ruggedness, and simple, easy-to-repair design. Dislikes often center on the van's age (design hasn't changed much in decades), fuel economy, and basic interior appointments.

**Engine**

**4.8L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing higher than average oil consumption in the 4.8L V8, requiring them to add oil between scheduled changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and visible blue smoke from the exhaust pipe.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potential repairs such as replacing valve stem seals or piston rings if the consumption is excessive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the cause and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system can cause lifter failure due to its deactivation of cylinders. Symptoms include a ticking noise, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially disabling the AFM system to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I4**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system, including sensor failures, clogged injectors, and pump malfunctions. Symptoms include a check engine light, reduced engine power, and warning messages related to DEF levels or quality.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing faulty DEF system components. This could include the DEF pump, sensors, or injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Hydra-Matic 6L90 (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially with heavy loads. This results in reduced ride height, poor handling, and potential breakage of the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with new or upgraded heavy-duty options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuators can fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor resistor can fail, resulting in the inability to control the fan speed for the HVAC system, or only one fan speed working.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust around wheel wells and lower body panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rust forming around the wheel wells and on the lower body panels, especially in areas where road salt is used.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Express 2500, while generally considered reliable, experiences some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the AFM system on the 6.0L and oil consumption on the 4.8L, can lead to costly repairs. The 2.8L Duramax Diesel added to the list with DEF problems. Transmission issues like harsh shifting are also a concern. Suspension, electrical, and rust problems are less severe but still noteworthy. Overall, the cost of potential repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
