The 2021 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a full-size work van known for its ruggedness and practicality. It's a popular choice for businesses and individuals who need a reliable cargo or passenger hauler. Engine options for the 2021 model include a 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.6L V8 (401 hp, 464 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Express's simplicity, robust build, and generous cargo capacity. Common dislikes include its outdated design, relatively poor fuel economy, and lack of modern safety and technology features.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6.6L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or unpredictable shifts, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. This can manifest as jolting, hesitation, or clunking sounds.
    *   Solution: A possible cause is a faulty valve body, specifically sticking valves. Flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the valve body may resolve the issue. Recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) by the dealer may also be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature sagging of the rear leaf springs, particularly when the van is regularly loaded with heavy cargo. This can lead to a reduced ride height in the rear and compromise the vehicle's handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs with upgraded, heavy-duty springs is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the battery draining overnight or over a few days of inactivity. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component that is not properly shutting off when the vehicle is off.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw. This often involves systematically disconnecting circuits and monitoring the current draw to identify the faulty component. Once identified, the offending component needs to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failing ABS Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Antilock Brake System (ABS) sensor fails more often than expected. It can cause an ABS or traction control light to illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ABS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Latch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding side door. This can stem from a misaligned latch, worn rollers, or a faulty cable mechanism.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the latch, replacing the rollers, or repairing/replacing the cable mechanism. Lubrication of the moving parts can sometimes resolve minor issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+ (depending on the cause and extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Express 2500, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. The most significant complaints relate to the transmission, with harsh shifting being a common issue potentially requiring a valve body replacement. Suspension sagging is also reported, especially when frequently carrying heavy loads, with owners opting for upgraded leaf springs. Electrical problems, such as battery drain and ABS sensor failure, are present but appear less frequent. The sliding door mechanism can also be problematic. While many issues can be addressed relatively affordably, transmission repairs can be costly. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle, especially if it has a history of heavy use.
