Owners praise the Express 2500's reliability, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. However, some issues have been reported.

**Engine**

* **4.8L V8**
    * **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** This issue affects engines produced before 2009. Symptoms include a decrease in coolant levels, rough idling, and engine overheating. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gaskets at an estimated cost of $400 - $600.
    * **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure:** This failure can result in inaccurate oil pressure readings, leading to insufficient lubrication. It can be fixed by replacing the sensor at a cost of approximately $100 - $200.
* **6.0L V8**
    * **Piston Ring Failure:** Some engines may experience premature piston ring failure, leading to excessive oil consumption and decreased power. The repair involves rebuilding the engine with new pistons and rings, costing an estimated $3,000 - $5,000.
    * **Electronic Throttle Body Failure:** This issue can cause acceleration problems or engine stalling. It requires replacing the electronic throttle body at a cost of approximately $400 - $600.
* **6.6L Duramax V8**
    * **Fuel Injector Failure:** Faulty fuel injectors can disrupt fuel flow, resulting in engine misfiring and poor fuel economy. They need to be replaced at a cost of $600 - $1,200.
    * **EGR Cooler Failure:** The EGR cooler can clog or develop leaks, affecting engine performance. The solution is to replace the cooler at an estimated cost of $1,500 - $2,000.
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** In rare cases, the turbocharger may fail, leading to a significant loss of power. Replacing it is expensive, costing around $2,500 - $3,500.

**Transmission**

* **6-speed Automatic**
    * **Torque Converter Shudder:** This issue occurs during acceleration or gear changes and can be caused by worn transmission components. It requires replacing the torque converter at an estimated cost of $800 - $1,200.
    * **Solenoid Failure:** Transmission solenoids can malfunction, leading to shifting problems and a check engine light. The repair involves replacing the faulty solenoid at a cost of $300 - $500.
* **4-speed Automatic**
    * **Transmission Slipping:** The transmission may experience slipping gears, resulting in poor acceleration and performance. This issue can be resolved by replacing the transmission at a cost of $2,000 - $3,000.

**Suspension**

* **Front Sway Bar Links Failure:** The front sway bar links can deteriorate or break, affecting handling and stability. Replacing them costs approximately $200 - $400.
* **Rear Leaf Spring Breakage:** Over time, rear leaf springs can break due to overloading or wear. The solution is to replace the leaf springs at a cost of $500 - $800.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Draining:** Some vehicles may experience excessive battery drain, caused by faulty electrical components or faulty wiring. Identifying and fixing the source of the drain can cost around $100 - $300.
* **Alternator Failure:** Alternator failure can result in complete electrical system failure or difficulty starting the vehicle. Replacing the alternator costs approximately $400 - $600.

**Exterior**

* **Rear Door Lock Failure:** The rear door locks may fail to open or close properly. This issue can be resolved by replacing the door lock actuators at a cost of $100 - $200 per door.
* **Wiper Motor Failure:** The wiper motor can malfunction, causing the wipers to operate slowly or not at all. Replacing it costs approximately $200 - $300.

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure:** In some vehicles, the air conditioning compressor may fail, resulting in a lack of cold air. Repairing or replacing the compressor can cost around $800 - $1,200.
* **Power Window Motor Failure:** The power window motors can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Replacing the motor costs approximately $150 - $250 per window.

**Summary**

The Chevrolet Express 2500 is a capable and reliable vehicle, but it is not immune to issues. The severity and cost of the reported issues vary, with some being relatively minor and inexpensive to fix while others can be more serious and costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchase decision.
