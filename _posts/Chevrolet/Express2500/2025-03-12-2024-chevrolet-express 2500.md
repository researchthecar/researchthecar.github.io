Keep in mind that as a newer model year, long-term reliability data is still emerging.

The 2024 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a full-size cargo and passenger van favored for its utilitarian nature and robust build. It is available with two engine options, the 4.3L LV1 V6 producing 276 hp and 298 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.6L L8T V8 producing 401 hp and 464 lb-ft of torque.

**Summary**

The 2024 Chevrolet Express 2500 appears to be a relatively reliable vehicle based on early reports. The most commonly cited issues involve the transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive (fluid flushes, system resets), others (valve body replacement, infotainment replacement) can be more costly. However, as a newer model year, it's important to monitor for any emerging trends as more data becomes available. The severity of issues appears to range from minor annoyances to more significant mechanical problems, so potential buyers should be aware of these possibilities and consider purchasing an extended warranty for added peace of mind.
