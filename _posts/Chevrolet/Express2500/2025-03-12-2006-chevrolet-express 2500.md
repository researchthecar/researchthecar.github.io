**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a capable van but is prone to a range of issues related to its age and mileage.

Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these potential problems and factor in repair costs when making a purchase decision. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely depending on the vehicle's condition and maintenance history.
