*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, and reduced fuel economy can indicate fuel injector problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine which injectors are failing is required, followed by replacement of the faulty injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector (plus labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, and white smoke from the exhaust during startup are common symptoms of failing glow plugs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty glow plugs and checking the glow plug control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600

**Summary**

The 2011 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a generally reliable work van, but it does have some common issues to be aware of. The excessive oil consumption and broken exhaust manifold bolts on the gasoline engines, and fuel injector and glow plug issues on the Duramax Diesel can be costly. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are prone to wear. Electrical problems such as door lock actuator and ABS sensor failures can also occur. Rust can be a significant problem, especially in areas with road salt. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas before purchasing and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major repairs costing thousands of dollars.
