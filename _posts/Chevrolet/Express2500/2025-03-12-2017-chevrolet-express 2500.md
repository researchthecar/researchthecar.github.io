The vehicle is popular for its large cargo capacity, versatility, and relatively simple design, which makes it appealing to businesses and individuals needing a dependable work vehicle. Some owners appreciate its straightforward mechanics and ease of repair, while others dislike its dated design, fuel economy, and ride comfort compared to newer vans. The 2017 Chevrolet Express 2500 offered multiple engine options. The base engine was a 4.3L V6 with 276 horsepower and 298 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 6.0L V8 produced 341 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque. Additionally, a 2.8L Duramax Diesel inline-4 was available, making 181 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. These engines were typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is the typical solution. The specific repair depends on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) System Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with AFM, it may experience oil consumption issues, misfires, and rough idling. This is due to the system's tendency to cause carbon buildup on the cylinders that are deactivated.
    *   Solution: Disabling the AFM system is a common solution. Mechanical repairs include replacing lifters or valve springs damaged by the AFM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold bolts are prone to breaking, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts is the fix. In some cases, the manifold may need to be replaced if it's warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the DEF system, including sensor failures and pump malfunctions, can cause error messages, reduced engine power, and potential engine shutdown.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty components within the DEF system are necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration can occur at low speeds, particularly when the torque converter is locking up. This is often caused by deteriorated transmission fluid or a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush, along with adding a shudder fix additive can resolve the issue in some cases. Replacing the torque converter may be necessary if the shudder persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially if the van is frequently used for heavy loads. This results in a reduced ride height, poor ride quality, and potential handling issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs is the most effective solution. Adding helper springs or air bags can provide additional support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drain can occur due to parasitic draw from various electrical components. Symptoms include a dead battery, especially after sitting for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw is necessary. This may involve testing and replacing faulty components, such as relays, modules, or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Door Roller Failure**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor may fail, resulting in a lack of airflow from the vents. This can be caused by a faulty motor, resistor, or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor, resistor, or repairing the wiring is necessary to restore proper HVAC function.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
