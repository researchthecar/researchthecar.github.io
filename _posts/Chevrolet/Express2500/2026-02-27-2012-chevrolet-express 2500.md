### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Chevrolet Express 2500 demonstrates a generally solid reliability profile, particularly for its utilitarian nature. The powertrain options, while robust, do present some known issues. The V8 engines, especially the 5.3L with Active Fuel Management, can experience lifter problems, and intake manifold leaks are not uncommon across V8 variants. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4-speed 4L60-E, may require attention to the torque converter or solenoids. Beyond the powertrain, common concerns include suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs, electrical gremlins often traced to the BCM or alternator, and typical exterior wear such as rust in common areas. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor can also fail. Despite these points, the Express 2500 remains a dependable choice for commercial and heavy-duty use when properly maintained, with most issues being repairable.
