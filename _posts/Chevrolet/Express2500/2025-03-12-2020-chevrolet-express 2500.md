The 2020 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a full-size van known for its utility and cargo capacity. It offered a few engine options, including the standard 4.3L V6 (276 hp and 298 lb-ft of torque) and the more powerful 6.0L V8 (341 hp and 373 lb-ft of torque). A 2.8L Duramax Diesel engine was also available. The V6 engine was paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and the V8 engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Express for its simple, rugged design and capability, but some dislike its outdated interior, fuel economy, and ride quality compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**4.3L LV1 V6 Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-ups. This can be noticed by a low oil level warning, visible smoke from the exhaust, or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the issue may be related to PCV valve malfunction or worn valve seals. Replacing these components can reduce oil consumption. More severe cases may require engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) to $3000+ (Engine Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L L96 V8 Engine**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, often accompanied by diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420). Potential symptoms include reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, and a sulfurous smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 6.0L V8)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, hesitation when shifting between gears, or a noticeable delay when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, worn or damaged valve body, or internal wear of the transmission components. Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnostics and repair of the valve body or a transmission rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Fluid Flush) to $3000+ (Transmission Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 4.3L V6)**
*   **Shuddering/Vibrating During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, particularly at lower speeds during light acceleration. Can sometimes be mistaken for an engine misfire.
    *   Solution: GM issued TSBs addressing this issue, recommending a triple flush of the transmission fluid using an updated Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid. If the flush doesn't resolve the issue, torque converter replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (Triple Flush) to $1000 - $2000+ (Torque Converter Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag/Failure (Especially on Heavily Loaded Vans)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable sagging in the rear of the van, especially when loaded. This can lead to reduced ground clearance and affect handling and ride quality. Broken or cracked leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the van is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Flickering/Dimming Interior Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The interior lights or headlights may flicker or dim intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check the battery connections, alternator output, and wiring harness for loose connections or corrosion. May also need a new battery or alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (Battery/Alternator Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more door locks fail to operate correctly, either not locking/unlocking or making a grinding noise.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues (Difficulty Opening/Closing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sliding door becomes difficult to open or close, requiring excessive force. May be due to worn rollers, damaged tracks, or a misaligned latch mechanism.
