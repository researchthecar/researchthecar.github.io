### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a generally dependable van, particularly for its intended commercial use. The most common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, specifically intake manifold gasket leaks and, in some cases, head gasket failures on V8 engines, as well as torque converter or solenoid issues in the automatic transmissions. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also subject to wear given the van's load-carrying nature. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Rust is a significant concern for vehicles in corrosive environments. Despite these potential problems, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the Express 2500 can remain a functional and reliable vehicle.
