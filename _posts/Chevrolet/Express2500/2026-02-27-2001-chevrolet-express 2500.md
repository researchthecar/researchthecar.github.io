### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a capable and generally reliable work van, particularly with its robust Vortec V8 engines. However, common issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and potential head gasket failures on larger engines require attention. Transmission reliability is decent, but torque converter and solenoid issues can arise. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the van's load-carrying nature. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are not uncommon. Rust can be a significant concern depending on the climate. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing known issues proactively, the Express 2500 can remain a dependable vehicle.
