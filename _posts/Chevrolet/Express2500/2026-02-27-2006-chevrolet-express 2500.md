### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly for its intended commercial use. The powertrain, especially the V8 gasoline engines and the diesel Duramax with the Allison transmission, tends to be robust. However, common issues include intake manifold gasket leaks on V8s and potential problems with the Active Fuel Management system on the 5.3L. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60-E, can arise, often related to the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the vehicle's load-carrying nature. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM, and alternator failures are also noted. Rust can be a concern on older models, especially in corrosive climates. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing known issues, the Express 2500 can continue to be a dependable work vehicle.
