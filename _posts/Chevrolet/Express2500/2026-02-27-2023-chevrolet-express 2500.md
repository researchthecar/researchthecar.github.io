### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Chevrolet Express 2500 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its gasoline V6 engine option. The diesel engine, while powerful, presents a higher likelihood of encountering issues such as fuel injector problems and EGR system clogging, which are common in modern diesel powertrains. Transmission reliability is good, though the older 6-speed automatic may occasionally exhibit torque converter shudder. Electrical gremlins, like battery drain and infotainment glitches, are present but not overwhelmingly widespread. For owners prioritizing simplicity and minimal potential for complex repairs, the 4.3L V6 engine paired with the 8-speed automatic transmission appears to be the most robust configuration. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for maximizing the longevity and operational efficiency of this commercial van.
