The 2013 Chevrolet Express 2500 is a full-size van known for its versatility and cargo-carrying capacity. It's a popular choice for commercial use and conversion into camper vans. The 2013 model year offered three engine options: a 4.8L Vortec V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 6.0L Vortec V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (260 hp, 525 lb-ft of torque). The standard transmission was a 6L90E six-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Express's simple, robust design and ample space. Common dislikes include the dated interior, relatively poor fuel economy, and handling characteristics typical of a large van.
