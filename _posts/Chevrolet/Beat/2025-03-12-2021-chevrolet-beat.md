The 2021 Chevrolet Beat, primarily sold in markets like India, is a small, fuel-efficient hatchback designed for urban driving. The 2021 Chevrolet Beat in the Indian market comes with a 1.2-liter petrol engine, producing around 77 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.0-liter diesel engine, producing around 56 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Beat for its compact size, maneuverability, and fuel efficiency, making it ideal for congested city streets.
