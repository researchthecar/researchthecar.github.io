The 2001 Chevrolet Metro is a subcompact car known for its exceptional fuel economy and affordability. It was available as a 2-door hatchback and a 4-door sedan. The primary engine option was a 1.0L inline 3-cylinder engine producing around 55 horsepower and 58 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission. The Metro was appreciated for its simplicity, ease of maintenance, and low running costs. However, its small size, limited power, and basic features were points of criticism.
