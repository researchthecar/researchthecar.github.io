**Introduction**
The 1999 Chevrolet Metro is a subcompact hatchback that was offered with two engine options and two transmission options. The base engine was a 1.0-liter three-cylinder that produced 55 horsepower and 56 lb-ft of torque. A 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine was also available, which produced 70 horsepower and 75 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a three-speed automatic transmission.

The Metro was praised for its fuel efficiency and affordability, but it was criticized for its lack of power and poor handling.
