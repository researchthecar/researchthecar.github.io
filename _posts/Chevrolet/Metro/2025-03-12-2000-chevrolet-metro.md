The 2000 Chevrolet Metro is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was offered with two engine options: a 1.0L inline-3 engine producing around 55 horsepower and 58 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3L inline-4 engine producing around 70 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque. The transmissions available were a 5-speed manual and a 3-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Metro's simplicity, low running costs, and ease of parking. Common dislikes include its lack of power, basic interior, and limited safety features.
