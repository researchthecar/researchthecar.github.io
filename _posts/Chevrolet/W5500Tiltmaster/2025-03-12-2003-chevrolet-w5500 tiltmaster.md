The 2003 Chevrolet W5500 Tiltmaster is a medium-duty cab-over truck, commonly used for delivery services, construction, and other commercial applications. It provides decent maneuverability in urban environments due to its cab-over design. The 2003 W5500 typically came with an Isuzu 4HE1-TC 4.8L Turbo Diesel engine, rated around 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the truck's reliability and ease of maintenance, while others find the cab cramped and noisy compared to conventional trucks. The other engine option for this vehicle is a 6.0L V8 gas engine. Transmissions included a five-speed manual or an Aisin A465 four-speed automatic.
