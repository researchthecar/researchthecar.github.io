### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet W5500 Tiltmaster demonstrates a generally reliable profile for its intended commercial use. While the gasoline V8 engines are robust with few widespread issues, the 3.5L Duramax diesel variant can experience specific problems like injector failures and glow plug issues, which are common for diesel engines of that era. Transmission options are largely dependable. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, may show wear under heavy, consistent loads, and rust can be a concern depending on climate. Electrical connections and alternators are typical areas for attention. Interior wear is often cosmetic and related to high usage. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing specific diesel engine concerns, the W5500 remains a capable and durable work vehicle.
