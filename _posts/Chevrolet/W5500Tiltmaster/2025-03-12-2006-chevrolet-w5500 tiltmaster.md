The 2006 Chevrolet W5500 Tiltmaster is a medium-duty cab-over truck designed for commercial applications, offering good maneuverability and visibility. This particular model year offered a 5.7L Vortec V8 gasoline engine producing around 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 7.8L Isuzu inline-6 diesel engine rated around 200 horsepower and 441 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions included manual and automatic options depending on the engine. Owners typically appreciate the truck's tight turning radius and ease of maintenance due to the cab-over design. Dislikes often revolve around the cab's spartan interior, ride quality, and potential for specific engine and transmission issues as the truck ages.

**Engine**

**5.7L Vortec V8 Gasoline**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, often originating from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the truck, a burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. The valve cover gaskets are relatively straightforward, while the oil pan and rear main seal require more labor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for valve cover gaskets, $300 - $800+ for oil pan gasket, $500 - $1200+ for rear main seal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail over time, especially with higher mileage. Symptoms include a check engine light (usually a P0420 code), reduced engine performance, and a rattling sound from the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.8L Isuzu Inline-6 Diesel**

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors can become clogged or fail, leading to rough running, poor fuel economy, and excessive smoke.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per injector.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can develop leaks or fail due to wear and tear. Symptoms include a loss of power, excessive black smoke, and a whistling or screeching noise from the turbo.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair or replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ depending on repair vs. replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs, particularly in the rear, can sag or crack due to heavy use. This leads to a lowered ride height, poor ride quality, and reduced load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or damaged leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle, depending on spring type and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The shocks can wear out, resulting in a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the cab-over design and frequent tilting of the cab for maintenance, the wiring harness can experience wear and tear, leading to broken wires, corroded connectors, and intermittent electrical problems.
    *   Solution: Inspect the wiring harness for damage and repair or replace as needed. Clean and protect electrical connections with dielectric grease.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity and location of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, resulting in a dead battery, dimming lights, and eventual engine shutdown.
    *   Solution: Test the alternator and replace it if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting Cab**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cab rust, especially around the windshield, door seams, and lower body panels, is common in areas with road salt.
    *   Solution: Repair rust with bodywork and paint. Prevent future rust with rustproofing treatments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack due to sun exposure and temperature changes, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ for replacement, $20 - $50+ for a cover.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet W5500 Tiltmaster, while a capable work truck, is prone to certain issues common in vehicles of its age and type. Engine issues, particularly oil leaks on the gasoline engine and injector/turbocharger problems on the diesel, are prevalent. Suspension wear and electrical issues due to wiring harness fatigue are also common concerns. Rust can be a significant problem, especially in regions with road salt. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the severity of the issue, but some repairs can be quite expensive, particularly engine and transmission work.
