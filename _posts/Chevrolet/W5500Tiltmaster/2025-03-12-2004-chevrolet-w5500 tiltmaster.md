The 2004 Chevrolet W5500 Tiltmaster is a medium-duty cab-over truck often used for delivery, construction, and service applications. Engine options for the 2004 model year included the 5.7L Vortec V8 gasoline engine and the 7.8L Isuzu 6HK1-TC diesel engine. The 5.7L gas engine produced approximately 290 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. The Isuzu diesel engine, the more common choice, generated around 200-230 horsepower and 441-516 lb-ft of torque. Drivers appreciate the Tiltmaster for its maneuverability, tight turning radius, and ease of cab access. However, some dislike its relatively spartan interior and potential for specific engine and transmission related problems, especially as the vehicles age.

Diesel engine issues, such as injector and turbocharger failures, can be costly. Suspension and electrical problems are also common. Rust can be a significant concern in certain climates. While some repairs, like replacing a blower motor, are relatively inexpensive, major repairs like rebuilding the transmission or replacing a cylinder head can be very costly. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, paying close attention to the engine, transmission, suspension, and overall condition, and factor in potential repair costs.
