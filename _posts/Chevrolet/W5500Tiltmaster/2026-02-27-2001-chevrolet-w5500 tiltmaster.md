### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet W5500 Tiltmaster demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its gasoline V8 engine options and the robust NV4500 manual transmission. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the older 6.5L Turbo Diesel engine, which can experience issues with its fuel injection pump and glow plug system. Suspension components, specifically leaf springs, may require attention due to heavy use. Electrical connections can degrade over time, leading to intermittent faults. Rust and corrosion are also potential issues, especially on the frame and body, given the vehicle's age and intended use. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing specific diesel engine and potential rust concerns, the W5500 remains a capable workhorse.
