The 2000 Chevrolet W5500 Tiltmaster is a cab-over medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications. Available engine options included the 5.7L gasoline V8 (approximately 270-290 hp and 325-350 lb-ft of torque) and the 7.8L Isuzu 6HE1-TC diesel engine (approximately 200-230 hp and 470-530 lb-ft of torque). The transmission options were commonly either a manual or an automatic. Owners appreciated the truck's maneuverability in urban environments and its robust build for hauling heavy loads. Common complaints centered on the cab-over design making access to the engine for maintenance difficult, and the ride quality could be harsh, especially when unladen. Rust was also a common concern for trucks of this vintage.
