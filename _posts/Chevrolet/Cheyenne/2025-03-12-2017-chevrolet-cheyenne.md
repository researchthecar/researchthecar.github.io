Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2017 Chevrolet Cheyenne, formatted for your website. Please remember that individual experiences may vary and this is based on commonly reported problems.

The 2017 Chevrolet Cheyenne, also known as the Silverado in the US market, is a full-size pickup truck known for its versatility, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 4.3L V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft torque), a 5.3L V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft torque), and a 6.2L V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft torque). Transmissions typically include a 6-speed automatic for the V6 and some V8 models, and an 8-speed automatic for the 6.2L V8 and some 5.3L V8s. Owners often praise the Cheyenne for its robust capabilities and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some common complaints revolve around transmission issues, particularly with the 8-speed automatic, and concerns about fuel economy.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, check engine light. This issue is related to the AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. The lifters in the affected cylinders can fail, causing significant engine problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty lifters, potentially along with the camshaft and other related components. AFM delete kits are also a popular option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Updated valve cover with improved PCV valve to help with oil consumption. Some owners have had to replace piston rings or the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, and 2nd and 3rd gear. A noticeable shudder can occur at low speeds. This is often attributed to the transmission fluid and/or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush using the updated Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid (blue label) that has improved friction modifiers. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **"Chevy Shake" - Vibration at Highway Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A persistent vibration felt through the steering wheel and seats at highway speeds (typically 60-70 mph). This can be caused by a number of things, including unbalanced tires, warped brake rotors, or a defective driveshaft.
    *   Solution: Road force balancing of tires, brake rotor replacement if warped, driveshaft inspection and potential replacement or rebalancing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This is especially common when using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the system, or replacing the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Cheyenne can be a reliable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The most significant concern is the 8-speed automatic transmission's harsh shifting problems, which can be costly to fix. AFM lifter failure on the V8 engines and subsequent oil consumption are also serious concerns. Addressing these issues early can prevent more extensive damage and ensure the longevity of the vehicle. While some problems are minor (like rattling trim), others can lead to substantial repair bills, so a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are crucial before purchasing.
