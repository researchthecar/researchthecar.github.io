Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2020 Chevrolet Cheyenne, formatted according to your specifications. The Cheyenne is essentially the Chevrolet Silverado sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries. The 2020 model offered several engine and transmission choices. Popular engines include the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), paired with either a 6-speed, 8-speed, or 10-speed automatic transmission, depending on the configuration. The 2.7L Turbo engine was also an option, producing 310 hp and 348 lb-ft of torque, coupled with an 8-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Cheyenne/Silverado for its powerful engine options, comfortable ride (depending on trim), and updated infotainment system. Criticisms often include the interior quality (particularly in lower trims), fuel economy (especially with the larger V8 engines), and some reported reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.7L Turbo I4**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining or screeching), check engine light illumination, and potential damage to other engine components if the failure is catastrophic.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit. Inspection of related components (oil lines, intercooler) is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idle, check engine light with codes related to cylinder deactivation, ticking or tapping noises from the engine, and potential for significant engine damage if left unresolved.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM disable kits are also available to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage due to low oil levels.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV valve can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5,000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L V8, this includes misfires, rough idle, check engine light with codes related to cylinder deactivation, ticking or tapping noises from the engine, and potential for significant engine damage if left unresolved.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty lifters and potentially the camshaft. AFM disable kits are also available to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage due to low oil levels.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV valve can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5,000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears, hesitation during acceleration, and a feeling of the transmission "slipping" out of gear.
    *   Solution: A software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. In some cases, replacement of valve body components or the entire transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reflash) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic (10L80/10L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears, hesitation during acceleration, and a feeling of the transmission "slipping" out of gear.
    *   Solution: A software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. In some cases, replacement of valve body components or the entire transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reflash) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring bushings can temporarily alleviate the issue. Replacement of the bushings or the entire leaf spring assembly may be required for a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes and reboots intermittently.
    *   Solution: Performing a hard reset of the infotainment system. A software update from the dealer may also be necessary. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment module is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $1,000+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or after a short period of inactivity, resulting in a vehicle that won't start.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory). Repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**

**Summary**

The 2020 Chevrolet Cheyenne (Silverado) can experience a range of issues, with engine problems (especially AFM lifter failure and oil consumption in the V8 engines) being potentially the most severe and costly. Transmission issues, particularly with the 8-speed and 10-speed automatics, are also relatively common. Electrical glitches and suspension noises are less severe but can still be frustrating for owners. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
