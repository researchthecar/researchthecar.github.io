Here's a breakdown of common problems and complaints associated with the 2010 Chevrolet Cheyenne, organized by category and component, following your specified format. The 2010 Chevrolet Cheyenne (also known as the Silverado in some markets) is a full-size pickup truck known for its dependability and towing capabilities. Available engine options include a 4.3L V6 (195 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.8L V8 (302 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (315 hp/320 hp, 335 lb-ft/340 lb-ft of torque depending on configuration), and a 6.2L V8 (403 hp, 417 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic (primarily with the V6 and some 4.8L V8s) and a 6-speed automatic (mainly with the 5.3L and 6.2L V8s). Owners appreciate its versatility and robust build, while some common dislikes include fuel economy and the dated interior styling compared to newer trucks.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, sometimes exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: The solution varies. Initially, a software update to the engine control module (ECM) was tried. For more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8 (Specifically, engines with Active Fuel Management (AFM))**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is a prevalent issue, often linked to the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system. When cylinders deactivate, oil can be pulled into the combustion chambers.
    *   Solution: Disabling AFM can help reduce oil consumption. This can be done via aftermarket tuning or, in some cases, mechanical deletion of the AFM components. More comprehensive repair may involve replacing valve seals or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (AFM Disabler) - $5,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system can lead to premature lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking noise, rough running engine, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and often the camshaft is required. Deleting the AFM system is recommended during the repair to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L60E)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or harsh, jerky shifts. These can be caused by worn valve body components or a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush might temporarily alleviate the problem. However, valve body rebuild or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild, is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (Valve Body) - $3,000+ (Transmission Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80E)**

*   **Harsh Downshifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky downshifts, especially when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Often resolved with a software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Popping, clunking, or squeaking noises coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Often traced to worn ball joints, tie rod ends, or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn components. It's recommended to replace suspension components in pairs (e.g., both ball joints or both sway bar links).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per component pair (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks. Often, only one or two doors are affected initially.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per actuator (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Panel Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning, erratic readings, or complete failure of the instrument panel.
    *   Solution: Replacing the instrument cluster or sending it in for repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (repair) - $600+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Cab Corners**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower rocker panels and cab corners, especially in areas where road salt is used.
    *   Solution: Cutting out the rusted sections and welding in new metal. Proper rust prevention measures are crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per side, depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates. This is caused by exposure to sunlight and heat.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $30 (cover) - $1000+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor only working on certain settings (usually high) or not working at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Chevrolet Cheyenne is a generally reliable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to oil consumption (especially in 5.3L V8 engines with AFM) and transmission performance. Suspension and electrical issues, while less severe, can also contribute to overall ownership costs. Engine and transmission issues can be the most expensive to address, while suspension and electrical problems are typically more manageable.
