The 2016 Chevrolet Cheyenne, also known as the Chevrolet Silverado in some markets, is a full-size pickup truck appreciated for its robust capabilities, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. Engine options included a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were primarily a 6-speed automatic, though the 8-speed automatic was available on some higher trims with the 5.3L and 6.2L engines. Owners often praise the truck's towing capacity and spacious cabin. Common dislikes include some complaints about the infotainment system responsiveness and occasional reports of drivetrain issues.

**Engine**

**4.3L EcoTec3 V6**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light. Often occurs due to a failed AFM lifter that collapses and damages the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, camshaft, and potentially other related components. Requires significant engine disassembly. Disabling AFM through a tune might prevent future occurrences.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light. Often occurs due to a failed AFM lifter that collapses and damages the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, camshaft, and potentially other related components. Requires significant engine disassembly. Disabling AFM through a tune might prevent future occurrences.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level, blue smoke from the exhaust, frequent need to add oil between oil changes. Can be caused by piston ring issues or faulty valve seals.
    *   Solution:  Diagnosis to determine the cause (piston rings or valve seals). Replacement of the faulty components. In severe cases, a complete engine rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on severity and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shaking or vibrating felt during light acceleration, especially around 40-60 mph. Often caused by worn torque converter clutch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. A transmission flush and filter change might provide temporary relief in mild cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, especially between lower gears. Noticeable clunking noises during shifting. Often related to valve body issues or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush (using the correct fluid spec), valve body replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild. Software updates have sometimes addressed the issue but are not a permanent fix in all cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Upper Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or popping noises from the front suspension, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the upper ball joints. Alignment is recommended after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or randomly reboots.
    *   Solution: Software update to the infotainment system. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Cheyenne/Silverado can be a reliable truck, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. The most concerning problems relate to the Active Fuel Management system in the engines, which can lead to costly repairs, and the 8-speed automatic transmission, which has known issues with harsh shifting. Oil consumption, particularly in the 5.3L and 6.2L engines, is also a potential concern. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and premature wear of suspension components are less severe but still worth noting. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. Potential buyers should have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase to identify any existing or potential problems.
