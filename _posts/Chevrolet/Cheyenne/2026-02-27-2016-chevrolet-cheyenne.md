### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Chevrolet Cheyenne is a generally reliable pickup truck, with most owners experiencing trouble-free operation. The most commonly cited technical issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the V8 engines, specifically the lifters, which can lead to engine performance problems. Transmission issues, such as torque converter shudder, are also reported but are not excessively common. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, can occur. Minor issues with exterior tailgate latches and interior components like power seat adjusters and HVAC blower motors are also noted. Overall, the Cheyenne offers solid dependability, but potential buyers should be aware of the AFM system's propensity for issues and factor in potential repair costs.
