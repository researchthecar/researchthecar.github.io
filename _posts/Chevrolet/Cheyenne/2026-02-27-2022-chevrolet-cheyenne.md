### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Chevrolet Cheyenne demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its V8 engine options and standard transmission. The most commonly cited technical concerns tend to be related to software glitches in the infotainment system and occasional transmission shifting anomalies with the 10-speed automatic, both often addressable with updates. The Duramax diesel engine, while generally robust, can experience DPF-related issues if not used appropriately for its intended driving cycles. Owners of models equipped with the adaptive air suspension should be aware of potential compressor issues. For most buyers, the Cheyenne offers a dependable platform, but awareness of these specific potential issues can help in proactive maintenance and troubleshooting.
