### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet Cheyenne is a generally reliable truck, particularly with its larger V8 engine options.

Transmission issues, especially with the 4-speed automatic, can include torque converter problems and solenoid failures. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to the truck's workload. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM, can also occur. Despite these potential concerns, the Cheyenne's robust construction means that with proper maintenance, it remains a capable and dependable vehicle for its intended purpose.
