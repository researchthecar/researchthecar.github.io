The 2021 Chevrolet Cheyenne, known as the Silverado 1500 in the US market, offers a range of engine options including a 2.7L Turbo, a 4.3L V6, a 5.3L V8, a 6.2L V8, and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel. The transmissions paired with these engines vary, typically including 6-speed, 8-speed, and 10-speed automatic transmissions. The 6.2L V8, for example, produces 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Silverado's strong towing capabilities, comfortable ride, and available technology, but some common complaints involve the quality of interior materials, infotainment system glitches, and certain engine/transmission performance issues.

**Engine**

**2.7L Turbo**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can be indicated by a low oil pressure warning light or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update may help manage oil consumption. If the issue persists, inspection of the PCV system and potential piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbocharger, loss of power, engine misfires, and potential engine stalling. Diagnostic codes related to turbocharger performance may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise coming from the engine, rough idle, misfires, and a check engine light. Diagnostic codes often point to cylinder deactivation issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder heads. AFM disabler kits may also be installed to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**
*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel injector performance or fuel pressure may be present.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty injector(s) followed by replacement. Recalibration of the fuel system might be necessary after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Cheyenne/Silverado 1500 has some notable issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly related to AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption in the V8 engines, can be severe and costly to repair. Transmission issues with the 10-speed automatic are also a concern. Electrical glitches, such as infotainment system problems and backup camera failures, are more common and generally less expensive to resolve. The power running boards can also be a source of problems. Overall, while the Cheyenne/Silverado 1500 offers a robust driving experience, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider getting a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing or potential issues.
