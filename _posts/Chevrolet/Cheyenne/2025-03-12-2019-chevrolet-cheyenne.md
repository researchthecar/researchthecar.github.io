Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Chevrolet Cheyenne (also known as the Silverado 1500 in the US market). The 2019 Cheyenne/Silverado 1500 marked the start of a new generation with a redesigned body and updated technology. Engine options included a 4.3L V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 2.7L turbocharged inline-4 (310 hp, 348 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), a 6.2L V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), and later in the model year, a 3.0L Duramax diesel inline-6 (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included 6-speed, 8-speed, and 10-speed automatics, depending on the engine. Owners often praised the truck's updated styling, increased interior space, and improved fuel economy (especially with the 2.7L turbo). Common complaints revolved around the perceived quality of some interior materials, the responsiveness of the 8-speed transmission, and some initial reliability concerns with the new platform.
