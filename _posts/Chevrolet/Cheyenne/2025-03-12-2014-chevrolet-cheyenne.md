Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2014 Chevrolet Cheyenne, categorized by major components and engine/transmission configurations where applicable. Note that the Chevrolet Cheyenne is the Mexican market name for the Chevrolet Silverado 1500. Therefore, the information below refers to the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500.

The 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a full-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, strong towing capability, and relatively fuel-efficient engine options. Available engine choices include a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6 (285 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the truck's quiet cabin and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include concerns about the quality of interior materials and some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**4.3L EcoTec3 V6**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system is designed to shut down cylinders under light load to improve fuel economy. However, the lifters associated with this system can fail, leading to misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. This often results in a ticking or knocking sound.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, and potentially the camshaft if damaged. Some owners opt to disable AFM or replace the lifters with non-AFM versions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.3L V6, the 5.3L V8 also suffers from AFM lifter failures, leading to misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. This is often accompanied by a noticeable ticking or knocking sound, particularly at idle.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, potentially the camshaft if damaged, and addressing any consequential damage to the engine. AFM can also be disabled or replaced with non-AFM lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 5.3L V8 engines experience excessive oil consumption, sometimes attributed to piston ring design or issues with the AFM system. Owners report needing to add oil frequently between changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust can be a symptom.
    *   Solution: Potential solutions include replacing the valve cover, piston rings, or even the entire engine, depending on the severity. Some have had success with revised PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) systems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+ (depending on the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.2L V8 can also experience AFM lifter failures, mirroring the issues found in the 4.3L V6 and 5.3L V8.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, potentially the camshaft if damaged. AFM can also be disabled or replaced with non-AFM lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibrating sensation, particularly at lower speeds or during light acceleration. This is often caused by wear or degradation of the torque converter clutch.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the torque converter. A transmission flush might provide temporary relief in mild cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts between gears. This can be caused by valve body issues, worn clutches, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause (valve body, clutches, etc.) and replacing the faulty components. A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+ (depending on the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Upper Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. This is often due to the premature wear of the upper control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the upper control arm bushings or the entire upper control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery draining overnight or within a few days, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic draw (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessories) and repairing or replacing the component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent freezing, Crashing, or unresponsiveness of the MyLink infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. Replacing the infotainment unit might be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracking Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover to conceal the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (Cheyenne in Mexico) can be a capable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The most concerning problems relate to the Active Fuel Management system in the engines, which can lead to costly repairs. Excessive oil consumption in the 5.3L V8 is another factor to consider. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter shudder, are also relatively common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can quickly add up, making a pre-purchase inspection crucial.
