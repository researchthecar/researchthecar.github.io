Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints related to the 2022 Chevrolet Cheyenne (which is primarily sold as the Silverado 1500 in North America), formatted for your website. Note that "Cheyenne" is a trim level in some markets, but I'll assume you're referring to the full-size pickup truck generally.

The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 offers a range of engine options including a 2.7L Turbo I4 (310 hp, 430 lb-ft torque), a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft torque), a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft torque), and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I6 (277 hp, 460 lb-ft torque). Transmission options primarily include an 8-speed automatic (paired with the 2.7L and some 5.3L models) and a 10-speed automatic (paired with the 6.2L, 3.0L diesel, and some 5.3L models). Owners often praise the Silverado for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin (especially in crew cab configurations), and powerful engine options. Common complaints often include the quality of some interior materials, particularly on lower trim levels, and occasionally issues with the infotainment system.
