Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2007 Chevrolet Cheyenne (also known as the Silverado 1500) with a focus on providing specific details for different engine and transmission configurations.

The 2007 Chevrolet Cheyenne/Silverado 1500 is a popular full-size truck known for its reliability and capability. Engine options included a 4.3L V6 (195 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.8L V8 (295 hp, 305 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (315-320 hp, 335-340 lb-ft of torque, depending on configuration), and a 6.0L V8 (367 hp, 375 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were primarily a 4-speed automatic (4L60E) and a 6-speed automatic (6L80E), with the 6-speed typically paired with the larger engines. Owners generally appreciate the truck's towing capacity and comfortable ride, but some common complaints include issues with the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in certain V8 engines and various electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**4.8L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**5.3L V8 (with Active Fuel Management)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption (often exceeding 1 quart per 1,000 miles).  Often accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust, especially after startup or acceleration. Can lead to fouled spark plugs and catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Revised valve cover with improved oil baffling. Replacement of piston rings with an updated design that is less prone to oil passage. Disable AFM through tuning (though this may void warranty).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Lifter Failure (Related to AFM)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the top of the engine. Misfires. Check engine light. Decreased performance. Can be caused by faulty AFM lifters collapsing due to oil starvation.
    * Solution: Replace failed lifters and often the camshaft. Disable AFM system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
**6.0L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L60E)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, especially when cold. Harsh or erratic shifts. Can be caused by worn valve body, worn clutches, or low fluid level.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change (if problem is minor). Valve body replacement or rebuild. Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change), $500 - $1,500 (valve body), $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at low speeds or when accelerating. Stalling. Can be caused by worn torque converter clutches.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80E)**

*   **Harsh Downshifts/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jarring downshifts, particularly when coming to a stop. A noticeable "clunk" sound can be heard.
    *   Solution: Programming update to the transmission control module (TCM). Valve body replacement/rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (programming), $500 - $1,500 (valve body)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Clunking/Popping Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping sound coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Often caused by worn ball joints, tie rod ends, or stabilizer bar links.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints, tie rod ends, stabilizer bar links, and/or sway bar bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on parts replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.) malfunctioning or reading inaccurately. Intermittent lighting issues in the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Instrument cluster repair or replacement. Often requires sending the cluster to a specialized repair shop.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks failing to lock or unlock properly.  Intermittent operation.
    *   Solution: Door lock actuator replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Cab Corners**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower rocker panels and cab corners, especially in areas with road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair (cutting out rusted sections and welding in new metal) and painting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Cheyenne/Silverado 1500 is generally a reliable truck, but it has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around excessive oil consumption and AFM-related lifter failures in the 5.3L V8 engine. Electrical issues, particularly with the instrument panel and door lock actuators, are also fairly common. Suspension components can wear, leading to clunking noises. Rust can be a problem in regions with harsh winters. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor electrical fixes to several thousand dollars for engine repairs.
