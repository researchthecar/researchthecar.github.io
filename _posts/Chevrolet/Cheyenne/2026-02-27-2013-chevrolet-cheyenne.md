### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Chevrolet Cheyenne is a generally reliable truck, particularly its gasoline V8 powertrains and automatic transmissions. The Duramax diesel engine, while powerful, is more prone to specific emissions-related issues like DPF problems and glow plug failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and occasional battery drain, are the most commonly cited non-powertrain concerns. Suspension and exterior components tend to hold up well, and interior wear is typical for a vehicle of this age and class. With proper maintenance, especially for the diesel variant, the Cheyenne can offer many years of service.
