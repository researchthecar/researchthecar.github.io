### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Chevrolet Cheyenne generally presents a reliable profile for a full-size pickup. The most frequently cited technical issues revolve around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the gasoline V8 engines, which can lead to lifter problems requiring significant repair. Diesel models may encounter Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) regeneration issues. The 8-speed automatic transmission has seen some reports of harsh shifting, often addressable with software updates or fluid services. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. However, these issues do not appear to be systemic across the entire model range, and many owners report a trouble-free experience. Regular maintenance and addressing early symptoms promptly are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
