### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Chevrolet Cheyenne, particularly models equipped with the 5.3L V8 engine, can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues like Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter problems and oil consumption. Transmission issues, while not universal, can also arise, with torque converter and solenoid pack failures being noted. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module, are also a possibility. The suspension, exterior, and interior generally hold up well, with no widespread critical failures reported beyond normal wear and tear. Careful inspection and maintenance history review are recommended for this model year.
