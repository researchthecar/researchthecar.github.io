* **Intake Manifold Runner Control Failure:** The intake manifold runner control system may malfunction, resulting in reduced engine performance. Replacement of the runner control solenoids is often required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Slipping Gears:** The transmission may slip out of gear while driving, causing a loss of power or unexpected gear changes. Rebuild or replacement of the transmission is often necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **TCC Solenoid Malfunction:** The torque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid may fail, causing shuddering or slipping during gear changes. Replacement of the solenoid and valve body is typically required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front Struts Wear:** The front struts may wear over time, leading to reduced handling and stability. Replacement of the struts is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure:** The rear shock absorbers may fail, causing a rough ride and reduced braking stability. Replacement of the shock absorbers is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail to charge the battery, leading to electrical system malfunctions and vehicle shutdown. Replacement of the alternator is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600+
* **Starter Solenoid Failure:** The starter solenoid may fail, preventing the starter from engaging the flywheel. Replacement of the starter solenoid is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
* **Power Window Switch Failure:** The power window switches may fail, causing the windows to become non-functional. Replacement of the switch assembly is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

* **Headlight Lens Oxidation:** The plastic headlight lenses may oxidize over time, reducing light output. Polishing or replacement of the lens covers is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracks:** The dashboard may develop cracks due to sun exposure and temperature variations. Replacement of the dashboard panel is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may malfunction, resulting in reduced heating or cooling performance. Diagnosis and repair of the system is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Summary:**

The 1995 Chevrolet Lumina APV is generally a reliable and practical vehicle, but it does have some notable issues. Engine problems, particularly with the timing chain tensioner on the 3.4L V6, can be severe and costly. Transmission issues, such as slipping gears on the 4-speed automatic, may require extensive repairs. Electrical and suspension components can also fail, leading to various problems and diminished driving experience. However, the interior and exterior issues are typically minor and can be addressed with reasonable costs. Overall, the Lumina APV offers a good value for its intended purpose, but it is essential to be aware of the potential issues before making a purchase decision.
