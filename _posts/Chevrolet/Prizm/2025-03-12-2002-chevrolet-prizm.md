The 2002 Chevrolet Prizm is a compact sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency, a rebadged Toyota Corolla. The sole engine option was a 1.8L DOHC 1ZZ-FE inline-4 engine producing 125 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Prizm's longevity, fuel economy, and comfortable ride. Common complaints often revolved around its somewhat bland styling, limited features compared to competitors, and potentially noisy engine at higher RPMs.
