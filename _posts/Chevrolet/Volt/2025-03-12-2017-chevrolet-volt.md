Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2017 Chevrolet Volt, formatted for your website's structure.

The 2017 Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) known for its impressive electric range and fuel efficiency. It combines an electric drive system with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine that acts as a range extender. The engine produces 101 horsepower and is paired with a two-motor drive unit. What people generally like about the Volt is its ability to drive primarily on electric power for daily commutes, reducing fuel costs and emissions. They also appreciate its smooth ride and quiet cabin. Common complaints center around limited rear passenger space, some concerns about long-term battery reliability, and occasionally, issues with the electronic systems.

**Electric Motor**

**Two-Motor Drive Unit**

*   **Reduced Propulsion/Loss of Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may display a "Reduced Propulsion Power" message, and the car will experience a noticeable decrease in power and acceleration. In some instances, the vehicle may not move at all. Diagnostic codes related to the drive motor control module or motor performance may be present.
    *   Solution: This issue often stems from a faulty drive motor generator control module (commonly referred to as the BECM â€“ Battery Energy Control Module). Replacement of the BECM and reprogramming is typically required. Some cases have also pointed to issues with the motor generator itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Trouble shifting between drive modes (D, N, R), a clunking sound when shifting, or the vehicle failing to shift into the desired gear.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update for the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, physical inspection and repair of the shift linkage or replacement of the transmission itself may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) to $4000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Reduced Electric Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable decline in the vehicle's all-electric range compared to its original range. This could be due to cell degradation or other factors affecting battery performance.
    *   Solution: A battery management system (BMS) recalibration can sometimes improve the estimated range. In more severe cases, individual battery modules or the entire battery pack may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (BMS recalibration) to $8000+ (battery replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4 Range Extender**

*   **Engine Stalling/Rough Running**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly, especially when it kicks on to provide supplemental power. The engine may also run roughly or hesitate.
    *   Solution: This is often traced to issues with the fuel injectors. Fuel injector replacement may be necessary. Another cause is the Mass Airflow Sensor, which may need to be replaced if it is sending the wrong readings to the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical System**

*   **Charging Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle fails to charge or charges intermittently. The charging port may show error messages or the charging process may stop unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Inspect the charging cable and charging port for damage. A faulty onboard charger can also cause this issue, requiring replacement. Check the 12v battery as this can cause issues when the voltage is low.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system may freeze, crash, or experience glitches. The touchscreen may become unresponsive or display incorrect information.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve some infotainment issues. In some cases, the infotainment system module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $800+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**HVAC**

*   **HVAC Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the vehicle's HVAC system, including air conditioning and heat functions.
    *   Solution: Check the HVAC control module and blower motor. Replace any damaged components as necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2017 Chevrolet Volt, while generally reliable and fuel-efficient, can experience issues related to its electric drive system, battery, and infotainment system. The most concerning problems involve the BECM, which can lead to reduced propulsion power, and potential battery degradation impacting electric range. Repair costs can range from relatively minor expenses for software updates to significant outlays for battery replacements. Addressing these issues promptly can prevent more extensive damage and ensure the vehicle's long-term performance.
