The 2015 Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that offers a unique blend of electric driving range and gasoline-powered extended range. It features a 1.5L Inline-4 engine paired with a two-motor drive unit. The gasoline engine produces 101 horsepower and 111 lb-ft of torque, primarily serving as a generator for the electric motors. The electric motors deliver 149 horsepower and instant torque, enabling brisk acceleration. Owners often praise the Volt for its silent electric driving experience, fuel efficiency, and government tax incentives. Conversely, some criticisms include its limited rear passenger space and reliance on gasoline when the battery is depleted.

**Electric Motor**

**Two-Motor Drive Unit**

* **Reduced Propulsion Power**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle displays a "Reduced Propulsion Power" message on the driver information center and exhibits significantly reduced acceleration. This issue can be intermittent or constant and is often accompanied by a check engine light.
    * Solution: The issue is often traced to the Transmission Input Speed Sensor. Replacing the transmission input speed sensor and reprogram the hybrid powertrain control module to calibrate the new sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

* **Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time and with increased mileage, the battery pack's capacity can degrade, leading to a reduced electric driving range. This is a natural phenomenon for all electric vehicle batteries.
    * Solution: While minor degradation is normal, significant loss of range could indicate a failing battery module. Replacement of the faulty module can be done, but a complete battery replacement is the most common repair for severe degradation.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $10,000+ (full battery pack replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Charging System**

* **Charging Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may fail to charge, either through a standard 120V outlet or a 240V charging station. Error messages may appear on the dashboard or charging station display.
    * Solution: Diagnosis can involve checking the charging port, the onboard charger, and the charging cable. Replacement of a faulty onboard charger or repair of the charging port wiring may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,200+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical System**

* **Service High Voltage Charging System Warning**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report getting a "Service High Voltage Charging System" error message. The car may still drive, but charging is disabled. The cause is typically related to the Battery Control Module, wiring harness, or other high voltage components.
    * Solution: Requires diagnostic tests with a high-voltage-certified technician to pinpoint the faulty component. Replacement of the affected module or wiring repair is typically needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **HVAC Control Module Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC control module may fail, causing issues with controlling the vehicle's heating and air conditioning systems. This can manifest as the system being stuck on a particular setting, not responding to inputs, or displaying incorrect information.
    * Solution: Replacement of the HVAC control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Tail Light Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the tail light housings, causing condensation. This can affect visibility and potentially damage the bulb sockets.
    * Solution: Removal of the tail lights, drying the interior, and sealing any potential points of entry for moisture. Replacement of the tail light assembly if the condensation is excessive or causes damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or slow response times. This may affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    * Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the infotainment system may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ (depending on the issue and repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Volt, while offering a compelling blend of electric and gasoline power, exhibits some common issues. The most concerning are the electric motor and charging system problems, which can be costly to repair. Battery degradation is a natural part of electric vehicle ownership. Other issues like infotainment glitches and tail light condensation are less severe but can still be frustrating for owners. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
