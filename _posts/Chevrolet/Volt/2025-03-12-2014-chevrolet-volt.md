The 2014 Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid vehicle known for its fuel efficiency and extended electric driving range. It features a 1.4L Inline-4 engine paired with a two-motor drive unit, effectively acting as a transmission. The 1.4L engine produces 83 horsepower and 111 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the Volt's ability to drive solely on electric power for a significant range, reducing fuel consumption for daily commutes. However, some common complaints include a sometimes rough transition between electric and gas power, battery degradation over time, and certain electrical issues.

**Electric Motor**

**Drive Unit (Two-Motor Electric Drive System)**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power/Service High Voltage Charging System Message**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a "Reduced Propulsion Power" message on the dashboard, often accompanied by a "Service High Voltage Charging System" message. This can result in the car going into "limp mode" with significantly reduced speed and acceleration. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to the high-voltage battery system are often present.
    *   Solution: The underlying cause can range from faulty battery modules within the high-voltage battery pack, a malfunctioning battery control module (BECM), or issues with the charging system. Diagnosis requires specialized equipment to read the DTCs and test the high-voltage components. Replacing faulty battery modules or the BECM can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $8,000+ (depending on the issue and if the entire battery pack needs replacing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.4L Inline-4 (LUV) Range Extender**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Rough Running**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1.4L engine, which acts as a range extender, can sometimes experience hesitation or rough running when it engages to supplement the electric motor. This can be more noticeable during cold starts or under heavy acceleration.
    *   Solution: Potential causes include a faulty mass airflow (MAF) sensor, clogged fuel injectors, or a malfunctioning ignition coil. Diagnosis typically involves checking for DTCs and testing the relevant components. Cleaning or replacing the MAF sensor, fuel injectors, or ignition coils can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the specific part needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light - Purge Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common cause of the check engine light in the 2014 Volt is a faulty purge valve. Symptoms include a check engine light, difficulty filling the gas tank, and potentially poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the purge valve resolves this issue. It's a relatively straightforward repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Two-Motor Electric Drive Unit (Integrated with Electric Motors)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Battery**

*   **Battery Degradation / Reduced Electric Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the high-voltage battery pack in the 2014 Volt can experience degradation, resulting in a reduced electric driving range. The amount of degradation varies depending on factors such as driving habits, charging practices, and environmental conditions.
    *   Solution: Unfortunately, battery degradation is a natural process. Owners can try to mitigate it by following best practices for charging (e.g., avoiding consistently charging to 100% or depleting to 0%) and avoiding extreme temperatures. In severe cases, replacing battery modules or the entire battery pack may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on severity and if individual modules or the entire pack needs replacing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with charging the Volt, including the car not charging at all, slow charging speeds, or error messages related to the charging system.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include a faulty charging port, a malfunctioning on-board charger, or problems with the charging cable or electrical outlet. Diagnosis requires checking the charging system components and the electrical supply. Replacing the faulty component (charging port, on-board charger, or charging cable) can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Software Glitches/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system in the 2014 Volt can sometimes experience software glitches, leading to problems such as a blank screen, frozen system, or unresponsive touch screen.
    *   Solution: A simple reset of the system may resolve minor glitches. However, more serious issues may require a software update or replacement of the infotainment system module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $800+ (infotainment module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Heater Not Working Properly**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heater not blowing hot air, or the heat being intermittent. This is due to a valve in the coolant system that goes bad.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve in the coolant system will fix this.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Volt presents a mix of potential issues. While some issues can be minor and inexpensive to address (like a purge valve), others, such as battery degradation or high-voltage charging system problems, can be quite costly to repair. The severity and cost of repairs largely depend on the extent of battery degradation and the specific electrical faults encountered. It's recommended that prospective buyers have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified technician experienced with hybrid vehicles, especially paying close attention to the health of the high-voltage battery.
