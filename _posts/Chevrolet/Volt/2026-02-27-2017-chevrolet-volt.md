### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Chevrolet Volt demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its electric drive components. The primary concerns tend to be related to the longevity of the 12V auxiliary battery and potential software glitches within the infotainment system. The main high-voltage battery pack, while generally robust, can experience degradation over time, leading to reduced range, which is a significant cost if replacement is needed outside of warranty. The gasoline range extender engine is relatively straightforward but can be susceptible to coolant leaks and engine mount wear. For owners, proactive monitoring of coolant levels and attention to any unusual vibrations or electrical system behavior are recommended.
