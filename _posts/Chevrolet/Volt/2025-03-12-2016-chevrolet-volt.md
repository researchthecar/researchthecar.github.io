The 2016 Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that offers a blend of electric driving range and gasoline-powered extended range capability. The 2016 Volt is equipped with a 1.5L inline 4-cylinder engine paired with a two-motor drive unit that work together to deliver 149 horsepower and 294 lb-ft of torque. The Volt is praised for its quiet electric operation, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. However, some owners have reported issues with the car's charging system, infotainment system, and occasionally with the extended range engine components.

**Electric Motor**

**Two-Motor Drive Unit**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Drivers may experience a "Reduced Propulsion Power" message on the dashboard, accompanied by a significant reduction in available power. This can occur intermittently or consistently and may be related to issues within the drive unit.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing this issue typically involves scanning for diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to the drive unit, battery management system, or related components. Repair may involve replacing faulty sensors, repairing wiring harnesses, or in some cases, replacing parts of the drive unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hybrid Powertrain Control Module Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Can trigger diagnostic codes for the regenerative braking system, electric drive motor, or other powertrain control systems. Symptoms can include difficulty shifting, a loss of electric power, and the vehicle being unable to start.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves scanning for diagnostic trouble codes and pinpointing the failed module. Replacement and reprogramming of the module are necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.5L I4 Engine**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Rough Running**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine hesitation or rough running when the gasoline engine engages to supplement the electric motor. This can be more noticeable during cold starts or when the engine is under load.
    *   Solution: Potential causes can include issues with the fuel injectors, ignition system, or engine control unit (ECU). Diagnostic testing is needed to pinpoint the root cause. Repairs can range from cleaning or replacing injectors to addressing issues with the ignition coils or ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors may experience failure or clogging over time, resulting in poor engine performance, misfires, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Fuel injector cleaning or replacement is typically required to resolve this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Charging System**

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to charge, slow charging, or errors during the charging process. The car may not accept a charge from a Level 1 or Level 2 charger, or the charging process may stop prematurely.
    *   Solution: The charging system, on earlier models, has been known to have issues with corrosion forming around the terminals of the charger. Cleaning the corrosion off the terminals may fix the issue. If the charger is not sending the correct voltage to the terminals, the on-board charger may be faulty. The charger is located under the hood, and the connector can be exposed to moisture. In most cases, the faulty on-board charger will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Service High Voltage Charging System Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Display of the "Service High Voltage Charging System" warning light on the dashboard. This indicates a problem with the Volt's high-voltage charging system, which could range from minor sensor issues to more serious malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves using a scan tool to retrieve diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and pinpoint the source of the problem. Potential fixes may include replacing faulty sensors, repairing wiring harnesses, or addressing issues within the charging module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, or issues with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration.
    *   Solution: Updating the infotainment system software can often resolve these issues. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dead 12V Battery**
    * Description/Symptoms: Can cause a no-start situation and loss of various electronic functions.
    * Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery is the standard fix. Ensuring proper charging system function is important to prevent recurrence.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Condensation**
