### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Chevrolet Volt, while a groundbreaking vehicle, exhibits some common first-generation issues. The electrical system, particularly the high-voltage battery pack and the 12V auxiliary battery, are the most frequently cited areas for potential concern, with battery degradation and premature 12V failure being notable. The gasoline range-extender engine can experience coolant leaks and engine mount issues. Interior electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches, are also reported. However, the transmission and suspension systems generally hold up well. Owners should be aware of these potential reliability points, especially concerning the battery and electrical components, as they may require attention outside of standard maintenance.
