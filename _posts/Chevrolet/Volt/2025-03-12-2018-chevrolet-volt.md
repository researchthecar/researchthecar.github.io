The 2018 Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that combines an electric motor with a gasoline engine to provide both electric-only driving and extended range. The Volt is equipped with a 1.5L Inline-4 engine producing 101 hp and 103 lb-ft torque, coupled with a two-motor drive unit, providing a total system output of 149 horsepower and 294 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally praise the Volt for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and ability to drive primarily on electric power for daily commutes. Common dislikes include the limited rear seat space and the occasionally quirky behavior of the infotainment system.

**Electric Motor**

*   **Drive Motor Generator Unit Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise coming from the drive unit. Can lead to reduced performance and eventually complete failure of the drive unit.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected bearing or the entire drive motor generator unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+

**Battery/Charging System**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power/Service High Voltage Charging System Messages**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle displays a "Reduced Propulsion Power" or "Service High Voltage Charging System" message on the dashboard. It can also occur during or after charging. The car may experience limited power output or fail to charge properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is required to determine the root cause, which can range from faulty sensors, wiring harness issues, or problems within the battery management system (BMS). May require replacing the affected module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Hesitation or Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine hesitating or stalling, particularly when the vehicle is switching between electric and gasoline power. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Potential causes include issues with the fuel injectors, mass airflow sensor, or engine control unit (ECU). Diagnosis and repair by a qualified technician is recommended. Cleaning of the fuel injectors or replacing the mass airflow sensor can be a solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Two-Motor Drive Unit**

*   **Harsh Shifting or Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh shifting or jerking sensations, particularly during low-speed maneuvers. This can be related to the operation of the two-motor drive unit and the way it blends electric and gasoline power.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may address this issue. In some cases, a more comprehensive transmission service or repair may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Intermittent Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may display false readings from various sensors, such as the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), or other safety sensors. These sensors can fail and provide false data.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

**HVAC**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
