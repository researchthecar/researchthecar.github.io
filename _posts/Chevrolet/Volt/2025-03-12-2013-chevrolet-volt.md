The 2013 Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) known for its innovative powertrain and fuel efficiency. It features a 1.4L inline-4 engine (83 hp/111 lb-ft) paired with a 111-kW (149 hp) electric motor, offering a combined 149 horsepower. It utilizes a Voltec drive system, which combines the gasoline engine and electric motor, operating in various modes to maximize efficiency. People appreciate the Volt for its ability to drive solely on electric power for a significant range, reducing fuel consumption for daily commutes. However, some dislike the limited rear passenger space and the occasional complexity of the hybrid system, as well as potentially higher maintenance costs associated with a hybrid powertrain.

**Electric Motor**

**111-kW Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power/Service High Voltage Soon Message**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "Reduced Propulsion Power" message displays on the dashboard, and the vehicle may experience a significant reduction in power, and display a "Service High Voltage Soon" message. This can be caused by a faulty battery energy control module (BECM).
    *   Solution: Replace the BECM with an updated unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more battery modules within the main high-voltage battery pack may fail. This can cause a reduction in range, charging issues, and illumination of the check engine light. Error codes related to specific battery modules will be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed battery module or the entire battery pack is necessary. Module replacement can be complex and requires specialized tools and knowledge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $8000+ (depending on whether one module or the whole pack is replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Voltec Drive System**

*   **"Shift to Park" Error**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle displays a "Shift to Park" error message even when the vehicle is already in park, preventing the vehicle from turning off. This issue can be caused by a faulty shifter lever position sensor or wiring issues within the shifter assembly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shifter lever position sensor or the entire shifter assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Rough Running**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience hesitation, rough idling, or misfires. This issue can occur when the engine engages to supplement the electric motor.
    * Solution: Check and replace the spark plugs, inspect and clean the fuel injectors, and verify the proper function of the ignition coils.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks may develop from various locations, including the water pump, hoses, or radiator. These leaks can lead to engine overheating and potential damage.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak by replacing the faulty component (water pump, hose, radiator, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A creaking or clunking noise coming from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning. This can be caused by worn strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Charging Issues (Not Charging/Slow Charging)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Volt may experience issues with charging, including not charging at all or charging at a significantly slower rate than expected. This can be caused by a faulty charge port, charging cable, or the onboard charging module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the charging system to identify the faulty component (charge port, charging cable, onboard charger). Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor may fail, resulting in no airflow from the vents or intermittent operation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation building up inside the headlight housings.
