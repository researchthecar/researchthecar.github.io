The 2012 Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) known for its innovative powertrain that combines an electric motor with a gasoline engine serving as a generator. It was a pioneering vehicle in the electrification of personal transportation. The 2012 Volt utilizes a 1.4L inline-4 gasoline engine (84 hp), primarily used as a generator, coupled with a 111-kW (149 hp) electric motor. The electric motor produces 273 lb-ft of torque. People often appreciate the Volt for its fuel efficiency in electric mode and its extended range capabilities. Some common complaints include the complexity of the hybrid system, potential high repair costs, and the initial purchase price.

**Electric Motor**

**111-kW Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle displays "Reduced Propulsion Power" message on the dashboard and the car's acceleration is significantly reduced. This can occur even with sufficient battery charge.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is needed, which often involves checking the battery management system, high voltage wiring, and electric motor components. Sometimes a software update to the hybrid powertrain control module can resolve the issue. In some instances, replacing faulty sensors or modules is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**16-kWh Lithium-Ion Battery Pack**

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the battery's capacity can degrade, resulting in a shorter electric driving range. The symptom is a noticeable decrease in the miles the vehicle can travel on a full charge compared to when it was new.
    *   Solution: Battery degradation is a natural process. No direct fix exists except for replacing the battery pack. Replacing individual modules *may* be an option but can be difficult to source parts and labor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $8,000+ for a complete battery replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.4L Inline-4 (LUU)**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can occur, especially when the engine is running to generate power for the electric motor. Symptoms include rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to misfires (e.g., P0300) may be present.
    *   Solution: The cause could be faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, fuel injectors, or vacuum leaks. Diagnosis involves checking these components and replacing any that are found to be defective. A compression test may be necessary to rule out more serious engine problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the parts needing replacement and the labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can develop, particularly around the water pump or hoses. Symptoms include a low coolant level warning light, overheating, and visible coolant leaks under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: The affected components must be replaced. This may involve replacing the water pump, hoses, or gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+, depending on the location of the leak and the parts that need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Voltec Drive System**

*   **Shifting Problems/Harsh Transitions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Voltec drive system can exhibit harsh transitions between electric and gasoline power. While it is not a traditional transmission, it uses planetary gears and clutches to manage power flow. Symptoms include jarring shifts and a noticeable lag in power delivery.
    *   Solution: A software update to the hybrid powertrain control module may address some shift-related issues. In some cases, mechanical issues with the Voltec drive unit require diagnosis and repair by a specialist.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+, depending on the cause and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Charging Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with charging can occur, including the car not charging at all, slow charging, or error messages during the charging process.
    *   Solution: Check the charging cable, the charging port on the car, and the charging station. It may be a faulty charger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on which parts are replaced
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light / Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light can illuminate due to a variety of reasons, including issues with the hybrid powertrain, emissions system, or other electrical components. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) provide clues about the nature of the problem.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic scan is needed to identify the DTCs and pinpoint the cause of the problem. The repair depends on the specific DTCs and can range from simple fixes to more complex repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100+, depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation and reduced visibility.
    *   Solution: Some owners drill small drainage holes in the bottom of the headlight housing. A more proper fix would be to replace the headlights or reseal the original headlights.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+, depending on whether you are resealing the headlights or replacing them.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Screen Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The touchscreen in the center console can exhibit delamination, where the layers of the screen separate, causing visual distortion and potentially affecting touch sensitivity.
    *   Solution: The screen will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Volt, while innovative, can experience several issues, primarily related to its complex hybrid powertrain and electrical components. Battery degradation is a long-term concern, and the Voltec drive system can exhibit shifting issues. Engine problems like misfires and coolant leaks can also occur. Electrical issues like charging problems and diagnostic trouble codes are common. Some interior and exterior issues, such as center console screen delamination and headlight condensation, may also arise. The cost of repairs can vary widely, from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements like the battery pack or Voltec drive unit.
