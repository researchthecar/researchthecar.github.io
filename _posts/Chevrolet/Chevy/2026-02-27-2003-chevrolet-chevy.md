### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet Chevy models, while offering an economical entry point into vehicle ownership, are not without their potential reliability concerns. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's gasket integrity (particularly intake manifolds on V6 engines), transmission durability, and electrical gremlins stemming from the Body Control Module. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can also wear prematurely. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior wear are also points to consider. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs, especially for higher-mileage examples. Regular maintenance is crucial, but be prepared for specific common repairs.
