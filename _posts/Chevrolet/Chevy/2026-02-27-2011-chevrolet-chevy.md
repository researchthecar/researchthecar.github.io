Automatic transmissions, particularly the 6-speed, may experience harsh shifting or torque converter problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and struts can wear prematurely. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and power window motors are also noted. However, the manual transmission and exterior components are generally reliable. Interior issues are typically limited to the HVAC blower motor. Overall, while not without its potential problems, many issues are repairable, and regular maintenance can mitigate some risks.
