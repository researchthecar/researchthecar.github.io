### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Chevy is a budget-friendly subcompact that offers basic transportation. Its reliability is commensurate with its price point, meaning owners should anticipate some common issues, particularly concerning oil and coolant leaks from the Ecotec engines, and potential wear on suspension components like ball joints and tie rods. The manual transmission generally holds up better than the automatic, which can exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, such as alternator failures and window regulator issues, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate and maintenance. While not a premium vehicle, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the 2005 Chevy can remain a functional daily driver.
