The 2006 Chevrolet Chevy, specifically the Impala, was a popular full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and value for money. Available engine options included a 3.5L V6 (211 hp, 214 lb-ft torque) and a 3.9L V6 (242 hp, 240 lb-ft torque). Both were paired with a 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Impala's reliability and fuel efficiency for its size, but common complaints centered around some specific mechanical and electrical issues that emerged as the cars aged.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks externally from the intake manifold gasket area. Can lead to overheating and loss of coolant.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.

*   **Hard or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh upshifts or downshifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Often requires a transmission rebuild or replacement if the problem is severe. Could potentially be a faulty shift solenoid or pressure switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300+ (solenoid); $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replace)

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Impala, while generally a reliable vehicle, does suffer from some common issues as it ages. Engine issues such as intake manifold gasket and VVT solenoid failures, along with transmission problems like TCC failure, can be costly to repair. Electrical issues and suspension wear are also prevalent. The severity of these issues varies, but addressing them promptly can prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's reliability and value. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or significant body rust repair, can be quite costly.
