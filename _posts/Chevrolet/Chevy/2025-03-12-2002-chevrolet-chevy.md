Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2002 Chevrolet Chevy, categorized by major components and specific engines/transmissions. Please note that obtaining precise repair costs for a vehicle of this age can be challenging due to variations in labor rates, parts availability, and the overall condition of the specific vehicle. The costs provided are estimates based on general industry data and may vary significantly.

The 2002 Chevrolet Chevy, often referring to the Chevy Cavalier and Chevy Prizm models (or potentially other Chevy models depending on your specific focus), was a popular compact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. The Cavalier, in particular, was a common choice. Engine options for the Cavalier included a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 engine producing around 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. The Prizm, being a rebadged Toyota Corolla, primarily featured a 1.8L inline-4 engine. People generally appreciated the Cavalier's simple design and relatively low running costs but disliked its somewhat lackluster interior and driving experience. The Prizm benefited from Toyota's reputation for reliability, however.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4 (Cavalier)**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light. Vacuum leaks can cause the engine to run lean.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, overheating, and visible leaks around the engine. Common leak points are the water pump, thermostat housing, and radiator.
    *   Solution: Identify and replace the leaking component (water pump, thermostat, hoses, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Inline-4 (Prizm)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks, often from the valve cover gasket or rear main seal. Low oil levels and burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, and check engine light. The VVT-i system can become clogged with sludge or experience sensor failures.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the VVT-i components (solenoid, actuator).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Cavalier & Prizm)**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky shifts between gears, particularly 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd. Slipping between gears can also occur.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, internal repairs or a transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) to $1500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, stalling, and poor acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken or Worn Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower on one side, unusual noises over bumps, and poor handling.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet Chevy (Cavalier & Prizm) is prone to a range of issues common in older vehicles. Engine issues such as intake manifold leaks and coolant leaks in the Cavalier or oil leaks and VVT-i problems in the Prizm can lead to moderate repair costs. Transmission problems, especially harsh shifting, are significant concerns. Suspension wear and electrical faults contribute to the overall maintenance burden. Rust is a common problem in some regions. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, making a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing.
