Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2012 Chevrolet Cruze, formatted for your website and adhering to your specific requirements. The 2012 Chevrolet Cruze is a compact car known for its fuel efficiency and relatively comfortable ride. Engine options include a 1.8L naturally aspirated inline-4 (LUW) producing around 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 (LUJ) making about 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were generally paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Cruze's fuel economy, especially with the turbo engine, and its stylish interior. However, common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the turbo engine, as well as some concerns about the automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Cruze is a generally economical compact car. However, it does experience some common issues. The 1.4L turbo engine is prone to PCV system failures and turbocharger problems, while the 1.8L has thermostat housing leak issues. The 6T40 automatic transmission can suffer from harsh shifting. Electrical issues such as battery drain and ignition switch problems are also seen. Interior dashboard cracking can also occur. Repair costs vary, with some fixes being relatively inexpensive, while others, such as turbocharger or transmission replacement, can be quite costly. Many of the engine issues, while not presenting safety risks, can significantly impact performance and reliability. The ignition switch recall does pose a safety hazard.
