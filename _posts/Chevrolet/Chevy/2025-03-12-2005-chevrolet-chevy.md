Okay, here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2005 Chevrolet Chevy vehicles, organized by category and component, following your specified format. Note that the "Chevy" name was applied across many models, so this response will attempt to capture the most common issues across the *most common* models under the Chevrolet brand for that model year. Because of the ambiguity of "Chevy" alone, it's important to cross-reference this information with specific Chevrolet models like the Silverado, Tahoe, Impala, etc., for the most accurate picture.

The 2005 Chevrolet lineup was diverse, offering a range of vehicles from trucks and SUVs to sedans and coupes. Common engine options included the 4.3L V6 (typically in trucks), the 5.3L V8 (trucks and SUVs), the 3.8L V6 (Impala, Monte Carlo), and the 2.2L Inline-4 (Cavalier, Cobalt). Transmissions varied based on the engine and vehicle, with the 4L60E 4-speed automatic being common in trucks and SUVs, and other automatics and manuals in smaller vehicles. Owners generally appreciate the Chevy's reliability and affordability. However, some dislike the fuel economy of the larger engines and the build quality of some interior components.
