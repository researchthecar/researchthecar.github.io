**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak, while a capable and durable medium-duty truck, is prone to certain issues related to its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical, and other systems. Engine issues, particularly with the 6.6L Duramax diesel, can be costly to repair due to fuel injector and turbocharger failures. The Allison transmission, while generally reliable, can suffer from torque converter and shift solenoid problems. Suspension issues, especially leaf spring fatigue and worn ball joints, are common given the vehicle's heavy-duty applications. Electrical issues, like glow plug malfunctions, are also prevalent. The cost of these repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousands for major engine or transmission work, making it crucial for potential buyers to thoroughly inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic. Frame corrosion is a significant concern, especially in areas with road salt usage, potentially leading to extensive and expensive repairs.
