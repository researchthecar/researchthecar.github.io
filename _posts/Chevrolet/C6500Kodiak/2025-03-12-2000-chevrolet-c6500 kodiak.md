The 2000 Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak is a medium-duty truck known for its robustness and versatility, often used in commercial applications. Common engine options included the Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine, as well as the 6.0L Vortec gasoline V8 and the 7.4L Vortec gasoline V8. The Caterpillar 3126 produced around 175-330 horsepower and 420-860 lb-ft of torque, depending on its configuration. Owners appreciate the Kodiak for its reliability in heavy-duty tasks and its relatively simple mechanical design. However, they often dislike the fuel consumption, especially with the gasoline engines, and the general upkeep associated with a commercial vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2000 Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak, while a durable medium-duty truck, can suffer from issues common to vehicles of its age and class. Engine issues, particularly with the Caterpillar 3126 (injector failure, turbo issues, HPOP failure), can be quite costly to repair. Transmission problems, depending on the specific transmission, can also be significant. Suspension and electrical issues, while generally less expensive, can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Rust is a common problem, especially in areas with harsh winters. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor in the cost of repairs when making a purchase. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission work can quickly escalate into major expenses.
