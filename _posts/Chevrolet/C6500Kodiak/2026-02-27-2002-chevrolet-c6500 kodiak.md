### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak is generally a reliable workhorse, especially when equipped with the robust gasoline V8 engines or the well-regarded Allison transmissions. Diesel variants, particularly the early Duramax LB7, can present more complex and costly issues like injector sleeve leaks. Common problems across the platform include potential for rust, especially in harsh climates, and wear on suspension components due to heavy use. Electrical gremlins and HVAC issues are not uncommon but are typically repairable. Proactive maintenance, particularly fluid changes for the transmission and monitoring for diesel-specific issues, is key to maximizing the longevity and reliability of these commercial vehicles.
