**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak, while a capable and reliable medium-duty truck, can be prone to certain issues. The most significant issues revolve around the Duramax diesel engine, particularly fuel injector and HPFP failures, which can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, mainly concerning the torque converter and solenoids, can also occur. Suspension components, specifically leaf springs and front-end components, are subject to wear and tear due to the truck's heavy-duty usage. Electrical gremlins, such as glow plug and wiring harness problems, can also surface. While some issues may be minor, others can lead to substantial repair costs, so buyers should be diligent in inspecting any prospective purchase and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
