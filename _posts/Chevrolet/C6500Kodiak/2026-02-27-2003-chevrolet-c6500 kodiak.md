### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak is a capable work truck with a generally solid reputation for durability, especially when equipped with the diesel engines. The most common issues tend to be related to the powertrain, particularly with fuel injectors and turbochargers on the Caterpillar diesel, and intake manifold gaskets or head gaskets on the gasoline V8s. Transmission issues, while not epidemic, can arise with the Allison 1000, often involving the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear due to the truck's intended use. Electrical gremlins and rust can also be present, especially on higher-mileage units or those operating in harsh environments. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the reliability of these heavy-duty vehicles.
