### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak demonstrates a generally solid reliability profile for its class, with the Duramax and Vortec engines being workhorses. However, common issues like injector problems and EGR cooler failures on the Duramax, and intake manifold gasket leaks on the Vortec, are notable. The Allison transmission is robust but can develop torque converter issues. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, can experience wear and tear under heavy use. Electrical issues like alternator failure are also present. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning the powertrain and cooling systems, is recommended to mitigate potential costly repairs and ensure operational uptime.
