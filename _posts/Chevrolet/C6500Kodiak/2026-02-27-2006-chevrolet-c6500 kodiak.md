### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak demonstrates a generally solid reliability record for its class, with most reported issues stemming from the demanding nature of commercial use or specific component vulnerabilities. The Duramax and Vortec engines, while powerful, can experience issues like injector problems or intake manifold leaks, respectively. The Allison transmissions are robust but can develop torque converter or valve body issues over time. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, are subject to wear and potential breakage under heavy loads. Electrical systems, such as alternators, and exterior elements like rust are also areas to monitor. Interior wear is typical for a work vehicle. Proactive maintenance and addressing issues promptly are key to maximizing the longevity and reliability of the C6500 Kodiak.
