### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak is a capable workhorse with a generally good reliability record, particularly for its intended commercial use. The gasoline 6.0L Vortec V8 and Allison automatic transmissions are known for their durability. However, the diesel engine options, especially the Caterpillar C-7, can present more significant repair needs such as fuel injector and turbocharger issues. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear due to the heavy-duty nature of the truck. Electrical issues, particularly alternator failure and wiring harness problems, can occur. Interior wear, especially on seats and HVAC components, is also noted. Overall, with proper maintenance and attention to specific powertrain weaknesses, the Kodiak can remain a reliable asset.
