**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax LB7 V8**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: LB7 Duramax engines were plagued by injector failures. Symptoms include excessive white smoke, rough idling, poor fuel economy, and fuel in the engine oil. This is caused by cracks in the injector body and/or nozzle erosion.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty injectors. It's often recommended to replace all 8 injectors at once to ensure even fuel delivery and avoid future problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Knock**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LB7 engine has issues with its factory tune, which will cause the injectors to have incorrect fuel timing, causing a loud knocking sound.
    *   Solution: Replace injectors and flash ECU to updated OEM tune or aftermarket tune to correct the injector timing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.2L Caterpillar 3126**
* **High Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 7.2L Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine has been known to have issues with high oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs. This can be caused by worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    * Solution: Perform an engine compression test to assess ring wear. Replace worn piston rings and/or valve stem seals. In severe cases, an engine rebuild may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $8,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 8.1L Vortec engines experienced excessive oil consumption, often due to issues with the valve stem seals or piston rings. This can lead to blue smoke from the exhaust, fouled spark plugs, and decreased engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve stem seals or piston rings can address the oil consumption issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 Series**

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy-duty nature of the C6500 Kodiak, the leaf springs can sag or crack over time, especially under constant heavy loads. This can lead to a rough ride, poor handling, and reduced load capacity.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. It may also be beneficial to upgrade to heavier-duty springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found
