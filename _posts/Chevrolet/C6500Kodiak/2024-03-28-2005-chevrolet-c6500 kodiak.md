**Summary**
While the Chevrolet C6500 Kodiak is a capable and reliable workhorse, it does have a few common issues that owners may encounter. Engine problems, primarily with the Duramax V8, can be expensive to fix. Transmission issues are also a concern, especially with the Allison automatic transmission. Suspension components can wear out prematurely due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical problems can range from minor inconveniences to more significant issues that affect the operation of the vehicle. Interior components may experience failures, such as the dashboard cluster and door lock actuators. The severity of these issues varies, and repair costs can be significant in some cases. Therefore, potential buyers and owners should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their decision-making process.
