The 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt was a compact car offered in coupe and sedan body styles. Engine options included a 2.2L Inline-4 (155 hp, 150 lb-ft torque), a 2.4L Inline-4 (171 hp, 167 lb-ft torque) available on the SS, and a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (260 hp, 260 lb-ft torque) also available on the SS. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Cobalt for its fuel economy and affordability. Common complaints include issues with the electrical system, particularly the power steering, and concerns about interior quality.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-4 (L61)**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall, especially at idle or when decelerating. This can be intermittent and may or may not trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body is often the first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, inspect the mass airflow sensor (MAF) and replace if necessary. In some cases, a faulty crankshaft position sensor can cause stalling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Catalytic Converter**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes indicating catalytic converter inefficiency (e.g., P0420). Reduced fuel economy and potential for failed emissions test.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4 (LE5)**
