The 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt was a compact car offered in coupe and sedan body styles, aiming for fuel efficiency and affordability. The base engine was a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing around 145 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some of the Cobalt's strengths included its decent fuel economy and relatively spacious interior for a compact car. Common complaints often cited build quality, bland styling, and a less-than-refined driving experience.

Electrical problems, particularly with the ignition switch, were significant and subject to recalls. Engine and transmission issues, while not universal, can be costly to repair. Suspension and interior problems, while less severe, can detract from the overall ownership experience. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but overall, the 2005 Cobalt may require more frequent and potentially expensive maintenance compared to some of its competitors.
