The 2023 Chevrolet Onix is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and value. In some markets, it comes with two primary engine options: a 1.0L 3-cylinder engine producing around 116 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.2L 3-cylinder engine that produces around 130 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. These engines are typically paired with either a 6-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission, depending on the specific market and trim level. Owners often appreciate the Onix for its modern styling, comfortable interior for its class, and good fuel economy. Some common dislikes include the relatively small rear seats and the lack of advanced driver-assistance features in base models.
