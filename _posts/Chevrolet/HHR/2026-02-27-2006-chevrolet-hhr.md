### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet HHR is a vehicle with a distinctive style that can be a practical choice if well-maintained. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly timing chain problems in the 2.2L engine and turbocharger concerns in the 2.0L turbo. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can also be costly. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or window regulators, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior wear is typical for its age. Prospective buyers should prioritize vehicles with a documented service history and be prepared for potential repairs related to these known weak points.
