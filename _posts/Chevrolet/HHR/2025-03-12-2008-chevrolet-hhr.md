The 2008 Chevrolet HHR is a retro-styled, four-door wagon/panel van, offering a blend of cargo space and fuel efficiency. Engine options for the 2008 HHR included a 2.2L Inline-4 (149 hp, 152 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.4L Inline-4 (172 hp, 167 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the HHR for its distinctive styling, spacious interior, and good fuel economy. Common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly concerning electrical components, and some find the ride quality to be harsh.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine noise (rattling, especially on startup), rough running, check engine light with codes related to camshaft/crankshaft correlation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Vacuum Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, whistling noise from the engine bay, check engine light with lean codes (P0171, P0174).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gasket, potentially the entire manifold if warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **High Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Needing to add oil frequently between changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, fouled spark plugs.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can reduce oil consumption, but this is a major repair. Other solutions involve switching to a heavier weight oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifts between gears, slipping during acceleration, delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: Could be due to low fluid, worn valve body, or internal damage. Start with a fluid flush and filter change. If that doesn't resolve the issue, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (fluid/filter), $500 - $1500+ (valve body/rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Summary:**

The 2008 Chevrolet HHR, while praised for its styling and utility, faces some common issues, especially concerning the engine, electrical system, and suspension. Engine issues, such as timing chain wear and oil consumption, can be costly to address. Electrical problems, particularly with power windows and the instrument panel, are also frequent. Suspension issues like strut mount failure affect ride quality and handling. While not all HHRs will experience all these issues, being aware of these potential problems can help buyers make informed decisions and budget for potential repairs. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but addressing these issues promptly can prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's reliability.
