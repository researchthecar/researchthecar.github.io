### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet HHR presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly oil consumption and timing chain noise in the naturally aspirated engines, and turbocharger issues in the 2.0L turbo variant. Automatic transmission problems like harsh shifting and torque converter issues are also noted. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, can manifest in various ways. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may require attention as the vehicle ages. Exterior rust on lower body panels and interior issues such as blend door actuators and power window regulators are also areas to inspect. Despite these potential concerns, many HHRs provide reliable service when properly maintained, with many issues being addressable with moderate repair costs.
