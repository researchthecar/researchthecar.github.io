The 2006 Chevrolet HHR (Heritage High Roof) is a compact, retro-styled wagon. It was available with two engine options: a 2.2L Ecotec I4 producing 143 hp and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Ecotec I4 producing 172 hp and 167 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often liked the HHR's distinctive styling, spacious cargo area, and fuel economy. Common dislikes included its relatively weak performance, especially with the 2.2L engine, and some reliability issues.
