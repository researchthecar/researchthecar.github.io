### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet HHR presents a mixed reliability profile. While some engine options, particularly the 2.2L, and the manual transmission are generally robust, owners may encounter issues with the 2.4L engine's oil consumption and timing chain, and the turbocharger on the 2.0L variant. Automatic transmission problems like harsh shifting are not uncommon. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and power windows, can be frustrating. Exterior rust and interior wear are also points to consider. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs, especially for higher-mileage examples.
