The 2011 Chevrolet HHR (High Heritage Roof) is a retro-styled, compact wagon known for its spacious cargo area and distinctive design. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 generating 172 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the HHR's fuel efficiency, cargo capacity, and unique styling. However, common complaints include a somewhat cheap interior, road noise, and some reliability issues, especially in earlier model years.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be due to worn piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: A compression test can help diagnose the cause. If rings are worn, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary. If valve seals are the culprit, they can be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially in colder weather. This may indicate a stretched timing chain or worn timing chain guides. If left unaddressed, it can lead to engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.2L, some 2.4L engines experience excessive oil consumption due to piston ring or valve seal wear.
    *   Solution: Same as 2.2L, compression test, engine rebuild or replacement, or valve seal replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially in colder weather. This may indicate a stretched timing chain or worn timing chain guides. If left unaddressed, it can lead to engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly. Can be caused by worn internal components, low fluid level, or a malfunctioning valve body.
    *   Solution: Check fluid level and condition. If the fluid is dark or smells burnt, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may help. If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. This can be caused by worn-out rear coil springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clunking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking sounds from the front or rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn sway bar links, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspection of suspension components and replacement of worn parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows or door locks. This can be caused by faulty window/door lock switches, wiring problems, or a failing door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific problem and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Panel Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges not working properly, dim display, or intermittent power loss to the instrument panel. This can be caused by a faulty instrument cluster or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the instrument cluster or repair of damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Hinge Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors that sag, creak, or are difficult to close properly. This is often caused by worn door hinge pins and bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door hinge pins and bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner detaches from the roof of the vehicle and begins to sag. This is more common in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Chevrolet HHR has a mix of mechanical and electrical issues that owners should be aware of. Engine-related issues such as excessive oil consumption and timing chain problems can be costly to repair, while suspension and electrical issues are generally less expensive. Overall, while the HHR offers a unique design and practicality, potential buyers should be prepared for potential maintenance and repair costs, especially as these vehicles age. The severity of the issues range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures. The cost to address these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem.
