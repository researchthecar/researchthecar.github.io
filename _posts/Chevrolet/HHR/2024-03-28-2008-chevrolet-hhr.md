**Introduction:**

The 2008 Chevrolet HHR is a retro-styled station wagon that offers a unique blend of style and practicality. It was available with three engine options and two transmission choices. The base engine was a 2.2L Ecotec I4, which produced 149 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.4L Ecotec I4 was also available, generating 172 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. For those seeking even more power, a 2.0L turbocharged Ecotec I4 was offered, producing 260 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual transmission and a 4-speed automatic transmission.

Drivers appreciate the HHR's spacious interior, versatile seating arrangements, and retro-inspired design. However, it has received criticism for its cramped rear seats, limited cargo capacity, and subpar fuel economy.
