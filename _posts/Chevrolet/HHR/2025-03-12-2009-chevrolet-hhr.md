The 2009 Chevrolet HHR is a retro-styled, compact wagon known for its distinctive appearance and surprising practicality. Engine options for the 2009 HHR included a 2.2L Inline-4 engine producing around 149 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L Inline-4 engine producing around 172 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. Both engines came standard with a 5-speed manual transmission, while a 4-speed automatic transmission was optional. Owners generally appreciate the HHR's ample cargo space and fuel efficiency for its class. However, some common complaints include concerns about the reliability of certain components, particularly in the electrical and engine systems, and the overall build quality.

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet HHR can be a practical and stylish choice, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly timing chain wear in the 2.4L engine and catalytic converter problems in the 2.2L, can be costly to repair. Electrical glitches, often traced to the ignition switch or BCM, are also frequent. Suspension and exterior issues like rust contribute to the overall cost of ownership. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars. Careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended.
