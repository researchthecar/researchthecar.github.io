Here is a breakdown of common problems reported by owners of the 2007 Chevrolet HHR. The HHR, or Heritage High Roof, was a retro-styled wagon that offered practicality and fuel efficiency. The 2007 model came with two engine options: a 2.2L inline-4 producing around 143 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 generating approximately 172 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the HHR's cargo space and unique styling. Common dislikes include its somewhat underpowered engines and certain reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual or rapid loss of engine oil, often accompanied by blue exhaust smoke and a need to frequently add oil. May be caused by worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected piston rings or valve stem seals. In severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Throttle Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may idle roughly, stall, or hesitate during acceleration. The throttle body may become dirty and clogged, leading to improper airflow.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body with throttle body cleaner is often a first step. If the problem persists, the throttle body may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $100 (cleaning) or $200 - $400 (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Camshaft Actuator Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced engine power, and potential check engine light with codes related to camshaft position. The camshaft actuator solenoid controls oil flow to the camshaft phasers.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft actuator solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. Can lead to poor engine performance and potential engine damage if left unresolved. The timing chain can stretch or the tensioners can fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting between gears, rough or jerky shifts, and/or the transmission slipping out of gear. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, low transmission fluid, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement might resolve minor issues. More severe problems might require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid/filter) or $800 - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. May also experience poor handling. The strut mounts support the struts and allow them to pivot.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (for both sides)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may operate slowly, erratically, or not at all. The window regulator mechanism can fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Switch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the vehicle, stalling, or the car turning off unexpectedly. This is related to a faulty ignition switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminated on the dashboard. Intermittent braking or issues with the ABS engaging.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can form around the license plate and on the seam at the bottom of the rear hatch.
    *   Solution: Sanding down the rust and repainting or replacing the hatch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fabric headliner can detach from the roof and start to sag.
    *   Solution: Re-gluing the headliner fabric or replacing the entire headliner board.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet HHR, while appreciated for its unique styling and cargo capacity, is known to have some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with oil consumption in the 2.2L and timing chain issues in the 2.4L, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, while not always severe, can lead to expensive repairs. Other common problems like electrical faults and suspension issues contribute to the overall ownership experience. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to significant repair bills, potentially making it important for prospective buyers to carefully inspect the vehicle and factor in potential maintenance costs.
