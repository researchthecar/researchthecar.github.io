Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2010 Chevrolet HHR, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2010 Chevrolet HHR is a retro-styled, compact, high-roof vehicle that aimed to blend the practicality of a small wagon with classic Chevrolet design cues. Two primary engine options were available: a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing around 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 generating approximately 172 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the HHR's cargo space, fuel economy (for its class), and distinctive styling. Criticisms tend to focus on the somewhat lackluster interior materials, handling characteristics, and reports of certain mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec I4**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine rattling, especially on startup. Can also lead to poor performance and eventually engine damage if the chain stretches or breaks. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to camshaft/crankshaft correlation may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, difficulty starting, and potentially poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the purge solenoid valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Ecotec I4**

*   **High Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably decreasing oil levels between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may indicate burning oil.
    *   Solution: In some cases, piston ring replacement is necessary to correct the issue. Other potential causes should be ruled out first (e.g., valve stem seals, PCV valve).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500 (ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Actuator Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light. DTCs related to camshaft position may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft actuator solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (4T45E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, transmission slipping (engine revving without proportional acceleration), and potential transmission error codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of faulty solenoids, valve body components, or potentially a full transmission rebuild or replacement if internal damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (solenoid) - $3500+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and uneven tire wear can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts. In some cases, it's recommended to replace the struts as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700 (per side, including struts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded. This can affect handling and ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Ignition Switch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, loss of electrical power, and potential for the key to be removed while the engine is running.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: Some 2010 HHR models may be affected by GM ignition switch recalls, *check VIN with the NHTSA for applicability. Recall number is 14V047000.

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows not functioning properly (slow, erratic, or not moving at all).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (per window)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening the rear liftgate or inability to open it at all. The handle mechanism may break or become corroded.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate handle assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues (If Equipped)**

**Summary**

The 2010 Chevrolet HHR, while offering a unique retro aesthetic and decent practicality, is prone to a range of issues. Engine problems such as timing chain issues and high oil consumption can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can also lead to significant expenses. Electrical problems like ignition switch failures and power window malfunctions are relatively common. Suspension components, especially the front strut mounts, are susceptible to wear and tear. While some issues like the ignition switch problem were subject to recalls, many others require out-of-pocket repairs. The severity of these potential problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended for prospective buyers.
