### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Chevrolet Cargo Van, particularly those equipped with the 4.3L V6 or 5.0L/5.7L V8 engines, can be a reliable choice if well-maintained. Common issues tend to revolve around intake manifold gaskets, and for the V8s, potential head gasket or oil cooler line leaks. The 4L60-E transmission is more prone to issues like torque converter problems than the robust 4L80-E. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to heavy use. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and exterior rust are also points to consider. Overall, addressing these potential issues proactively can ensure continued serviceability for this commercial vehicle.
