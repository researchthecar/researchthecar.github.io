### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Cargo Van presents a mixed reliability profile. While the robust Vortec V8 engines are generally durable, they can be susceptible to issues like Active Fuel Management problems. The V6 variant is more straightforward but can suffer from intake manifold leaks. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4L60-E, have known solenoid issues that can impact drivability. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to the van's typical heavy usage. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM or alternator, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, regular maintenance and prompt attention to reported issues are crucial for maintaining the operational integrity of these work vehicles.
