### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet Cargo Van is a robust vehicle for its intended purpose, but like many vans of this era, it is susceptible to certain age-related issues. The most commonly reported problems revolve around the engine's intake manifold gaskets and, for V8 models, potential head gasket issues. Automatic transmission problems, particularly with the torque converter clutch and solenoids, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out, and electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. Rust can be a significant concern depending on the climate. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these common wear points and age-related degradation.
