The 2.8L Duramax diesel, while offering more power, has a few documented issues related to the turbocharger and EGR system that owners should be aware of. Transmission reliability is decent, though some instances of harsh shifting in the automatic variant have been noted. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon for vehicles of this age and can require attention. Overall, the Tornado is a practical choice, but potential buyers, especially of the diesel variant, should consider these specific technical points. Regular maintenance remains key to mitigating most potential problems.
