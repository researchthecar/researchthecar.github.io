The 2007 Chevrolet Tornado is a subcompact pickup truck, also known as the Chevrolet Montana in some markets, primarily sold in Latin America and other emerging markets. It's essentially a pickup version of the Chevrolet Corsa. The most common engine option for the 2007 Tornado is a 1.8L 8V SOHC inline-four gasoline engine, producing approximately 105 horsepower and 119 lb-ft of torque. This engine was typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Tornado's fuel efficiency, affordability, and practicality for light hauling. However, they often dislike its relatively low power output, basic interior features, and ride quality.
