**Introduction:**

The 2015 Chevrolet Tornado, a compact pickup truck, was offered with two engine options: a 2.5L I-4 and a 3.6L V6, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5L engine produced 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.6L engine generated 305 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Despite its sporty exterior, the Tornado received generally positive reviews, with praises for its powerful engines, responsive handling, and spacious interior.
