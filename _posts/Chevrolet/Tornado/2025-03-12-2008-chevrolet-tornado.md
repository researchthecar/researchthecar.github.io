The 2008 Chevrolet Tornado is a compact pickup truck primarily sold in Mexico and Latin America. It's based on the Chevrolet Corsa platform. The 2008 Tornado generally came with a 1.8L inline-4 engine, producing around 105 horsepower and 119 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission was the standard offering. Owners often appreciate the Tornado for its fuel efficiency, practicality, and affordable price point. Common dislikes include its relatively low power output, basic interior, and limited cargo capacity compared to larger trucks.
