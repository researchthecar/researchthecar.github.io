## 2011 Chevrolet Tornado

The 2011 Chevrolet Tornado is a compact pickup truck that was only sold in the South American market. It was available with a single engine option: a 1.4-liter inline-four engine that produces 97 horsepower and 95 lb-ft of torque. The Tornado was offered with either a five-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission.

People like the Tornado for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability. However, it has been criticized for its lack of power, poor ride quality, and cramped interior.

## Engine

**1.4L Inline-Four Engine**

* **Oil leaks from camshaft cover:** Oil leaking from the camshaft cover can cause the engine to run low on oil, which can lead to premature engine wear. The camshaft cover gasket must be replaced to fix the leak. The cost of the repair varies depending on the labor rate, but it typically costs between $100 and $200.

## Transmission

**Five-Speed Manual Transmission:**

* **Difficulty shifting gears:** Some owners have reported difficulty shifting gears in the five-speed manual transmission. The issue is usually caused by worn or damaged shift cables. Replacing the shift cables can cost between $200 and $400.

**Six-Speed Automatic Transmission:**

* **No issues found**

## Suspension

* **Rear leaf springs sag:** The rear leaf springs on the Tornado can sag over time, which can lead to a decrease in ride height and a loss of stability. Replacing the leaf springs costs between $400 and $600.
* **Front struts worn:** The front struts on the Tornado can wear out over time, which can lead to a decrease in ride quality and handling. Replacing the front struts costs between $600 and $800.

## Electrical

* **Battery shorts:** The battery may sometimes short out, causing problems with the electrical system. Replacing the battery costs between $100 and $200.

## Exterior

* **Door handles break:** The door handles on the Tornado can break easily, making it difficult to open the doors. Replacing a door handle costs between $50 and $100.
* **Tailgate latch fails:** The tailgate latch can fail on the Tornado, making it difficult to open or close the tailgate. Replacing the tailgate latch costs between $100 and $200.

## Interior

* **Interior trim pieces rattle:** The interior trim pieces on the Tornado can rattle over rough roads. The rattles can be fixed by tightening the trim pieces or using sound deadening material. The cost of the repair varies depending on the materials used.

## Summary

The 2011 Chevrolet Tornado is a budget-friendly pickup truck that has a few common issues. The most severe issues are the oil leaks from the camshaft cover and the rear leaf springs sagging. The other issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix. Overall, the Tornado is a decent choice for those who need a basic pickup truck for light-duty tasks.
