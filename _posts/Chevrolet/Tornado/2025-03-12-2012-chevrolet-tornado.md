The 2012 Chevrolet Tornado is a light-duty pickup truck primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets. The 2012 model typically came with a 1.8L inline-four engine, producing around 105 horsepower and 119 lb-ft of torque. It was generally favored for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and utility as a small work truck, but disliked for its basic features and relatively low power. Key complaints often revolve around its lack of modern amenities, ride quality, and limited safety features.

**Engine**
