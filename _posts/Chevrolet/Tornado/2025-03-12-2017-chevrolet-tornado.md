The 2017 Chevrolet Tornado, also known as the Chevrolet Montana in some markets, is a compact pickup truck primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries. It's known for its practicality, affordability, and fuel efficiency, making it a popular choice for small businesses and personal use. While not available in the United States, it's still a relevant vehicle in its target markets. The 2017 model typically comes with a 1.6-liter inline-four engine producing around 103 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise its compact size for navigating tight city streets and its decent cargo capacity for light-duty work. Common dislikes include its relatively basic interior and lack of advanced features compared to larger pickup trucks.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-Four Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. The low oil light can turn on intermittently, even with no visible leaks.
    *   Solution: Initially, owners should check for any external leaks around the valve cover, oil pan, and rear main seal. A compression test and leak-down test should be performed to identify potential internal issues, such as worn piston rings or valve stem seals. If the rings or seals are damaged, the engine may require an overhaul or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (for leak repair) - $2000+ (for engine overhaul or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminates, often accompanied by OBD codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420). Reduced fuel economy and potential loss of power.
    * Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. It's also crucial to diagnose the root cause of the failure (e.g., rich running condition, oil consumption) to prevent premature failure of the new converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or resistance when shifting into certain gears, particularly 1st or 2nd. Could also include popping out of gear.
    *   Solution: Inspect the shift linkage for wear or damage and adjust or replace as necessary. If the issue persists, inspect the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing for wear. Replacement of the clutch components may be required. In some cases, internal transmission damage could be the cause, requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (for linkage repair) $300 - $1200+ (for clutch replacement or transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Possible uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Inspect the ball joints, tie rod ends, and sway bar links for wear or looseness. Replace worn components as needed. A front-end alignment should be performed after replacing any steering or suspension parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the number of components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Motor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window motor fails to operate. The window doesnâ€™t move up or down, or moves slowly and erratically.
    *   Solution: Test window motor with a multimeter. If the motor is bad, replace it with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS or Wheel Speed Sensor)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminates on the dashboard. Diagnostic trouble codes indicating a faulty ABS or wheel speed sensor. The ABS system may not function properly during braking.
    *   Solution: Scan the ABS system for diagnostic trouble codes to identify the faulty sensor. Replace the sensor. Check the wiring harness and connector for damage or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the undercarriage, especially in regions with harsh winters or coastal environments.
    *   Solution: Apply rust inhibitor coating. The best defense is to pressure wash the undercarriage and reapply rust inhibitor coating on an annual basis.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the extent of the rust and the repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard surface, particularly in regions with high temperatures and prolonged sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Apply dashboard protectant and parking in shaded areas can help prevent further cracking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Tornado can have some issues with oil consumption, catalytic converter failures, difficulty shifting the manual transmission, and premature suspension wear. Electrical issues such as window motor failures and faulty sensors may arise. Exterior rust can be a problem, especially in harsh climates, and interior dashboard cracking is possible due to sun exposure. The severity of these issues varies, with engine and transmission problems potentially leading to more costly repairs. Addressing issues promptly through regular maintenance can help prevent more significant damage.
