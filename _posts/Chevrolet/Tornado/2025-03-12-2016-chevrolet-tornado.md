The 2016 Chevrolet Tornado, also known as the Montana in some markets, is a compact pickup truck popular in Mexico and other Latin American countries. It's known for its fuel efficiency, practicality, and affordability. While not sold in the United States, it fills a niche for those needing a light-duty truck. The 2016 Tornado is primarily equipped with a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine producing around 105 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. It is generally paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its reliability, low running costs, and ease of handling in urban environments. Criticisms frequently target its limited cargo capacity compared to larger trucks and its relatively basic interior features.

**Engine**

**1.8L 4-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present, indicating burning oil.
    *   Solution: A common fix involves replacing the piston rings, valve seals, or, in severe cases, the entire engine. A compression test can help determine the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and diagnostic codes related to the oxygen sensors (O2 sensors) are triggered. The engine may run rough, have poor fuel economy, or fail emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty O2 sensor(s) is the standard solution. Ensure the replacement sensor is compatible with the 2016 Chevrolet Tornado.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported difficulty engaging certain gears, particularly 1st and reverse. Grinding noises may also be present during shifts.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include adjusting the clutch cable, replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, or throw-out bearing. Inspecting the shift linkage for wear or damage is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: First, ensure the transmission fluid is at the correct level and is clean. If the issue persists, a transmission flush and filter change might help. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild could be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and reduced ride comfort. Visible oil leaks from the shock absorbers/struts may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn shock absorbers or struts is the standard remedy. It is generally recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery frequently dies, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for a short period. Starting the vehicle may be difficult or impossible.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws by testing the current draw when the vehicle is off. Identify and repair the source of the draw. Replacing the battery may also be necessary if it's damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Window Regulator**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows will not roll up or down. Audible grinding or clicking noises are heard when attempting to operate the window.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window regulator is the standard fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting around wheel wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust developing around wheel wells. Over time, the rust can eat through the metal and create holes.
    *   Solution: Minor surface rust can be sanded and painted. More severe rust requires cutting out the affected area and welding in new metal before painting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air, or no air at all. The compressor may not engage, or the refrigerant may be low.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the failure (e.g., refrigerant leak, faulty compressor, clogged condenser). Repair the leak, replace the faulty component, and recharge the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Tornado, while generally reliable, can experience issues like excessive oil consumption and transmission problems, which can lead to moderate to high repair costs. Electrical glitches and suspension wear are also potential concerns. Overall, addressing these common issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's performance and longevity. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these possibilities.
