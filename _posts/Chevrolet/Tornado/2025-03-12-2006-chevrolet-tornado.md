The 2006 Chevrolet Tornado, also known as the Chevrolet Montana in some markets, is a small pickup truck primarily sold in Latin America. It was based on the Chevrolet Corsa platform. The 2006 model year typically featured a 1.8L inline-4 engine, producing around 105 horsepower and 119 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission.
