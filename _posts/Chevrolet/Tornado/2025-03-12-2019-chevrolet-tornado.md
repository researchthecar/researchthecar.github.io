The 2019 Chevrolet Tornado, also known as the Chevrolet Montana in some markets, is a compact pickup truck primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries. It is powered by a 1.8L inline 4-cylinder engine producing approximately 105 horsepower and 119 lb-ft of torque. This engine is typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its practicality, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Common dislikes include its basic features, modest power, and limited availability of parts in some regions.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes. Owners may notice a burning oil smell, blue smoke from the exhaust, and low oil levels on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings may reduce oil consumption. If the issue persists, a more extensive engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Evaporative Emission Control System (EVAP) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) illumination, commonly associated with EVAP system leak codes (e.g., P0440, P0455). Owners may not experience any noticeable drivability issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair leaks in the EVAP system, which could involve replacing the fuel cap, charcoal canister, vent valve, or purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or delayed shifts, especially between certain gears. Some owners have reported slipping or difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, repairs to the valve body, solenoids, or clutches may be necessary. A full transmission rebuild or replacement could be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension components such as struts, shocks, and bushings, particularly in areas with rough road conditions. This can lead to a bumpy ride, excessive noise, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts, shocks, and bushings. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty components if operating frequently in challenging conditions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains caused by faulty accessories or electrical components. A load test of the battery and alternator is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the undercarriage, especially in areas with harsh winter conditions or near the ocean.
    *   Solution: Applying rust-proofing coatings and regularly washing the undercarriage can prevent rust. For existing rust, it needs to be mechanically removed and recoated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,000+ depending on the extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may blow warm air or fail to cool effectively. This can be due to refrigerant leaks, a faulty compressor, or a clogged condenser.
    *   Solution: Inspect the air conditioning system for leaks, and repair or replace faulty components. Recharge the refrigerant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Tornado exhibits some common issues, primarily related to the engine (oil consumption, EVAP), transmission (harsh shifting), and suspension (premature wear). While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more costly, such as engine or transmission repairs. The severity of these issues can vary depending on the vehicle's maintenance history, driving conditions, and geographical location. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
