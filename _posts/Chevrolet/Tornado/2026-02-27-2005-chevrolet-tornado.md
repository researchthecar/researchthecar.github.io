### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Tornado presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline 2.4L engine is generally solid, though intake manifold leaks and oil pressure sensor issues are noted. The 2.8L Duramax diesel, while offering good torque, is more prone to issues with glow plugs and the turbocharger, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmission torque converter issues are a common concern. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out, especially under heavy use. Electrical issues, particularly with the alternator and power windows, are also reported. Overall, the Tornado can be a dependable workhorse if well-maintained, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific potential failure points, especially concerning the diesel engine and automatic transmission.
