Alright, here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2013 Chevrolet Tornado, based on available information. Keep in mind that specific data on the Tornado can be more limited than for vehicles sold widely in North America.

The 2013 Chevrolet Tornado is a compact pickup truck (coupe utility) primarily sold in Mexico and Latin America. The most common engine is a 1.8L 4-cylinder gasoline engine producing around 105 horsepower and 119 lb-ft of torque. The Tornado is generally appreciated for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Common complaints often revolve around its relatively basic features, less refined interior, and sometimes, parts availability in regions outside of its primary markets. It's a work truck, not a luxury vehicle, so expectations should be set accordingly.

**Engine**

**1.8L 4-Cylinder Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups. This can manifest as a low oil light illuminating, or noticing a significant decrease in oil level on the dipstick between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Check for leaks first. If no leaks, possible repairs include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or, in severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illuminated check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420). Decreased engine performance, reduced fuel economy, and potential failure to pass emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Ensure the underlying cause of the failure (e.g., engine running rich) is addressed to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the truck sits noticeably lower than the front, especially when carrying a load. This can lead to reduced ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if frequently carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
