### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a reasonably reliable vehicle, especially when equipped with the more common V6 engines. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the intake manifold gaskets on V6 models and the torque converter solenoid on the 4T65E transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM, can be a concern but are not universal. Exterior rust is a common issue for vehicles of this age, especially in harsher climates. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known potential problems, the Monte Carlo can provide dependable service.
