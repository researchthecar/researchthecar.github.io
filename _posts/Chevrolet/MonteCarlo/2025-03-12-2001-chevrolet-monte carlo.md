The 2001 Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a front-wheel drive coupe that was popular for its sporty styling and comfortable ride. It offered two engine options: a 3.4L V6 producing 180 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Monte Carlo's smooth ride and attractive design but often cited issues with reliability and certain electrical components.
