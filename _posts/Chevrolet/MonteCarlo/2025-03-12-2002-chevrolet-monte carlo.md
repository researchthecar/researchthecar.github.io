The 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a front-wheel-drive coupe known for its comfortable ride and distinctive styling. It was available with two engine options: a 3.4L LA1 V6 engine producing around 180 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L L36 V6 engine producing around 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the 4T65-E 4-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Monte Carlo for its smooth ride, spacious interior for a coupe, and relatively affordable price point. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated styling, the lack of a manual transmission option, and some reliability concerns.
