The V6 engines, especially the 3.8L, can be prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and, less commonly, head gasket issues. Transmission problems, primarily with the 4T65-E, often involve the torque converter. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and alternator failures are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, addressing these potential issues proactively can lead to a satisfying ownership experience.
