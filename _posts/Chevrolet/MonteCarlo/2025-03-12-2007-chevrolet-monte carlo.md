The 2007 Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a front-wheel-drive coupe known for its comfortable ride and distinctive styling. Engine options included a 3.5L V6 (211 hp, 214 lb-ft of torque), a 3.9L V6 (233 hp, 240 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.3L V8 (303 hp, 323 lb-ft of torque) specifically for the SS model. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Monte Carlo's spacious interior and smooth handling, but some common complaints include issues with the electrical system and certain engine components.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (LZ4)**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, coolant leaks, and potential overheating. Can cause a check engine light to illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600

**3.9L V6 (LZ9)**

*   **Valve Train Noise (Lifter Tick)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise coming from the engine, especially at idle or low RPMs. May be caused by worn or collapsed lifters.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ (depending on the extent of the damage and if other valve train components need replacement)
*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, rough idling, and potential stalling. The check engine light may illuminate with codes related to the VVT system.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty VVT solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**5.3L V8 (LS4)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, and a check engine light. The issue often stems from the AFM lifters collapsing, leading to cylinder deactivation problems.
    *   Solution: Replace the AFM lifters (often with non-AFM lifters to prevent future issues). Some people will complete a full AFM delete.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ (including labor, as it is an involved repair).

**Transmission**

**4T65-E (All Engines)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or jerky shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. This is often due to wear in the valve body, worn clutches, or issues with the pressure control solenoid.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission, or repair/replace the valve body and/or pressure control solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000 (valve body/solenoid repair) to $2000 - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also lead to uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (per pair)

*   **Rear Coil Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably lower rear ride height, especially when carrying passengers or cargo. May also affect handling and ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**Electrical**

*   **Ignition Switch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting issues, stalling, or complete failure to start. This was a common problem across many GM vehicles from this era.
    *   Solution: Replace the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: *Recall Number: 06V093000*

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window moves slowly, erratically, or not at all. Grinding noises may be heard when operating the window.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (per window)
*   **Headlight Bulb Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights stop working frequently and often need to be replaced.
    *   Solution: Replace the headlight bulbs
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Outer door handles breaking or becoming detached, making it difficult or impossible to open the doors. This is a common issue with GM vehicles of this era.
    *   Solution: Replace the door handles.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (per handle)

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sun visors become loose and droop down, obstructing the driver's view. The visor may also break at the pivot point.
    *   Solution: Replace the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (per visor)
*   **Information Center (DIC) Display Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Driver Information Center display in the instrument cluster becomes dim, unreadable, or stops working altogether.
    *   Solution: Replace the instrument cluster or repair the DIC display.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (for repair) to $300 - $600+ (for replacement)

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Monte Carlo faces common issues with its engine, transmission, electrical system, suspension, interior and exterior components. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Engine problems like intake manifold gasket failure, lifter tick, and AFM lifter failure can lead to performance issues and costly repairs. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4T65-E, can result in slipping or harsh shifting, requiring significant investment for repair or replacement. Electrical issues such as ignition switch and power window regulator failures are also frequent and can impact the vehicle's reliability. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to address, others, like engine or transmission overhauls, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase.
