The 2016 Chevrolet Spark Classic, also known as the Chevrolet Spark in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It was offered with a 1.2-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 81 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) were available. Owners often appreciate the Spark's small size, making it easy to maneuver and park in urban environments. However, its limited cargo space and relatively weak engine performance are commonly cited as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**1.2L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may exhibit rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and the check engine light may illuminate with codes related to misfires (e.g., P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304). This can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s), spark plugs, or fuel injector(s). Diagnosing and repairing vacuum leaks can also resolve misfires.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the number of coils, injectors, and spark plugs replaced
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant levels drop rapidly, causing overheating, white smoke coming from the exhaust. Check engine light could be on.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking coolant components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the number of coils, injectors, and spark plugs replaced
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Transmission Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT may exhibit jerky movements, hesitation, or shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can be caused by degraded transmission fluid, worn internal components, or issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT fluid with the correct type. In more severe cases, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid change, $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: High RPMs but low speed. Engine revs but the car moves very slowly, or not at all. Transmission warning light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace transmission fluid, inspect for leaks, replace transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid change, $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
