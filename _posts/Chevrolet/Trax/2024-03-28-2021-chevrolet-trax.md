**Introduction**

The 2021 Chevrolet Trax is a subcompact SUV available with two engine options: a 1.4L Turbocharged 4-cylinder engine paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission and a 1.8L 4-cylinder engine paired with either a 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission. The 1.4L engine produces 155 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.8L engine produces 140 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. The Trax is praised for its fuel efficiency, compact size, and affordable price tag. However, it receives criticism for its lack of interior space, underpowered engine, and underwhelming handling.

**Engine**

    * **Slipping Gears:** The transmission may slip out of gear, especially during acceleration or shifting. The transmission fluid and filter should be inspected and changed if necessary. The transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    * **Shift Solenoid Failure:** The shift solenoids may fail, causing harsh or delayed shifting, increased transmission temperatures, and potential damage. The shift solenoids must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200
