The 2013 Chevrolet Trax marked the first year of the subcompact SUV in the North American market. It was generally praised for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and ease of parking in urban environments. However, it was often criticized for its underpowered engine, basic interior, and somewhat cramped rear seats. The sole engine option for the 2013 Trax in North America was a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine, producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
