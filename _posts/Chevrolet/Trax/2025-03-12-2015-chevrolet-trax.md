The 2015 Chevrolet Trax is a subcompact SUV that was introduced to the US market for the first time in 2015. All trims of the 2015 Trax come equipped with a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Trax's maneuverability and fuel efficiency, especially in urban environments. However, common complaints include a lack of power, a somewhat cramped interior, and reported issues with reliability, particularly concerning the engine and transmission.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbocharger, loss of power, check engine light. This can be due to oil starvation or a failing wastegate actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect oil lines and change oil regularly to prevent future failures. Check and replace the wastegate actuator if the turbocharger is still in good shape.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant level, overheating, sweet smell under the hood, visible coolant leak (often around the water pump or thermostat housing).
    *   Solution: Locate and repair the source of the leak. Replace the water pump, thermostat, or hoses as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, check engine light, oil leaks, increased oil consumption. A failed PCV valve can cause excessive pressure buildup in the crankcase.
    *   Solution: Replace the PCV valve or PCV valve assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough idle, whistling sound. Often occurs due to the plastic manifold material becoming brittle.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T40)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during gear changes, jerky shifts, transmission slipping, RPMs flaring between gears, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the entire transmission may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid/filter) - $3500+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially when accelerating, stalling, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially over bumps, uneven tire wear, poor handling.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn components such as struts, shocks, control arms, ball joints, and sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the specific components needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle failing to start, especially after sitting for a short period, dead battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw to identify the source of the drain. Common causes include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, inaccurate sensor readings (e.g., temperature, fuel level), erratic behavior.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, audio cutting out.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on body panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: rust forming on the seams of the vehicle or lower rocker panels
    *   Solution: Cut out the rusted section and weld in a new section. Repaint the section to match.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioner blowing warm air, reduced cooling performance.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Trax, while appreciated for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, has several reported issues. Engine and transmission problems, including turbocharger failure, coolant leaks, harsh shifting, and slipping, appear to be the most prevalent and potentially costly. Electrical issues and suspension component wear are also common. The severity of these problems ranges from minor sensor malfunctions to major engine or transmission replacements. Depending on the specific issue and required repairs, owners can expect to spend anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars to maintain and repair their vehicles.
