The 2021 Chevrolet Trax is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city dwellers. It is only available with a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its ease of parking and fuel efficiency, but some dislike its smaller cargo space and somewhat underpowered engine. Common complaints revolve around the vehicle's acceleration and overall refinement compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4 (LUJ/LUV)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, the low oil pressure light illuminating, and potentially engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: A revised PCV valve or valve cover may be required. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for PCV valve replacement, $2,000 - $4,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the turbocharger, including a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling), and the check engine light illuminating. The turbocharger wastegate actuator or the turbocharger itself could be faulty.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger system to determine the source of the problem. Replacement of the wastegate actuator, turbocharger, or related components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ for wastegate actuator replacement, $800 - $1,500+ for turbocharger replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T40)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Transmission slipping, delayed engagement, and unusual noises (clunking or whining) may also be present.
    *   Solution: A software update for the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve some shifting issues. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission may be required, potentially leading to valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for TCM reprogramming, $500 - $1,200+ for valve body replacement, $2,500 - $5,000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have noted that the suspension components such as the struts, shocks, ball joints, and tie rod ends can wear out prematurely, especially on vehicles driven on rough roads. Symptoms include clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn suspension components with new parts. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty parts if the vehicle is frequently driven on rough roads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 per corner (depending on which components need to be replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Trax, while affordable, has its share of potential issues. Engine concerns, especially related to oil consumption and the turbocharger, can lead to moderate to expensive repairs. The transmission can also present problems with shifting, potentially leading to costly repairs as well. Electrical and suspension issues are less prevalent but still worth noting. While the Trax remains a budget-friendly option, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when making their decision.
