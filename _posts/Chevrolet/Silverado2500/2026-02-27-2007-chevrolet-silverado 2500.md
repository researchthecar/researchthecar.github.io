### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a capable truck, but like many vehicles of its era, it is not without its potential issues. The Duramax diesel engines, while powerful, can be prone to injector and EGR cooler problems. Gasoline V8s may face intake manifold leaks and AFM-related lifter issues. Transmission reliability is generally good, but torque converter shudder and overheating can occur. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items on heavy-duty trucks. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM, and rust are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and addressing issues promptly are key to maintaining the longevity and reliability of this workhorse.
