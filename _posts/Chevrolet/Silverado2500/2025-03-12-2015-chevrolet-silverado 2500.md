The 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Available engine options included a 6.0L Vortec V8 (gasoline) producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.6L Duramax V8 turbo-diesel producing 397 horsepower and 765 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed Allison automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the truck's robust performance, towing capacity, and comfortable ride for a heavy-duty vehicle. Common dislikes include fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), some interior material quality concerns, and certain reliability issues.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (Gasoline)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, and potential engine damage. This is related to the AFM system which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifters can fail and cause damage to the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters, camshaft, and potentially other damaged components. AFM delete kits are also a common solution, disabling the AFM system to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and if an AFM delete is performed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs. This can be caused by piston ring issues or valve seal leaks.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include replacing the piston rings, valve seals, or the entire engine, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax V8 (Diesel)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure (LML Engine)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, white smoke from the exhaust, and reduced fuel economy. The LML Duramax (used in the 2015 Silverado 2500HD) is known for injector issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s). It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector (installed), depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, no start condition, metallic debris in the fuel system. The CP4 pump has a reputation for self-destructing and sending metal shavings through the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CP4 pump and thoroughly cleaning the entire fuel system, including the fuel lines, injectors, and fuel tank. CP3 conversions (installing the older, more reliable CP3 pump) are also a popular option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $10,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and the solution chosen (CP4 replacement vs. CP3 conversion).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Allison Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibration felt during light acceleration, often at lower speeds. This is typically caused by the torque converter clutch failing to lock up properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or flushing the transmission fluid with a fluid designed to stop torque converter shudder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on if a new torque converter is installed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Flare**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A delay or surge in RPMs during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Can often be fixed by replacing the TCM. However, replacement of the entire transmission may be required if the problem persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $5,000+ depending on the shop and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a rougher ride. The leaf springs can weaken over time, especially with heavy use.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty leaf springs is also a common option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a few days of being fully charged. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve diagnosing each electrical circuit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights on the dashboard, such as the ABS light, TPMS light, or check engine light. This can be caused by faulty sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor (depending on the type of sensor and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and other areas of the body.
    *   Solution: Repairing the rusted areas. This may involve sanding, patching, and repainting the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ per panel (depending on the severity of the rust and the quality of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or installing a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the solution chosen).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, rebooting, or malfunctioning of the radio or infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Updating the software, replacing the head unit, or repairing the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity of the issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The most severe problems are related to the engines, particularly the Duramax diesel's fuel system. These repairs can be very expensive. While the gasoline engine has relatively less severe problems on average, it is still prone to expensive repairs. Suspension and electrical issues are also common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. When purchasing a used 2015 Silverado 2500HD, it is important to have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a mechanic to identify any potential problems.
