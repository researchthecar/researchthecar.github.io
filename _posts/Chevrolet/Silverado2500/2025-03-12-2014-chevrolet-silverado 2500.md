Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 2500, categorized and formatted as requested. The 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a popular heavy-duty truck known for its towing capability and workhorse reputation. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (gasoline) producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.6L Duramax V8 turbo-diesel, rated at 397 horsepower and 765 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were primarily paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the truck's ruggedness and towing capacity, but common complaints include concerns about fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), the infotainment system, and certain reported mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (Gasoline)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and potential engine damage. This is often due to the AFM lifters collapsing. Check engine light will illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace all lifters (including non-AFM lifters), the lifter guide, and the head gasket and potentially the camshaft. Deleting the AFM system is an option during the repair by replacing the cam and lifters with non-AFM parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, sometimes exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. This can lead to fouled spark plugs and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Some suggest installing a catch can to mitigate oil consumption, while others recommend replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. A compression test can help diagnose the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (catch can install) - $4,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax V8 (Diesel)**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls, lack of power, difficulty starting. The CP4 high-pressure fuel pump is known to be prone to failure, especially when contaminated fuel is used. When the pump fails, it sends metal shavings into the fuel system and can cause damage to injectors, fuel rails, and other components.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 pump. Some owners opt to upgrade to a more robust CP3 pump as a preventative measure. Replacing the entire fuel system is often necessary if the CP4 pump catastrophically fails and contaminates the system with metal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $10,000+ (depending on the extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke upon startup. Glow plugs are essential for cold-weather starting in diesel engines.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plug(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on how many plugs are replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, slipping during acceleration, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Consider replacing the transmission fluid and filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or erratic shift patterns. The valve body controls the flow of transmission fluid and can malfunction due to wear or contamination.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Clunking/Popping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noise heard when going over bumps or turning. Often caused by worn ball joints, tie rod ends, or stabilizer bar links.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on the parts needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sagging, especially when carrying a load. Reduced ride quality and load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs, or add helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, or lights. The BCM controls various electrical functions in the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the BCM and replace or reprogram as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Screen freezes, unresponsive buttons, Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Update the infotainment system software or replace the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $1,000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on rocker panels/cab corners**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming in the rocker panels and the bottom rear corners of the cab.
    *   Solution: Cut out the old rust and weld in new metal
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Filler Neck Corrosion**

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a capable truck, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the AFM system in the 6.0L gas engine and the CP4 fuel pump in the 6.6L Duramax, can be costly. Transmission issues and suspension wear are also common concerns. Electrical problems, such as BCM malfunctions, can be frustrating. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but being informed allows potential buyers to inspect vehicles carefully and budget for potential repairs.
