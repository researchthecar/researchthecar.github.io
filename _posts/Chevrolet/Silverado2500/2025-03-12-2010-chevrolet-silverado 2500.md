The 2010 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its capability and durability. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (365 hp, 660 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were the 6-speed 6L90 automatic for the gasoline engine and the Allison 1000 6-speed automatic for the diesel. Owners generally appreciate the truck's towing capacity and ruggedness, but common complaints often include concerns about fuel economy, certain electrical glitches, and potential diesel engine issues.
