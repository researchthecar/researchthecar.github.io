The 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing capacity and ruggedness. It's a popular choice for those who need a workhorse. Available engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (353 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8, and the highly regarded 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (360 hp, 650 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options are primarily the Allison 1000 6-speed automatic for the diesel and a 4L80E or 6L90E automatic for the gasoline engines. Owners often praise its dependability and towing capabilities, while common dislikes include its fuel economy and some reported reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD, while a capable truck, can experience a range of issues. The Duramax diesel is generally robust but can suffer from fuel injector and turbo issues which can be expensive. The 6.0L gas engine has known oil consumption issues. Both automatic transmissions can present problems with slipping. Suspension wear is a common issue due to the heavy-duty nature of the truck. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster failures and 4WD actuator problems, are also potential headaches. Rust on rocker panels and cab corners is another factor to consider, especially in areas with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should have a thorough inspection performed, paying particular attention to the engine, transmission, and undercarriage, to avoid costly repairs down the line.
