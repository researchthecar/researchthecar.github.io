**Introduction:**

The 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 2500, a heavy-duty pickup truck, is powered by a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 6.0L V8 with a 6-speed automatic transmission rated at 367 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque. It offers a spacious cabin, robust towing and hauling capabilities, and a durable design. However, several prevalent issues have been reported by owners.

**Engine**

* **6.0L V8**
    * **Valve Cover Gasket Failure:** Leaking oil from the valve covers due to worn-out gaskets. Replacement gaskets and labor cost around $300 - $500+.
    * **Manifold Bolt Failure:** Broken intake manifold bolts leading to coolant leaks, engine overheating, and loss of power. Repair involves replacing the bolts and damaged components, costing $500 - $1000+.
    * **AFM Lifter Failure:** Collapsed lifters in the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system causing engine noise, reduced power, and potential catastrophic engine failure. Replacement lifters and labor can cost $2000 - $4000+.
    * **Water Pump Failure:** Leaking or failing water pump resulting in overheating and loss of coolant. Replacement of the water pump costs $300 - $600+.
    * **Ignition Coil Failure:** Malfunctioning ignition coils cause misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine performance. Replacing the coil packs costs $200 - $400+.
* **Duramax 6.6L Turbo Diesel**
    * **Injector Failure:** Leaking or faulty fuel injectors leading to poor fuel economy, engine noise, and reduced power. Replacing the injectors costs $1000 - $2000 per injector.
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** Worn-out turbocharger causing reduced boost pressure, power loss, and excessive exhaust smoke. Turbocharger replacement costs $1500 - $3000+.
    * **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Failure:** Sticking or malfunctioning EGR valve resulting in reduced engine performance, increased emissions, and potential engine damage. Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve costs $300 - $600+.
    * **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure:** Malfunctioning crankshaft position sensor causing starting issues, engine stalling, and reduced power. Sensor replacement costs $200 - $400+.
    * **Fuel Pressure Regulator Failure:** Faulty fuel pressure regulator leading to unstable fuel pressure, poor engine performance, and potential fuel leaks. Replacing the regulator costs $200 - $400+.

**Transmission**

* **6-Speed Automatic (6L90E):**
    * **Slippage and Shuddering:** Transmission slippage or shuddering during gear changes indicating worn-out clutches or torque converter issues. Transmission rebuild or replacement costs $2000 - $4000+.
    * **Solenoid Failure:** Malfunctioning solenoids affecting shift quality, causing harsh or delayed shifts. Solenoid replacement costs $300 - $600+.
    * **Torque Converter Failure:** Worn-out torque converter causing slippage, overheating, and loss of power. Torque converter replacement costs $1000 - $2000+.
* **Allison 1000 5-Speed (Duramax Option):**
    * **Pump Failure:** Faulty transmission pump leading to low fluid pressure, overheating, and potential transmission failure. Pump replacement costs $1200 - $2000+.
    * **Solenoid Pack Failure:** Malfunctioning solenoid pack causing shifting issues, delayed engagements, or no engagement. Solenoid pack replacement costs $500 - $1000+.
    * **Transfer Case Leak:** Leaking transfer case due to worn-out seals or gaskets. Transfer case repair or replacement costs $500 - $1500+.
