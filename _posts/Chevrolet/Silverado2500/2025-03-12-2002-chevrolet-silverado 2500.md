The 2002 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its workhorse capabilities and durability. Popular for towing and hauling, the Silverado 2500 also offered a comfortable ride for its time. However, it wasn't without its issues. Available engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (producing around 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8, and the legendary 6.6L Duramax diesel V8. Transmission options were typically the 4L80E four-speed automatic for the gasoline engines and a five-speed or six-speed Allison automatic for the Duramax. Owners often praised the truck's powerful engines, towing capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design. Common complaints revolve around rust, electrical gremlins, and some component failures related to age and heavy use.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet Silverado 2500, while a capable truck, suffers from issues common to vehicles of its age, especially those used for heavy-duty applications. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Electrical problems, especially related to the instrument cluster and BCM, are also frequently reported. Engine issues vary by engine type, with the Duramax suffering from injector issues and the 8.1L with oil consumption issues. Transmission problems, such as slipping and harsh shifting, can be costly to repair. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to address, others, such as engine rebuilds or transmission replacements, can represent a significant financial burden. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the truck for rust, electrical issues, and engine/transmission problems before purchasing.
