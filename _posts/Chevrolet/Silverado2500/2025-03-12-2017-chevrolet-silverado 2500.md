The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (445 hp, 910 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options include the 6L90 6-speed automatic for the 6.0L V8 and the Allison 1000 6-speed automatic for the 6.6L Duramax. Owners often praise the Silverado 2500HD for its powerful engine options, comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck), and strong work ethic. Common complaints include concerns over fuel economy (especially with the Duramax), some build quality issues, and the relatively basic interior design compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often noticed between oil changes. May be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported success with replacing the valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+

**6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (L5P)**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust. Can also cause fuel to enter the engine oil, leading to accelerated engine wear. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel injector performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors. High pressure fuel pump replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, reduced engine performance, and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to DPF clogging or efficiency. Can be caused by excessive idling, short trips, or faulty sensors.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration, DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement. Addressing underlying issues causing excessive soot production (e.g., faulty sensors, EGR system issues).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD, while a capable truck, does have some common issues. Engine problems, especially with the 6.6L Duramax (fuel injector and DPF issues), can be costly. Transmission issues like torque converter shudder in the Allison 1000 are also a concern. Suspension and electrical problems are fairly typical for a truck of this type and age. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of repairs when considering a purchase. Thorough inspection and maintenance records are essential.
