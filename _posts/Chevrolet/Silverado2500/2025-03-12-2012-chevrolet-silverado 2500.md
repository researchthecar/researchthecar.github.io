The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a popular heavy-duty truck known for its workhorse capabilities and towing prowess. Owners generally appreciate its ruggedness, strong engine options, and comfortable ride for a heavy-duty vehicle. However, it's not without its flaws. Common complaints include some electrical gremlins, occasional emissions issues, and the typical maintenance associated with a truck designed for heavy use. Engine choices for the 2012 Silverado 2500HD include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (397 hp, 765 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often noticeable as the truck ages and mileage increases. May manifest as needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a potential decrease in engine performance.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include replacing valve seals or piston rings. In more severe cases, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and chosen repair
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **AFM (Active Fuel Management) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, rough running, misfires, and potential damage to the camshaft. This issue is more prevalent in later model years where AFM became more widespread.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and possibly the camshaft. AFM delete kits are also a common solution to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (LML)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine knocking. Can also cause fuel in the oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time for consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ depending on how many injectors.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, and a metallic grinding noise from the engine bay. The CP4 pump is known to be more sensitive to fuel contamination compared to the older CP3 pumps. When the pump fails, it sends metallic debris throughout the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 fuel pump, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and fuel filter. Some owners opt to convert to the older CP3 fuel pump for increased reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential overheating. The EGR cooler is prone to cracking and leaking coolant.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine derate, check engine light, and diagnostic trouble codes related to the DEF system.
    * Solution: Replacing the DEF injector and/or DEF tank.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, particularly under load, slipping between gears, and potential complete failure of the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary if debris from the failed torque converter has contaminated the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, or failure to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, clunking noises from the front end, and uneven tire wear. Ball joints, tie rod ends, and pitman/idler arms are common wear items.
    *   Solution: Replace worn front-end components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning (stuck, inaccurate, or not working), dim or flickering backlighting, and potential complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as lights not working, power windows malfunctioning, or issues with the security system.
    * Solution: Replacing the BCM
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, particularly around the rocker panels, cab corners, and wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Rust repair and prevention. This may involve sanding, patching, and repainting affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in hot climates. This is often due to sun exposure and temperature fluctuations.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or install a dashboard cover.

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD, while a capable truck, can suffer from a range of issues, some potentially costly. The Duramax diesel engine, while powerful, is known for fuel system vulnerabilities, and the 6.0L Vortec can experience oil consumption. Electrical issues are also common. The severity of these issues varies, but some (like CP4 pump failure or a complete engine rebuild) can lead to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the truck's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
