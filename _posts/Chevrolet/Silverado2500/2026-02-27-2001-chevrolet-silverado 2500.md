### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 is a capable truck, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. The gasoline V8 engines can experience intake manifold gasket leaks, while the diesel 6.6L Duramax is known for injector line issues. Transmissions, particularly the 4L80-E, may require attention to the torque converter. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and standard alternator failures are also noted. Rust is a significant concern for exterior body panels. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and timely repairs, the Silverado 2500 can remain a reliable workhorse.
