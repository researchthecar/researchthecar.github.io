The 2017 Chevrolet SS is a high-performance, rear-wheel-drive sedan that packs a serious punch. It's powered by a 6.2L LS3 V8 engine that produces 415 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque. The engine came paired with either a Tremec TR6060 6-speed manual transmission or a 6L80 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners love the car's powerful engine, comfortable interior, and sleeper status. However, some dislike its relatively plain styling and limited availability, as it was only produced for a short time.
