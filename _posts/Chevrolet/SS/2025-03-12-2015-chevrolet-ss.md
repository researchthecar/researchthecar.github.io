**Summary:**

The 2015 Chevrolet SS has relatively few widespread issues for a performance sedan. The most significant concerns revolve around potential engine problems such as lifter failure and oil consumption, and the MRC suspension. The automatic transmission can also present issues, though usually with high mileage. Clear coat failure is a cosmetic issue that, while not affecting reliability, can detract from the vehicle's appearance. Overall, a well-maintained 2015 Chevrolet SS can be a reliable and enjoyable car, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and budget accordingly. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
