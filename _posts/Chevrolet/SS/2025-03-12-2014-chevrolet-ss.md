The 2014 Chevrolet SS is a performance sedan that packs a serious punch with its 6.2L LS3 V8 engine, delivering 415 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque. The 2014 model year offered two transmission options: a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. The SS is lauded for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and impressive power. However, some owners have noted a few common issues, including concerns about the AFM (Active Fuel Management) system, potential for oil consumption, and some electrical gremlins. While it's praised for being a "sleeper" performance car with comfortable daily driving and a manual transmission option, some dislike the relatively plain exterior styling and limited availability of certain parts.

**Engine**

**6.2L LS3 V8**

*   **AFM Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifters on the deactivated cylinders can fail, leading to misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. This is sometimes accompanied by a ticking or knocking noise.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters is the common solution. Some owners opt to delete the AFM system altogether, installing a non-AFM camshaft and lifters to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of damage and whether AFM is deleted.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, especially during high-performance driving. This can be due to the piston rings not sealing properly or issues with the PCV system.
    *   Solution: A compression test can help determine if piston rings are the cause. Replacing the rings or addressing PCV system issues can reduce consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh shifting, particularly between gears, or slipping in the transmission. This can be due to valve body issues, worn clutches, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes alleviate minor issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**
*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Chevrolet SS utilizes Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) shocks for adaptive damping. These shocks can fail over time, resulting in a loss of damping and a bouncy ride. Leaking fluid from the shocks is a common indicator of failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed MRC shocks is the only viable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ for parts and labor, depending on the number of shocks needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reset or software update.
    *   Solution: Attempting a system reset by disconnecting the battery for a short period or updating the software can resolve the issue. In some cases, the HMI module may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1,000+ for HMI module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattling/Wind Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rattling or excessive wind noise coming from the sunroof area, especially at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the sunroof or replacing worn seals can help reduce noise and rattling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the necessary repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2014 Chevrolet SS, while a powerful and enjoyable performance sedan, does have some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the AFM system and potential for lifter failure, which can lead to costly engine repairs. Oil consumption and transmission issues also warrant attention. While the electrical and interior issues are generally less severe, they can still be frustrating. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the vehicle's condition.
