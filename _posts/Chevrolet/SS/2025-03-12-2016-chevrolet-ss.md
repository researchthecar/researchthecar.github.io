The 2016 Chevrolet SS is a rear-wheel-drive, high-performance sedan that was only offered with a potent 6.2L LS3 V8 engine producing 415 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a Tremec TR6060 6-speed manual or a 6L80 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the car for its sleeper status, powerful engine, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common complaints revolve around the fuel economy, lack of modern technology compared to newer vehicles, and rarity which can make parts slightly harder to find.

**Engine**

**6.2L LS3 V8**

*   **Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the top of the engine, loss of power, misfires. This is typically caused by the lifters failing internally, specifically the needle bearings within the roller lifter.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters. It is often recommended to replace all lifters on the affected bank of cylinders, along with the head gaskets and possibly the camshaft if it has been damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption. This can be due to several factors, including piston ring design, PCV system issues, or valve stem seal wear. Symptoms include needing to add oil between changes and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause. Solutions range from replacing the PCV valve, using a different oil viscosity, or replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve) - $5,000+ (Piston Rings)

    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during light acceleration. Some owners also report a shuddering sensation, especially at highway speeds, often associated with the torque converter. This can be caused by valve body issues or fluid degradation.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or rebuild may be necessary. In some cases, the torque converter itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (Fluid Flush) - $3,000+ (Torque Converter/Valve Body)

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet SS is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of potential issues. The most significant concerns relate to the engine, particularly lifter failures and oil consumption. The MRC suspension can also be costly to repair. While some electrical and interior issues exist, they are generally less severe and less frequent. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue, with engine repairs potentially reaching several thousand dollars. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
