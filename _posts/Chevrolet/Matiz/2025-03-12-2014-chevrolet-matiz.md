The 2014 Chevrolet Matiz (also known as the Spark in many markets) is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city driving. The 2014 model year typically came with a 1.2-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 84 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque. It was generally available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Matiz's affordability and ease of parking in tight spaces, but some dislike its limited cargo space and relatively basic interior features.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car won't start, requiring a jump start; frequent battery replacement. The cause can range from a parasitic drain (something is drawing power when the car is off) to a failing alternator.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the parasitic drain (which could be a faulty door switch, aftermarket accessory, or other component). If the alternator is faulty, replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Summary:**

The 2014 Chevrolet Matiz/Spark presents a mix of minor and moderate issues. Engine problems like misfires and catalytic converter failure can be costly, while transmission issues such as harsh shifting, particularly with the automatic transmission, could signal more significant repairs down the line. Suspension issues are relatively common and inexpensive to fix. Electrical gremlins such as battery drain can be a persistent nuisance. Overall, while the Matiz/Spark is an affordable and economical car, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and budget for potential repairs.
