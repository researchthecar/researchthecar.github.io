The 2015 Chevrolet Matiz (sold as the Spark in many markets, including the United States) is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. The primary engine option for this model year is a 1.2-liter inline-4 producing around 84 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its maneuverability in urban environments and its low running costs. Conversely, criticisms typically focus on its limited cargo space, underpowered engine, and basic interior features.
