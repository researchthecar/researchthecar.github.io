The 2013 Chevrolet Matiz, also known as the Spark in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city driving. In many markets, the 2013 Matiz came with a 1.0-liter inline-4 engine that produced around 68 horsepower and 69 lb-ft of torque.
