The 2011 Chevrolet Matiz, also known as the Chevrolet Spark in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback designed for city driving and fuel efficiency. In most markets, the primary engine option available was a 1.0L S-TEC II inline-four engine, producing approximately 68 horsepower and 69 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. A 4-speed automatic transmission was also available in some regions. Owners generally appreciate the Matiz for its compact size, ease of parking, and fuel economy. However, common dislikes include its limited power, basic interior, and small cargo space.

Engine and transmission problems, such as catalytic converter failure, oxygen sensor issues, and shifting problems, can be moderately expensive to address. Suspension issues, like worn bushings and failed struts, affect ride quality and handling. Electrical problems, such as battery drain and faulty window switches, are also noted. Interior issues, such as air conditioning and cracked dashboards, detract from the ownership experience. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of repairs when considering a used 2011 Chevrolet Matiz.
