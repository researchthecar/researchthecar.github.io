**Engine**

**1.2L Four-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, reduced fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating. This can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or a vacuum leak.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty spark plugs and/or ignition coils. Address any vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the number of cylinders affected and the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. Reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Hesitation/Shuddering During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may hesitate or shudder during acceleration, particularly from a stop or at low speeds. This can be due to wear and tear on the CVT belt, valve body issues, or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid flush and replace the filter. If the issue persists, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid flush $150 - $300; CVT rebuild or replacement $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and bottoming out over bumps. This is attributed to the vehicle's light weight and the relatively soft suspension components.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent dead batteries, especially after short periods of inactivity. This can be due to a parasitic draw on the battery caused by a faulty electrical component or module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows not working or operating intermittently. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Often the check engine light can come on due to a loose gas cap. Additionally, the light can come on due to a multitude of issues.
    *   Solution: Check and tighten the gas cap. Get an OBD scan to determine what is causing the check engine light to come on.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Free if it's the gas cap. $100 - $500+ depending on the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Latch Failure**

**Summary**

The 2013 Chevrolet Spark, while a fuel-efficient and affordable option, does have several potential issues to be aware of. Engine issues like misfires and catalytic converter failure can lead to moderate repair costs. The CVT transmission, if equipped, may experience hesitation or shuddering, potentially requiring expensive repairs or replacement. Suspension components can wear prematurely, and electrical problems such as battery drain and power window failure are common. While these issues may not be catastrophic, potential buyers should be aware of the possible costs associated with these repairs.
