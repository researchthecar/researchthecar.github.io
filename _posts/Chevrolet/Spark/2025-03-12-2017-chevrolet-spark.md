The 2017 Chevrolet Spark is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It's powered by a 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine producing 98 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission is standard, with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) available as an option. Owners often appreciate its easy maneuverability, especially in urban environments, and its user-friendly infotainment system. However, some common complaints include its small size which can make it feel cramped for taller individuals or those carrying passengers. Other common complaints include limited cargo space and lack of power, especially at highway speeds.
