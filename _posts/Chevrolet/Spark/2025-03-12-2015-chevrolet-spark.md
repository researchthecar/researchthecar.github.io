The 2015 Chevrolet Spark is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city driving and first-time car buyers. The Spark is equipped with a 1.2L Inline-4 cylinder engine that produces 84 horsepower and 83 lb-ft of torque, and is available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its compact size for easy parking and its relatively spacious interior for its class. Common dislikes include the engine's limited power, especially on highways or inclines, and some concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Check the oil level regularly and top off as needed. In some cases, a PCV valve replacement might help. More severe cases might require engine work, such as piston ring replacement or a full engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 (PCV Valve), $50 - $150 (Labor PCV Valve), $500 - $3000+ (Engine work/Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause rough idling, loss of power, and the check engine light to illuminate. Possible causes include faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the misfire using an OBD-II scanner. Replace the faulty component, such as the ignition coil, spark plug, or fuel injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200 per coil or injector (parts), $50-$150 per spark plug (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Shuddering or Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a shuddering or jerking sensation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be caused by degraded transmission fluid or issues with the CVT's internal components.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid change using the correct fluid specified by Chevrolet. If the problem persists, further diagnosis of the CVT internal components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (CVT fluid change), $1000+ (CVT repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delay when shifting from Park or Neutral to Drive.
    *   Solution: Transmission Replacement or fluid change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (CVT fluid change), $1000+ (CVT repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio or infotainment system may freeze, fail to power on, or experience connectivity issues with Bluetooth or USB devices.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the system by disconnecting the battery for a few minutes. Check for any software updates. If the problem persists, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (Diagnostic), $200 - $800+ (Replacement Radio/Infotainment System)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or frequent jump starts. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or an aging battery.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. If the battery is healthy, perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (Battery Replacement), $100 - $300 (Parasitic Draw Diagnosis and Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exterior door handles, especially on the driver's side, can become loose or break.

**Summary:**

The 2015 Chevrolet Spark, while affordable and fuel-efficient, does have some common issues owners should be aware of. The most concerning issues relate to the CVT transmission and potential engine problems such as excessive oil consumption. The electrical and exterior issues are generally less severe and less costly to address. Overall, potential buyers should inspect the vehicle carefully, paying particular attention to the transmission's performance and engine oil levels, and factor in potential repair costs.
