**The 2020 Chevrolet Spark is a subcompact hatchback that offers a blend of affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability.** It is powered by a 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 98 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a five-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Spark is praised for its low starting price, fuel-efficient performance, and easy handling in urban settings.
