The 2020 Chevrolet Spark is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and easy maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city driving and first-time car buyers. It is only available with one engine option, a 1.4L Ecotec Inline-4 producing 98 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Drivers often praise the Spark's nimble handling and user-friendly infotainment system. Conversely, some criticisms include its limited rear passenger space and less-than-stellar acceleration.

**Engine**

**1.4L Ecotec Inline-4 (LV7)**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes indicating catalytic converter inefficiency. Potential sulfur smell, reduced fuel economy, and/or failed emissions test.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, poor fuel economy, rough idling, hesitation during acceleration. Diagnostic codes pointing to a faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected oxygen sensor (upstream or downstream).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Shudder/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shaking or shuddering during acceleration, particularly at low speeds. Hesitation or delayed response when pressing the accelerator. Some owners report a feeling of "slipping."
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change may alleviate the issue if caught early. More severe cases may require a valve body replacement or, in extreme circumstances, a complete CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid Change: $150-$300, Valve Body: $800 - $1500, Replacement: $3000 - $5000+

**Summary**

The 2020 Chevrolet Spark, while an affordable and practical choice, does have some reported issues. The most concerning relate to the CVT transmission, which can suffer from shuddering, hesitation, and even premature failure, with repairs potentially costing several thousand dollars. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and catalytic converter problems can also be costly to address. While not all Sparks will experience these issues, it's essential for potential buyers to be aware of them and thoroughly inspect the vehicle, especially if it has the CVT transmission.
