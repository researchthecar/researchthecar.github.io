### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Chevrolet Spark generally offers decent reliability for its segment, with the most commonly cited issues revolving around the powertrain, particularly the CVT transmission and potential oil/coolant leaks from the 1.4L engine. Electrical components like the battery and infotainment system can also present minor concerns. However, many of these issues are not unique to the Spark and are relatively common across small vehicles. The manual transmission variant appears to be more robust. Owners should be mindful of regular maintenance, especially for the CVT, to mitigate potential problems and ensure longevity. Overall, for its price point, the Spark is a reasonable choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability points.
