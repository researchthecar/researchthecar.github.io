The 2016 Chevrolet Spark is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and nimble handling, making it a popular choice for city driving. The sole engine option is a 1.4L Ecotec inline-4, producing 98 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Drivers appreciate its easy parking, user-friendly infotainment system, and surprisingly spacious interior for its size. However, common complaints include a lack of power, especially at highway speeds, a somewhat noisy engine, and limited cargo space.
