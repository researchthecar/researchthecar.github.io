**Introduction:**

The 2014 Chevrolet Spark is a subcompact hatchback that offers a fuel-efficient and affordable option for city driving. It comes equipped with a 1.2-liter 4-cylinder engine, mated to either a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Known for its maneuverability and low operating costs, the Spark has earned praise for its peppy performance and spacious interior for its size. However, it has also received some criticism for its lack of power at highway speeds and its somewhat cramped rear seats.
