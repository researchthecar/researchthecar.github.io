The 2022 Chevrolet Spark is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and nimble handling, making it a popular choice for city dwellers and first-time car buyers. It comes with a 1.4-liter Ecotec inline-four engine, producing 98 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Spark's ease of parking, fuel efficiency, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some common criticisms include its limited rear seat space, modest acceleration, and basic interior materials.

**Engine**

**1.4L Ecotec Inline-Four**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil regularly, low oil level warnings, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels, use of recommended oil viscosity, and checking for leaks. In severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine overhaul may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature catalytic converter failure, resulting in a check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency. Symptoms include poor fuel economy and potential emissions test failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly from a stop or at low speeds. This can be caused by issues within the CVT's belt and pulley system.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can improve transmission performance. However, more significant issues may require valve body replacement or even a complete CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (software update), $800 - $1500 (valve body replacement), $3000 - $5000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of the front struts or shocks, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. Symptoms include excessive body roll and decreased handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced occasional glitches with the infotainment system, including freezing, slow response times, or Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or updating the software. In more severe cases, replacement of the infotainment system may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $100 - $300 (software update) - $500 - $1500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the battery draining prematurely, especially if the car is left unused for a few days. This can be caused by parasitic drain from electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the source of the parasitic drain, which may involve identifying faulty modules or wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rattling and buzzing noises emanating from various interior components, such as the dashboard, door panels, and rear hatch area.
    *   Solution: Locating and securing the source of the noise, which may involve adding foam padding or tightening loose fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on complexity and if a shop is doing the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Chevrolet Spark, while praised for its affordability and fuel efficiency, has some reported issues. Engine-related issues such as excessive oil consumption and catalytic converter failure can lead to significant repair costs. The CVT transmission can also exhibit problems with hesitation and jerking, potentially leading to expensive repairs or replacement. Electrical glitches, suspension wear, and interior noises are other common complaints. Overall, while the Spark is a budget-friendly option, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing. The severity and cost of the issues range from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars, depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
