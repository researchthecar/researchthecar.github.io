**Introduction:**

The 1990 Chevrolet Beretta is a compact coupe and convertible offered with a choice of two engine and transmission options:

* **2.0L SOHC MPFI 4-cylinder:** 98 hp, 123 lb-ft of torque
* **2.8L V6 with MPFI:** 130 hp, 160 lb-ft of torque

The 2.0L engine was paired with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.8L V6 came exclusively with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Beretta is appreciated for its sporty handling and good looks, but it is criticized for its cramped interior and limited rear visibility.
