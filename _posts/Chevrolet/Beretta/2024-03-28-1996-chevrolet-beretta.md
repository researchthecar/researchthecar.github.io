**Vehicle Introduction:**

The 1996 Chevrolet Beretta was a mid-sized coupe that offered a choice of two engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.2L inline-4 with 120 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 3.1L V6 with 160 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Beretta was praised for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and responsive handling. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power and poor fuel economy.
