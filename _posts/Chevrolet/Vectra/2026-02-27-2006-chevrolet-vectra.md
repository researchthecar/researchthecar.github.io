### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet Vectra presents a mixed reliability profile. While many components are robust, specific issues are noted across its engine and transmission options, particularly with the manual M32 gearbox's bearing wear and diesel engines' DPF systems. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM can also be a concern. Suspension components like wishbone bushings are common wear items. Exterior rust, especially on older models in corrosive climates, and interior issues like AC compressor failure are also reported. Careful inspection and maintenance, especially for the noted problem areas, are recommended for owners of this model.
