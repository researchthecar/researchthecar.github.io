The 2006 Chevrolet Vectra, sold primarily in Europe and Australia (where it was rebadged as a Holden Vectra), was a mid-size family car offering a blend of comfort and practicality. Engine choices included a range of petrol and diesel options. A popular choice was the 1.8L petrol engine, which produced around 120 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciated the Vectra's spacious interior and comfortable ride, while common complaints often revolved around electrical issues and the reliability of certain engine components. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed automatic transmission.
