**Introduction**

The 2007 Chevrolet Vectra is a compact sedan that offers a blend of style, performance, and value. It features a spacious cabin, a well-equipped interior, and a responsive handling. The Vectra is available with a choice of two engines: a 2.0-liter inline-four or a 2.2-liter inline-four. Both engines come paired with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.

While the Vectra has received praise for its affordability, comfort, and handling, it has also been criticized for its mediocre performance and subpar fuel economy.
