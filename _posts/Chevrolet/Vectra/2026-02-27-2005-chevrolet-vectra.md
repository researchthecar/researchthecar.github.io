### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Vectra presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around specific engine variants, particularly the diesel engines with DPF and DMF concerns, and some petrol engines experiencing ignition coil or oil leak problems. Manual transmissions, especially the M32 variants, are known for bearing wear. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, can cause frustrating intermittent faults. Exterior rust can be a concern on older models, and interior climate control and dashboard display issues are not uncommon. Despite these points, many owners find the Vectra to be a capable and comfortable car when well-maintained, with many issues being repairable at moderate costs. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
