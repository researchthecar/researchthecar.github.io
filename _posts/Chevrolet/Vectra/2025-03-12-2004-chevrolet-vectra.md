The 2004 Chevrolet Vectra, also known as the Opel Vectra C in many markets, was a mid-size car offering various engine and transmission choices. Common engine options included a range of petrol engines like the 1.8L, 2.0L, 2.2L, and 3.2L V6, as well as diesel options like the 2.0L and 2.2L CDTI engines. Transmissions included 5-speed and 6-speed manual gearboxes and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Vectra for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and relatively affordable price point. However, common dislikes often include issues with electrical components, build quality concerns, and in some cases, engine reliability.

**Summary**

The 2004 Chevrolet Vectra/Opel Vectra C, while appreciated for its practicality and affordability, does exhibit several common issues. Engine problems, particularly timing chain and EGR valve issues, can be costly. Electrical problems, especially CIM module failure, are also prevalent and can be a significant inconvenience. Suspension bushing wear and rust are common age-related issues that should be inspected. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing a used 2004 Vectra. The severity of the issues varies, but some, like engine timing chain failure, can result in significant repair bills.
