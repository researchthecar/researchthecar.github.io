### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Vectra presents a mixed reliability profile. While its V6 engines and some manual transmissions are generally robust, the smaller Ecotec engines, particularly the 2.0L Turbo and 2.2L variants, can experience specific issues like turbocharger problems and oil consumption. Automatic transmissions may require attention to solenoids. Suspension components like control arm bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM, and exterior rust are also points to consider. Overall, regular maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble are key to maintaining reliability for this model.
