### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Vectra presents a mixed reliability profile. Diesel variants, particularly those with the 1.9L engine, are prone to DPF and EGR issues, common in many modern diesels. Petrol engines, especially the turbocharged variants, can experience turbocharger problems and oil leaks. Manual transmissions, notably the M32, are known for bearing wear, while automatics can suffer from solenoid failures. Suspension components like control arm bushes and shock absorbers are typical wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and alternator failures are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern on older models, and interior issues like A/C leaks and central locking actuator failures are not uncommon. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for managing these potential issues.
