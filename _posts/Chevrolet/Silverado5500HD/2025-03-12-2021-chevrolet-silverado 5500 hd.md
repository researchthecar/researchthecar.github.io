Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 5500 HD, broken down by category and configuration.

The 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 5500 HD is a robust chassis cab truck designed for heavy-duty commercial applications. It is favored for its strong towing and payload capabilities, its relatively comfortable (for its class) cabin, and the availability of upfitter switches. Common complaints center around the ride quality (as expected for a heavy-duty truck), and some reliability concerns which will be listed below. The Silverado 5500 HD comes standard with a Duramax 6.6-liter Turbo-Diesel V8 engine producing 350 horsepower and 700 lb-ft of torque paired with an Allison 6-speed automatic transmission. This is the only engine and transmission option available for this vehicle.

**Engine**

**Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8 (L5D)**

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, black smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine damage. Can be difficult to diagnose and often requires specialized equipment.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors. Often, all injectors are replaced at the same time to ensure consistent performance and prevent future failures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+ per injector, so potentially $5,000 - $10,000+ for all.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, warning lights on the dashboard, reduced engine power, and potential engine damage if not addressed. Can be caused by excessive idling, short trips, or faulty sensors.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration by a dealership, replacement of the DPF if severely clogged, or repair/replacement of faulty sensors causing the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Forced regeneration $200 - $500. DPF replacement $1,500 - $3,000+. Sensor replacement $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, rough idling, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty glow plugs. It's often recommended to replace all glow plugs at the same time for consistent performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuttering or vibration during acceleration, especially at lower speeds.  Slipping between gears.  Abnormal transmission noises.  Check engine light may illuminate.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.  Inspection of the transmission for any damage caused by the failing torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+ depending on the extent of damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Shift Solenoid Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, transmission slipping, check engine light.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty shift solenoids. Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may also be recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the number of solenoids needing replacement and the complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting, frequent jump starts. May be caused by aftermarket accessories, faulty modules not shutting down properly, or a defective battery.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the source of the parasitic drain. Repair or replacement of the faulty component. Testing and replacement of the battery if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for testing) - $500+ depending on the cause.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine performance, inaccurate readings on the dashboard, and potential safety issues depending on the affected sensor. Common sensors to fail include NOx sensors, exhaust temperature sensors, and DEF quality sensors.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the specific sensor failure. Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor depending on the type and location.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Corrosion on Undercarriage/Frame**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts. More prevalent in areas with heavy salt use during winter.
    * Solution: Undercoating treatment to prevent further corrosion. Removal of existing rust and application of rust inhibitor. Repair or replacement of severely corroded components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Fan Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced airflow from the vents, noisy fan operation, or complete failure of the fan.
    * Solution: Replacement of the HVAC fan motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 5500 HD, while a capable work truck, can experience some reliability issues. Engine problems, particularly related to the fuel system and emissions controls, are a major concern due to the high cost of repair. Transmission issues with the Allison 6-speed, while less frequent, can also lead to expensive repairs. Electrical issues and corrosion are also noted concerns. While not all trucks will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision and maintenance planning. The severity of issues ranges from inconvenient (HVAC fan) to potentially catastrophic (engine failure). The cost to fix also varies greatly, with some repairs costing hundreds and others costing thousands of dollars.
