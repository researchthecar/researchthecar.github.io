The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 5500 HD is a robust and capable chassis cab truck designed for heavy-duty commercial applications. While specific, widespread issues for this model year are less documented compared to consumer vehicles, common themes emerge based on available data. Engine options include the 6.6L Duramax diesel V8 (401 hp and 464 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L L8T gasoline V8 (401 hp and 464 lb-ft of torque). The 6.6L Duramax is a popular choice for its reliability and power, while the 6.6L L8T is a cost effective option. Dislikes often revolve around the utilitarian interior and ride quality, but the truck is praised for its workhorse capabilities and customizable configurations. Both engines are paired to a 6-speed Allison transmission.
