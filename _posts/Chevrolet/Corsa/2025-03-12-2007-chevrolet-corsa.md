The 2007 Chevrolet Corsa, primarily sold in Latin American markets, is a subcompact car known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. Engine options typically included a 1.4L inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 90 horsepower and 95 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8L inline-4 engine producing around 105 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were generally a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic, depending on the market and engine configuration. Owners often appreciate the Corsa's compact size, making it easy to maneuver in urban environments, and its relatively low running costs. Common complaints include basic interior quality, limited rear passenger space, and modest performance, especially with the smaller engine option.

**Engine**

**1.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, bluish exhaust smoke, and the need to add oil more frequently than expected.
    *   Solution: The best solution is to inspect the piston rings and valve stem seals for wear. Replacing these components is often necessary to correct the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Oxygen Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine can be affected when the oxygen sensor fails. This could trigger the check engine light, decrease in fuel economy, and potential stalling issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Inline-4**

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, or difficulty starting. The IAC valve regulates the airflow to the engine during idle, and when it malfunctions, it can cause these symptoms.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, causing delayed acceleration or a feeling that the engine is revving without a corresponding increase in speed. This can indicate low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: Initially, check and top up the transmission fluid level, and consider a transmission fluid flush. If the problem persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
