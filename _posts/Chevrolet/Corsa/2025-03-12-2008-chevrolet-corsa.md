The 2008 Chevrolet Corsa is a subcompact car primarily sold in Latin America, not in North America, and is a different vehicle than the Chevrolet Cobalt or Aveo that were sold in the US at the time. It was available with a range of engines including a 1.4L gasoline engine. Information on specific engine stats like horsepower and torque is not readily available for all variants. Owners generally appreciate its fuel efficiency and affordability. Common dislikes include its relatively basic features and sometimes lackluster performance.

**Summary**

The 2008 Chevrolet Corsa, while a generally reliable and affordable vehicle, can experience issues related to oil consumption in the engine, suspension wear, and electrical problems. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some being relatively minor and inexpensive to fix (e.g., replacing bulbs), while others can be more significant (e.g., engine overhaul). Rust is also a potential concern, especially in areas with harsh weather conditions. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these common problems before purchasing.
