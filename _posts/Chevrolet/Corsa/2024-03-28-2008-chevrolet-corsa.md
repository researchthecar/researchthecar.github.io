**Introduction to the 2008 Chevrolet Corsa**

The 2008 Chevrolet Corsa was a compact hatchback offered with two engine options: a 1.4L Ecotec I4 and a 1.8L Ecotec I4. The 1.4L engine produced 100 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.8L engine produced 122 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

Known for its affordability, practicality, and hatchback versatility, the Corsa also received criticism for its lackluster performance and unrefined interior.
