**Introduction**

The 2002 Chevrolet Corsa is a subcompact hatchback available with a choice of gasoline engines and manual or automatic transmissions. The base model is powered by a 1.4-liter Ecotec engine that produces 90 horsepower and 90 lb-ft of torque. The optional 1.8-liter Ecotec engine generates 120 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Corsa has received praise for its sporty handling, comfortable interior, and fuel-efficient engines. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of power, cramped rear seat, and dated appearance.
