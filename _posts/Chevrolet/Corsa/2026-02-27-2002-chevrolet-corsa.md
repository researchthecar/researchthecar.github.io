### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet Corsa is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly its petrol engine variants, with the most common significant issues revolving around head gasket failures on smaller displacement engines and potential timing chain stretch on the 1.0L. Diesel models may encounter turbocharger or glow plug issues. Transmission reliability is decent for manual units, but the Easytronic automated manual can be a source of more complex and costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially with the instrument cluster and central locking, are not uncommon as the vehicle ages. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing specific known faults, the Corsa can remain a dependable small car.
