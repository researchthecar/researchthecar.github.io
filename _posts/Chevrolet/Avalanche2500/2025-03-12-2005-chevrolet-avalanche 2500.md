The 2005 Chevrolet Avalanche 2500 is a heavy-duty, full-size pickup truck with a unique midgate system that allows the rear seats and bed to be configured for different passenger and cargo needs. The Avalanche 2500 was only available with the 8.1L Vortec V8 engine and either the 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission. The 8.1L Vortec V8 produces 340 horsepower and 455 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the Avalanche 2500 for its versatility and towing capacity. However, some common complaints include poor fuel economy and the vehicle's large size, making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**8.1L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported increased oil consumption, especially at higher mileage. The engine may burn oil, leading to lower oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and top-offs. Switch to a higher viscosity oil. For severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil top-off) - $3,000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    * Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold bolts tend to break which causes the exhaust manifold to leak. This will cause the car to sound louder, lose fuel efficiency, and can damage other components if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold bolts as well as the exhaust manifold if it is warped.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600+

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension sagging, particularly under load, leading to poor ride quality and reduced load capacity. Cracks may also develop in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
