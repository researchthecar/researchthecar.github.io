The 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche 2500 is a full-size pickup truck known for its unique Midgate design, allowing the bed to be extended into the cab. It was available with a single engine option, the 8.1L Vortec V8 producing approximately 340 horsepower and 455 lb-ft of torque, and it was paired with the Allison 1000 5-speed automatic transmission.
