**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (LB7)**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: LB7 Duramax engines are known for injector failures, particularly in the early years of production. Symptoms include rough idling, white smoke from the exhaust, reduced power, and fuel in the engine oil. This can eventually lead to engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on labor rates and whether all injectors are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Filter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel filter housing can develop leaks, leading to hard starting, poor performance, and fuel odors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the fuel filter housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Glow plugs can fail, making cold starts difficult or impossible, especially in colder climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty glow plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec Gasoline V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 8.1L Vortec engines can exhibit excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, possible solutions range from replacing valve seals to piston rings, or even a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and required repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold bolts are prone to breaking, causing exhaust leaks and a ticking sound, especially when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison Automatic Transmissions (All Versions)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can manifest as slipping, shuddering, or complete loss of power transfer.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty shift solenoids can cause harsh or erratic shifting, or the transmission may get stuck in a particular gear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty shift solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heavy-duty leaf springs can sag over time, especially with frequent heavy loads. This can lead to a rough ride, reduced load capacity, and potential safety concerns.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ball joints and tie rod ends are subjected to a lot of stress and can wear out, leading to loose steering, wandering, and abnormal tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on how many components need to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Chafing/Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the truck's work environment, wiring harnesses can be exposed to harsh conditions, leading to chafing, corrosion, and electrical shorts. This can cause a wide range of issues from lights not working to engine performance problems.
