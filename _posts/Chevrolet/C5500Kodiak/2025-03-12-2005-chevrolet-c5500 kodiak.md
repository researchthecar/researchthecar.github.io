Engine problems, particularly with the Duramax injectors and Vortec exhaust manifolds, can be costly. Transmission issues, especially with the Allison 1000's torque converter and the 4L80E's hard shifting, are also common concerns. Suspension wear, electrical glitches, and rust are typical age-related problems. Overall, potential buyers should be prepared for maintenance and repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major overhauls. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
