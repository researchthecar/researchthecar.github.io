The 2006 Chevrolet C5500 Kodiak is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial use. This robust workhorse was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options to suit different needs. Engine choices included the 6.6L Duramax Diesel (LBZ), the 8.1L Vortec gas engine. The 6.6L Duramax Diesel (LBZ) produces 360 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. These trucks are generally appreciated for their towing capacity and durability, but some owners have noted issues with the emissions systems on the diesel models and the overall cost of maintenance.

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet C5500 Kodiak, while a capable work truck, is prone to certain issues based on the engine and transmission configuration. The Duramax diesel can suffer from expensive fuel injector and emissions system problems, while the Vortec can have exhaust and oil consumption issues. The Allison transmission is generally robust but can develop torque converter problems. Suspension components wear due to the heavy-duty nature of the truck. Electrical gremlins and rust are also potential concerns. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs, which can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
