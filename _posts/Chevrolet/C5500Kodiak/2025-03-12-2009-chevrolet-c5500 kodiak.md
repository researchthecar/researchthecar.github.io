The 2009 Chevrolet Kodiak C5500 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial purposes like towing, hauling, and service work. The truck's popularity stems from its ruggedness, work-ready capabilities, and relatively simple mechanical design for the time. Owners often appreciate its strong towing capacity and comfortable cabin. However, some common complaints revolve around its fuel economy (especially with the Duramax diesel), ride quality (typical of a heavy-duty truck), and potential maintenance costs associated with its heavy-duty components. For the 2009 C5500 Kodiak, engine options included the 6.0L Vortec gasoline engine, and the 6.6L Duramax diesel. Transmission options generally included the Allison 1000 series automatic transmission. The 6.0L gasoline engine produced around 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque, while the 6.6L Duramax could produce 330+ horsepower and 620+ lb-ft of torque depending on the specific tuning.
