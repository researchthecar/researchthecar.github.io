The 2008 Chevrolet C5500 Kodiak is a medium-duty truck known for its robust build and utility. It was a popular choice for commercial applications like towing, construction, and delivery. Engine options include the 6.6L Duramax diesel, the 8.1L Vortec gas, and the 6.0L Vortec gas. Transmissions included the Allison 1000 automatic with varying speeds based on the engine, and the Eaton manual. Owners often appreciate the Kodiak's strong towing capacity and overall durability. However, common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the gas engines), ride comfort (typical of a heavy-duty truck), and some specific issues with the Duramax diesel engine.

**Summary**

The 2008 Chevrolet C5500 Kodiak, while a capable and durable truck, is susceptible to several common issues. The Duramax diesel engine can experience expensive injector and turbocharger failures. The Allison transmission, while generally reliable, can suffer from torque converter problems. Suspension and electrical issues are also fairly common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousands of dollars for major engine or transmission overhauls. Rust is also a concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the truck for these potential problems and factor in the cost of repairs when making a purchase decision.
