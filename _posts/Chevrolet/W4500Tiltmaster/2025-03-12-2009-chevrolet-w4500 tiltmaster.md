The 2009 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster is a cab-over truck often used for delivery, utility, and service applications. The primary engine option for this model year is the Isuzu 4HK1-TC 5.2L Turbo Diesel engine, producing around 200 horsepower and 441 lb-ft of torque. A popular choice for its maneuverability and payload capacity, the W4500 is praised for its easy access to the engine for maintenance due to its tilt-cab design. However, owners sometimes complain about parts availability and the overall ride quality. The Aisin A465 6-speed automatic transmission is commonly paired with this engine.
