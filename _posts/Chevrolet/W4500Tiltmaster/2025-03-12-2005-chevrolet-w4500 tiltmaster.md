The 2005 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster is a medium-duty cab-over truck primarily used for commercial applications. It was offered with a 5.7L V8 gasoline engine (approximately 295 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque) and a 4.8L Turbo Diesel engine (approximately 175 hp and 387 lb-ft of torque) paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. The W4500 is generally appreciated for its maneuverability and ease of access in urban environments due to its cab-over design. However, some common dislikes include its ride quality (typical of commercial trucks) and potential issues related to its age and the wear and tear associated with commercial use.

**Summary**

The 2005 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster is a workhorse that, like most commercial vehicles, can experience wear and tear with age. Common issues revolve around the engine (especially fuel injectors and turbocharger on the diesel), transmission (slipping or shifting problems), suspension (worn springs and bushings), and electrical systems. Rust can also be a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the severity of the problem, ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of rust, wear, and damage before purchasing, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic familiar with commercial trucks.
