**Summary**

The 2010 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster, while a dependable workhorse, does suffer from several common issues. The most serious concerns involve the diesel engine's emissions systems (DPF, EGR) and potential transmission problems in the automatic variant, which can lead to expensive repairs. Electrical problems, especially wiring harness issues, and suspension wear are also common. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to address (HVAC blower motor), others like DPF replacement or major transmission work, can be quite costly. Rust can also be a significant issue depending on the vehicle's history and geographical location. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, paying close attention to these known problem areas and budgeting for potential maintenance and repairs.
