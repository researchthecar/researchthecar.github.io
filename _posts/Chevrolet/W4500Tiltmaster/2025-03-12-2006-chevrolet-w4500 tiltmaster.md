The 2006 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster is a cab-over-engine (COE) medium-duty truck primarily used for delivery, utility, and service applications. The most common engine option is the 4.8L Isuzu 4HE1-TC turbocharged diesel inline-four, which produces around 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. An Isuzu 4HF1 naturally aspirated diesel inline-four was also available. The standard transmission is an Aisin A465 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the W4500's maneuverability and tight turning radius, which is excellent for urban environments. Dislikes often include the cab's limited space, relatively rough ride, and potential difficulty in sourcing parts specific to Isuzu-sourced components, even though it is sold as a Chevrolet.

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster, while a reliable workhorse, has some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly with the turbocharger and fuel injectors in the 4.8L Isuzu 4HE1-TC engine, and fuel injection pump on the 4.8L Isuzu 4HF1 are potential concerns. Transmission issues, specifically slipping and hard shifts, are also prevalent. Rust, especially in areas with road salt, can be a significant problem. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or extensive rust repair, can be costly, potentially reaching several thousand dollars.
