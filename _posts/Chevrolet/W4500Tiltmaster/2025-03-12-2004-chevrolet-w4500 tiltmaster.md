The 2004 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster is a medium-duty cab-over truck popular for its maneuverability and relatively compact size, making it suitable for urban delivery and service applications. The most common engine option is the Isuzu 4HE1 4.8L Turbo Diesel inline-4 engine producing approximately 175 horsepower and 387 lb-ft of torque. The 4HE1 engine is commonly paired with the Aisin A465 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the truck's excellent visibility and tight turning radius. Some common dislikes include the relatively basic interior, stiffer ride compared to larger trucks, and potential maintenance complexity due to the cab-over design.
