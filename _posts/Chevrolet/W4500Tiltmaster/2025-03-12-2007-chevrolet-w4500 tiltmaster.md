The 2007 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster is a cab-over truck designed for commercial use, often utilized for delivery and service applications. The most common engine is the 4.8L LR4 Vortec gasoline V8 engine, producing around 295 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque. It was also offered with the 5.7L L31 Vortec gasoline V8, making 255 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque and the Isuzu 4HK1-TC 5.2L turbocharged diesel engine which puts out 190 horsepower and 387 lb-ft of torque. These are paired with a variety of transmissions, including Aisin A450 and A465 4-speed automatic transmissions. Owners often appreciate the truck's maneuverability, tight turning radius, and relatively simple maintenance. However, some common complaints include the difficulty of accessing the engine for service due to the cab-over design, parts availability, and the age of the vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.8L LR4 Vortec Gasoline V8**
* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Can be related to worn valve seals, piston rings, or PCV system issues.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the oil consumption (leak test, compression test). Repair or replace the worn components (valve seals, piston rings, PCV valve).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the cause and extent of repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.7L L31 Vortec Gasoline V8**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak near the rear of the intake manifold, rough running engine, white smoke from exhaust (if coolant enters combustion chamber).
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Ensure proper torqueing sequence during installation.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Isuzu 4HK1-TC 5.2L Turbocharged Diesel**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, illuminated check engine light, reduced engine power, potential for "limp mode". Can be caused by a faulty DPF sensor, excessive soot buildup, or injector issues.
    * Solution: Diagnose the cause of the DPF issues. Attempt a forced regeneration of the DPF. Replace the DPF if it is excessively clogged or damaged. Address any underlying issues causing excessive soot production (e.g., faulty injectors).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+ (depending on the cause and whether DPF replacement is needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from exhaust, potential for engine damage.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s). Replace the injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin A450/A465 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, particularly when hot.
    * Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. Perform a transmission service (fluid and filter change). If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during acceleration. Stalling when coming to a stop.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter. A transmission rebuild may also be necessary if debris from the failed torque converter has contaminated the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Noticeable sag on one side. Cracks visible in the leaf springs. Reduced ride quality.
    * Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,500+ (depending on whether one or both sides need replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in turns, poor handling.
    * Solution: Replace the shocks/struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, gauges malfunctioning, or engine stalling. Can be caused by chafed or corroded wiring.
    * Solution: Inspect the wiring harness for damage. Repair or replace damaged sections of the wiring harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days, even when the vehicle is not in use. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component.
    * Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the battery drain. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame, body panels, and undercarriage, particularly in areas exposed to road salt.
    * Solution: Remove surface rust and apply rust inhibitor. For severe rust, replacement of affected panels or frame repair may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**

**Summary:**

The 2007 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster can experience various issues, with engine and transmission problems potentially being the most expensive to repair. DPF issues on the diesel engine and torque converter failures are particularly costly. Rust is also a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive (e.g., blower motor replacement), others can be quite extensive, such as engine or transmission rebuilds. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle for rust, check the service history, and be prepared for potential repairs related to the engine, transmission, and suspension systems.
