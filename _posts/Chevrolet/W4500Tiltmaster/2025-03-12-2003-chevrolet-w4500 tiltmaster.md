The 2003 Chevrolet W4500 Tiltmaster is a medium-duty cab-over truck, popular for its maneuverability and versatility in urban environments. It was primarily equipped with a 4.8L Isuzu 4HE1-TC turbo diesel engine producing around 175 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed Aisin manual transmission was the standard offering, and a 4-speed Aisin automatic was optional. Owners often appreciate the truck's ease of access for maintenance and its tight turning radius. However, some common complaints revolve around the engine's relatively low power output for heavier loads and the age-related issues that affect older work trucks, such as corrosion and wear of components.
