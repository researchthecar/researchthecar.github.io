The 2000 Chevrolet C7500 Kodiak is a medium-duty truck built for a variety of commercial applications. Common engine options included the Caterpillar 3126 diesel and the gasoline-powered 8.1L Vortec V8. The Caterpillar 3126 was offered in multiple horsepower ratings, typically ranging from 175 to 330 horsepower with torque figures from 420 to 860 lb-ft. Transmission options include manual and automatic transmissions depending on the configuration chosen by the customer. Owners often appreciate the Kodiak for its ruggedness and hauling capability but may find the ride less refined compared to modern trucks and the fuel economy can be poor, especially with the gasoline engine.
