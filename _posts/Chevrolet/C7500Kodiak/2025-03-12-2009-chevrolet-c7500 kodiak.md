The 2009 Chevrolet C7500 Kodiak is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications like hauling, towing, and utility work. It was available with a Duramax diesel engine in a couple of configurations and an Allison automatic transmission, making it a robust workhorse. The Kodiak is generally appreciated for its reliability, high towing capacity, and ample cargo space. Common complaints include its large size and difficulty maneuvering in tight spaces, as well as the higher maintenance costs associated with a medium-duty truck.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Diesel (LMM)**
* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, excessive smoke, decreased fuel economy, possible engine knock. Can be caused by fuel contamination or normal wear and tear.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure balanced fuel delivery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (depending on labor rates and if all injectors are replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, possible engine overheating.  The EGR cooler can crack and leak coolant into the exhaust system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler. It's also wise to inspect the EGR valve for excessive carbon buildup and clean or replace it as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Lack of power, excessive black smoke, whistling noises from the turbocharger, possible engine codes related to turbocharger performance.  Can be caused by oil starvation, contamination, or wear and tear on the turbocharger bearings.
    * Solution: Turbocharger replacement or rebuild. Inspect oil supply lines and intercooler for damage or blockage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**8.1L Vortec Gas (L18)**
* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 Series**
* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, poor fuel economy, difficulty shifting, transmission slipping.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Inspect the transmission fluid for contamination and flush the transmission cooler lines.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement of gears, transmission slipping, erratic shifting patterns. The valve body contains solenoids and valves that control fluid flow within the transmission.
    * Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild. Check the transmission fluid level and condition.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sag/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, rough ride, reduced load capacity. Leaf springs are prone to sagging or cracking over time, especially with heavy use.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is regularly used for heavy loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (per axle)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll during turns.
    * Solution: Replacement of shocks/struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, gauges malfunctioning, or starting problems.  Wiring harnesses can become damaged due to exposure to heat, vibration, and environmental factors.
    * Solution: Inspection and repair of damaged wiring.  Replace entire harness if damage is extensive.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty ABS Sensors**
    * Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminated, erratic ABS activation, loss of ABS function.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty ABS sensors. Clean the sensor mounting surfaces and check the wheel bearings for excessive play.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per sensor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially in areas prone to salt exposure like around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and frame.
    * Solution: Rust repair and prevention, including sanding, patching, and applying rust inhibitor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity and location of the rust)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent or no airflow from the HVAC vents.
    * Solution: Replacement of the blower motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet C7500 Kodiak, while a capable work truck, can experience issues common to medium-duty vehicles. The most prevalent concerns revolve around the 6.6L Duramax diesel engine, particularly fuel injector and EGR cooler failures, and transmission problems with the Allison 1000 series. Suspension and electrical issues can also arise, contributing to overall maintenance costs. Rust is a significant factor in regions where road salt is used. Repair costs range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission overhauls, making thorough inspection and preventive maintenance crucial for long-term reliability.
