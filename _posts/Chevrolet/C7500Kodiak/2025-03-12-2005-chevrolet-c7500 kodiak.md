The 2005 Chevrolet C7500 Kodiak is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications. It offered several engine and transmission options to suit different needs. Some commonly available engines included the Duramax 6.6L diesel, producing around 300-330 horsepower and 520-650 lb-ft of torque, and the Vortec 8.1L gasoline engine, producing around 325 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included Allison automatics like the 1000 series. Owners generally appreciate the truck's robust build and capabilities for hauling and towing. Common complaints often revolved around fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), ride comfort, and some recurring maintenance issues.
**Engine**

    *   Description/Symptoms: The variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) can experience issues with the vanes sticking, causing reduced boost and performance, or even complete turbo failure.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the turbocharger vanes, replacing the turbocharger actuator, or replacing the entire turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Vortec 8.1L Gasoline**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Common issue where the exhaust manifold bolts break, causing exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking noise, reduced fuel economy, and potential damage to the exhaust manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts. May require removing the exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on labor and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption with the 8.1L Vortec, especially as the engine ages.
    *   Solution: Address any leaks, consider using a heavier weight oil, or rebuild/replace the engine if consumption is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Variable, depending on the cause of consumption, ranging from $100 (for leaks) to $5,000+ (for rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 Series Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter clutch failure is a common issue, leading to shuddering during lockup, poor fuel economy, and eventually complete torque converter failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty shift solenoids can cause erratic shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, or harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Loss of Pressure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of hydraulic pressure can cause slipping, delayed engagement, and eventually transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair or replace the transmission pump, seals, and valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the cause and extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heavy-duty leaf springs can sag over time, especially with frequent heavy loads. Broken leaf springs can also occur. This leads to poor ride quality, reduced load capacity, and potential safety hazards.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs for improved performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per axle, depending on the type of springs and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the weight and usage of the vehicle, ball joints and tie rod ends wear out prematurely, causing loose steering, vibrations, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and tie rod ends. Perform a wheel alignment after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per axle, including alignment.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
