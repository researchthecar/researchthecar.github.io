### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet C7500 Kodiak, particularly with its Caterpillar diesel engine options, is generally a robust truck built for demanding work. Common issues tend to revolve around the fuel system, turbochargers, and transmission components, especially under heavy or continuous use. Suspension components like leaf springs and bushings can also require attention due to the vehicle's weight capacity. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure and wiring harness problems, are not uncommon in older heavy-duty vehicles. While the gasoline V8 offers an alternative, diesel variants are more prevalent for this class. Proactive maintenance, especially fluid changes and inspections of the powertrain and suspension, is crucial for maximizing the longevity and reliability of these workhorses.
