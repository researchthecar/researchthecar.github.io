The 2002 Chevrolet C7500 Kodiak is a medium-duty truck known for its versatility and capability in commercial applications. Available engine options include the Vortec 8100 8.1L V8 gasoline engine (rated around 340 hp and 455 lb-ft of torque), as well as various diesel engines from Caterpillar and Duramax. Transmission options typically included Allison automatic transmissions and manual transmissions depending on the specific configuration. Owners often praise the Kodiak for its robust build, strong towing capacity, and suitability for various upfits (dump trucks, flatbeds, etc.). Common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), ride quality (inherent to medium-duty trucks), and potential maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty components.

    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Duramax Diesel (Specific Engine Code Needed for Accurate Information, e.g., LB7, LLY, etc.)**

*(Without a specific Duramax engine code, providing generalized diesel engine issues common to this era is the best approach):*

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, white smoke from exhaust, decreased fuel economy, potential for cylinder damage.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. Requires specialized tools and knowledge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found (Unless specific to the engine code, investigate based on engine code)

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive smoke on startup.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty glow plugs and potentially the glow plug control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found (Unless specific to the engine code, investigate based on engine code)

**Transmission**

**Allison Automatic Transmissions (Specific Model Needed for Accurate Information, e.g., 1000, 2000 series, etc.)**

*(Without a specific Allison transmission model, providing generalized Allison transmission issues common to this era is the best approach):*

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or erratic shifts, engine revving excessively between gears.
    *   Solution: Requires diagnosis to determine the cause, which could include worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or a faulty torque converter. A rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $6000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found (Unless specific to the transmission model, investigate based on transmission model)

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, poor acceleration, transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found (Unless specific to the transmission model, investigate based on transmission model)

**Manual Transmissions**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, unusual noises when pressing the clutch pedal.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.  Consider resurfacing the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leans to one side, poor ride quality, noticeable sagging of the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle (depending on the complexity and if shocks are replaced at the same time)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, clunking noises from the front end, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on how many parts are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery not charging, dim headlights, warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**

**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet C7500 Kodiak, while a robust and capable medium-duty truck, is prone to issues related to its age and heavy-duty usage. Engine issues (especially with the gasoline Vortec and the Duramax diesels) and transmission problems can be costly to repair. Suspension components wear out over time, and electrical issues can be challenging to diagnose. Rust is a common concern, particularly in regions with road salt. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and budget for potential repairs. The severity of the issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
