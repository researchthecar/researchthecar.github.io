The 2005 Chevrolet Astro is a rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive cargo and passenger van powered by a 4.3L Vortec 4300 V6 engine, producing 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. It was only offered with a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Astro's versatility for hauling cargo and passengers, its relatively compact size for a van, and its available all-wheel drive. However, common complaints included lackluster fuel economy, dated interior design, and certain reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2005 Chevrolet Astro, while versatile, is prone to several common issues related to its age and design. Engine issues, such as intake manifold gasket failures and fuel injector problems, can be costly to address. Transmission problems with the 4L60E, especially slipping, can also be a major concern. Suspension issues like leaf spring sagging are expected on vehicles of this age. Electrical issues and rust are also fairly common. The severity and cost of these repairs vary widely, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems.
