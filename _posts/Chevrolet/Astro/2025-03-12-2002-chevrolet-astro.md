The 2002 Chevrolet Astro is a versatile and practical minivan known for its spacious interior, truck-like towing capacity, and rear-wheel-drive (or all-wheel-drive) configuration. It offered a blend of utility and passenger comfort, making it a popular choice for families and commercial use. A major advantage to the Astro is it's compact size which allows it to fit in most garages and parking spots. What owners disliked about the vehicle included its fuel economy, aging design, and the fact that it was starting to fall behind competitors in terms of features and refinement. The 2002 Astro came standard with a 4.3L Vortec V6 engine producing 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. No other engine options were available.
