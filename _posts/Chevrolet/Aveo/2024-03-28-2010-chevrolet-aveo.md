**Introduction:**

The 2010 Chevrolet Aveo is a subcompact car offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine is a 1.6-liter four-cylinder that produces 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder that produces 122 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.
