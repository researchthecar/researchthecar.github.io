The 2013 Chevrolet Aveo, also known as the Sonic in some markets, is a subcompact car that aimed to provide fuel efficiency and affordability. It was offered with a 1.6L Inline-4 engine, producing around 100 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. The Aveo's appeal lay in its low price point and relatively spacious interior for its class. Common criticisms revolved around its lackluster performance, somewhat unrefined ride, and build quality. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic.
