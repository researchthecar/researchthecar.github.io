### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet Aveo presents a mixed reliability profile. Its 1.6L engine can suffer from common issues like oil and coolant leaks, which are often repairable with gasket or seal replacements. The manual transmission is generally more robust, though clutch wear is a typical concern. Automatic transmissions may exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components such as ball joints, tie rods, and strut mounts are known to wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical problems, notably alternator failures and window regulator issues, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on climate. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and door lock actuators are common failure points. Overall, while the Aveo is an economical choice, owners should be prepared for potential repairs in these specific areas.
