The 2006 Chevrolet Aveo was a subcompact car offered as a sedan and a hatchback. It was known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. However, it was also criticized for its somewhat lackluster performance, basic interior, and reliability issues. The 2006 Aveo came with a 1.6L inline-4 engine producing 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Aveo's low price point and decent gas mileage, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. Conversely, common complaints revolved around its lack of power, build quality, and frequent mechanical problems.
