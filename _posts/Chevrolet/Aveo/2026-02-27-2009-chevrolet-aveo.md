### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet Aveo presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around leaks (oil and coolant) from the engine, wear and tear on suspension components like struts and ball joints, and some electrical gremlins such as alternator failures and power window problems. The manual transmission generally holds up better than the automatic, which can exhibit harsh shifting. Exterior rust can be a concern, particularly in areas with harsh weather. Interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure and dashboard cracking are also reported. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these common problem areas, especially as the vehicle ages.
