### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Chevrolet Aveo presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core powertrain components are generally robust, owners have reported issues primarily related to oil and coolant leaks from the 1.6L engine, and some transmission concerns with the automatic gearbox, such as harsh shifting. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear over time, leading to ride quality and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly power window motors and battery drain, are also noted. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and door lock actuators are occasional points of failure. Exterior elements appear to be less problematic. Overall, the Aveo requires attention to common wear items and specific electrical/mechanical issues to maintain optimal reliability.
