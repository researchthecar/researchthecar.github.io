The 2014 Chevrolet Aveo, also known as the Sonic in some markets, is a subcompact car that aims for fuel efficiency and affordability. It was offered with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine, producing about 100 horsepower and 92 lb-ft of torque. A selling point for many owners is its relatively spacious interior for its class, and its nimble handling.
