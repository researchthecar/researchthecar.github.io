The 2009 Chevrolet Aveo is a subcompact car that was known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It came standard with a 1.6-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing about 106 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. The Aveo offered either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. While the Aveo was inexpensive to buy and operate, it was often criticized for its lackluster performance, unrefined ride quality, and somewhat cheap interior materials. Owners appreciated the low price point and decent fuel economy, but disliked the lack of power and reliability concerns.
