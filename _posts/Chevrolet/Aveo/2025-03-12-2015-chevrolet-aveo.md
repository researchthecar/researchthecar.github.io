The 2015 Chevrolet Aveo, also known as the Sonic in some markets, is a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It was offered with a single engine option: a 1.6L Inline-4 producing around 100 horsepower and 108 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciated the Aveo/Sonic for its nimble handling, spacious interior relative to its size, and low price point. However, common criticisms included the engine's lack of power, somewhat unrefined ride, and the presence of cheaper interior materials.
