### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Aveo presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's propensity for oil and coolant leaks, particularly as mileage increases. Transmission problems, both manual clutch wear and automatic shifting issues, are also frequently reported. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear prematurely, impacting handling and tire life. Electrical gremlins, such as alternator failures and power window malfunctions, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant concern in certain climates. While the Aveo is an economical choice, potential buyers should be aware of these recurring problems and factor in potential repair costs for these specific components.
