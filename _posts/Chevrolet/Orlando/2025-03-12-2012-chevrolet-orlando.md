The 2012 Chevrolet Orlando is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) that aimed to offer a blend of practicality and affordability. In North America, the Orlando was only available with a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 engine producing 174 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual (very rare) and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Orlando's spacious interior, flexible seating configurations, and value for money. However, some common dislikes included its somewhat unrefined driving experience, limited engine choices, and reports of certain reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil more often than usual, blue smoke from the exhaust (in severe cases), and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Chevrolet has issued updated piston rings to address this issue. A compression test and leak-down test can help determine the extent of the problem. Replacing the piston rings is a common repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The purge valve is part of the evaporative emission control system (EVAP), which prevents fuel vapors from escaping into the atmosphere. A failing purge valve can cause a variety of symptoms, including a check engine light (typically with codes related to EVAP system leaks or flow issues), rough idling, difficulty starting the engine, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to replace the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T40)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or a complete loss of drive. These issues can be intermittent or become progressively worse over time.
    *   Solution: Potential causes include low transmission fluid, contaminated transmission fluid, worn or damaged valve body, or internal component failure. A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may resolve the issue in some cases. However, more severe cases may require a valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) to $3,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, resulting in a dead battery or difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of a parasitic drain can be complex. Possible culprits include a faulty alternator, a malfunctioning electrical component that is not turning off properly, or a short circuit. A thorough electrical system check is required to identify the source of the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (simple fix) to $500+ (complex diagnosis and repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning power windows, including windows that operate intermittently, fail to operate at all, or get stuck.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag light illuminated on the dashboard due to a faulty sensor.
    *   Solution: The sensors will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Orlando, while offering practicality and value, has some known issues. The most concerning are the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine and transmission problems with the 6T40 automatic. Electrical issues can also be problematic. The severity and cost of these repairs can vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
