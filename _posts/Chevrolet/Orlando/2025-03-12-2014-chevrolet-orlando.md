Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 Chevrolet Orlando, formatted for your website.

The 2014 Chevrolet Orlando is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) or crossover marketed towards families looking for a versatile and affordable option. Engine options for the 2014 Orlando in North America included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 174 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 259 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Orlando for its spacious interior, flexible seating configurations, and value for money. Common criticisms include its somewhat uninspired styling, average fuel economy (especially with the turbocharged engine), and some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, engine knocking, and potential engine damage if not addressed. The oil consumption is happening because the piston rings don't seal correctly causing excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with installing updated piston rings and pistons. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to the evaporative emission (EVAP) system. Can cause rough idling, stalling, or difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the purge solenoid valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling or grinding noises from the engine, check engine light. This could be due to oil starvation of the turbo, or a failing actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the turbocharger. Diagnose the root cause of the failure (e.g., oil supply issues) to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears. Transmission slipping, where the engine revs but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly. Sometimes accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with transmission fluid changes. More serious cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3,500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially when the torque converter is locking up. May also cause stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. Can cause a rough ride and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs or installation of aftermarket air springs or helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
