**Summary**

The 2013 Chevrolet Orlando has several potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption and purge valve failure, can lead to moderate to high repair costs. Transmission issues, including harsh shifting and torque converter problems, also present a risk of significant expenses.
