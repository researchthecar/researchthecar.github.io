Engine options for this model year include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque), the 6.0L Vortec V8 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) (301 hp, 333 lb-ft of torque), and the legendary 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (365 hp, 660 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included the 6L90 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Silverado 3500HD for its robust performance, especially when equipped with the Duramax diesel, and its workhorse nature. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, some electrical issues, and ride quality, particularly when unloaded.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (LMM)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, white smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine misfires. Can lead to cylinder damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector (labor included). Replacing all injectors is generally recommended for a more reliable fix, which can push the cost to $3,000 - $6,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The CP4 high-pressure fuel pump is known to fail because of its design. Contaminated fuel will cause the pump to grenade itself and send metal shavings into the fuel system.
    * Solution: Replace the CP4 pump with a more reliable alternative pump (such as the CP3), replace all fuel rails, and injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption without visible leaks. May lead to fouled spark plugs and catalytic converter issues.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a PCV valve replacement can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: PCV valve replacement $50-$150; Piston ring replacement $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8 CNG**
    * No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration, particularly at highway speeds. Can also trigger a "Check Engine" light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter may provide temporary relief.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Torque converter replacement $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifts, delayed engagement, or slipping between gears. Often related to worn clutches or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. Valve body repair may be sufficient in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve body repair $500 - $1,000; Transmission rebuild $2,500 - $4,500; Transmission replacement $3,500 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially when loaded. Visible cracks in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200 per side.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Upper Control Arm Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noise while driving, loose steering feel. Excessive play in the ball joint when inspected.
    *   Solution: Replace the upper control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side (parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic gauge readings, dim or non-functional displays, and complete instrument cluster failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Repair $200 - $500; Replacement $500 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues such as power window failure, door lock malfunction, or lighting problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reprogramming of the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Reprogramming $100-$300; Replacement $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Wheel Arch Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower wheel arches, particularly on the rear.

**Summary**

The 2010 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD, while a capable truck, has its share of potential issues. The most concerning, and potentially expensive, relate to the Duramax diesel engine, particularly fuel injector and CP4 pump failure. Transmission problems with the 6L90, especially TCC failure, are also common. Electrical gremlins related to the instrument cluster and BCM can be frustrating to diagnose and repair. While some issues like suspension wear and seat heater failures are relatively minor, addressing major engine or transmission problems can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect any used 2010 Silverado 3500HD before purchase.
