    *   Description/Symptoms: The LLY Duramax engine is known for overheating, especially when towing or under heavy load.
    *   Solution: Inspect the cooling system components such as radiator, water pump, thermostat, and fan clutch. Upgrading to a higher-capacity radiator and adding an aftermarket coolant temperature sensor can help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the components that need to be replaced or upgraded)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, white or black smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and possible engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector installed.

**Transmission**

**4L80E (4-Speed Automatic)**

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears or shifts harshly.
    *   Solution: This is often due to worn clutch packs or a failing valve body. A full transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Allison 1000 (5-Speed Automatic)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering, clunking noises from the front end, and uneven tire wear. Ball joints, tie rod ends, and pitman arms are common wear items.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints, tie rod ends, and/or pitman arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per component, depending on whether you replace one side or both)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**

**Summary**

The 2005 Chevrolet Silverado 3500, while a reliable work truck, does exhibit some common issues, particularly related to the age of the vehicle and its heavy-duty usage. Engine issues, such as oil consumption in the 6.0L Vortec, exhaust manifold bolts breaking on the 8.1L Vortec, and overheating in the 6.6L Duramax LLY can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially slipping in the 4L80E or torque converter failure in the Allison 1000, can also be significant expenses. Suspension and electrical problems add to the potential maintenance costs. Rust, as well as interior issues, are common in older vehicles, also creating some cost to repair. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and consider the potential for these repairs when evaluating the purchase.
