The 2016 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp and 380 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (397 hp and 765 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options consist of the 6L90 six-speed automatic transmission for the 6.0L V8 and the Allison 1000 six-speed automatic transmission for the 6.6L Duramax. Owners often praise its robust build, strong towing power, and comfortable interior (depending on the trim level). Common dislikes include the ride quality, which can be stiff, and some reported issues with the emissions systems in the diesel models.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**
* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, misfires, reduced power, and potential engine damage. This is often caused by the AFM lifters collapsing.
    * Solution: Replace failed lifters, often recommended to replace all lifters while the engine is open. Some owners disable the AFM system through tuning or hardware modifications to prevent future failures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (LML)**

* **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: "Service Exhaust Fluid System" message, reduced engine power, and potential engine shutdown. Common causes include a faulty DEF injector, DEF pump, DEF level sensor, or NOx sensor.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific component failure using a scan tool and replace the faulty part. Sometimes, software updates can address sensor issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the component needing replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, white or black smoke from the exhaust, and decreased fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replace the failed fuel injector(s). It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time, as others may fail soon.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+ depending on how many injectors need replaced and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, no start condition, metal shavings in the fuel system. This is a known weakness of the CP4 pump, especially when contaminated fuel is used.
    * Solution: Replace the CP4 pump and thoroughly flush the entire fuel system to remove any metal debris. Some owners upgrade to a more robust CP3 pump to prevent future failures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $10,000+ depending on severity of the damage and if upgrading the pump.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed (Paired with 6.6L Duramax)**

* **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations during lockup, slipping, and eventually complete failure to engage.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, getting stuck in a gear, or failure to shift.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6L90 6-Speed (Paired with 6.0L Vortec)**
* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift.
    * Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**
* **Leaf Spring Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging in the rear, reduced load capacity, and potential for bottoming out.
    * Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, requiring frequent jump starts. Caused by parasitic draw from faulty modules or aftermarket accessories.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, rebooting, no audio, or loss of functionality.
    * Solution: Software updates, replacement of the radio unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2016 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD can be a reliable workhorse, but it's essential to be aware of potential issues. The 6.6L Duramax engine is prone to some expensive failures that should be inspected before purchasing. Some issues, like DEF system faults and electrical problems, are relatively inexpensive to fix. However, others, like fuel injector failure and CP4 pump issues in the Duramax, can be very costly. The 6.0L vortec engine is prone to AFM lifter failures which can cause engine misfires. Regular maintenance and careful inspection of the vehicle's history can help mitigate these risks.
