The 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Available engine options include a 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque and a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8 engine producing 397 horsepower and 765 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline engine is paired with a 6L90 6-speed automatic transmission, while the Duramax diesel is paired with an Allison 1000 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the truck's strong engine performance, comfortable ride for a heavy-duty vehicle, and functional interior. Common complaints often involve electrical glitches, some engine-related issues (particularly with the diesel), and concerns about the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, engine misfires, rough idling. The AFM system can cause lifter failure leading to these issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Disabling the AFM system is also a common preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbodiesel V8 (LML)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, white smoke from the exhaust, reduced fuel economy, and potential engine knocking. This generation of Duramax is known for fuel injector issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s). It's often recommended to replace all injectors simultaneously to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+ per injector (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, no-start condition, metallic debris in the fuel system. The CP4 pump is known to be less robust than earlier Duramax fuel pumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CP4 pump and thoroughly cleaning the entire fuel system to remove any debris. Some owners opt for a CP3 conversion for increased reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (CP4 Replacement), $5,000-$8,000 (CP3 Conversion)
    *   Recalls: None Found
* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, engine overheating, rough running.
    * Solution: Replacing the EGR cooler.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed (Paired with 6.6L Duramax)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, transmission slipping, difficulty shifting gears, and potentially a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. Often recommended to rebuild the transmission at the same time to address any other potential wear and tear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (includes torque converter and transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6L90 6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.0L Vortec)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, transmission slipping, difficulty shifting gears, and potentially a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. Often recommended to rebuild the transmission at the same time to address any other potential wear and tear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (includes torque converter and transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potential cracking of the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs is a common option for those who frequently tow or haul heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, including malfunctioning power windows, door locks, lights, and other accessories.
    *   Solution: Replacing the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Radio/Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available) or replacing the radio unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software updates, if available), $500 - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Cab Corner Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower cab corners, especially in areas with road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repairing the rusted areas or replacing the affected body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the dashboard, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (replacement), $50 - $200 (cover)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD has some common issues, with the most significant being engine-related, particularly for the Duramax diesel, and electrical glitches. The CP4 fuel pump on the diesel and electrical problems present the most potentially severe and costly repairs. While the gasoline engine is generally more reliable, AFM lifter failure can still be a major expense. Rust on the cab corners is another concern. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the truck, especially focusing on engine performance, electrical system functionality, and signs of rust. Prior maintenance records are highly valuable to assess the vehicle's history.
