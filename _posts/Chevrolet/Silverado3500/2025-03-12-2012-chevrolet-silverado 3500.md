The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Available engine options included a 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine and a 6.6L Duramax turbodiesel V8. The 6.0L V8 produced 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. A popular choice for those needing serious power, the Duramax diesel generated 397 horsepower and 765 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the truck's robust build, strong towing capacity, and comfortable ride for a heavy-duty vehicle. Common complaints include fuel economy (particularly with the gasoline engine), some electrical gremlins, and the overall cost of maintenance and repairs associated with a heavy-duty truck.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (Gasoline)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can experience lifter failure. This leads to misfires, a ticking or knocking sound from the engine, and potential damage to the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, leading to the need for frequent oil top-offs. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and fouled spark plugs.
    *   Solution: The fix varies depending on the cause, ranging from replacing the valve stem seals to piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax LML V8 (Diesel)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Bosch common rail fuel injectors in the LML Duramax are known to sometimes fail, leading to rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per injector (includes labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 high-pressure fuel pump is known to fail due to poor fuel quality and the lack of lubricity, resulting in metal contamination in the fuel system. Symptoms include hard starting, no start, reduced power, and potential damage to injectors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CP4 pump and cleaning or replacing the entire fuel system in extreme cases. Many owners will also add a lubricity additive to the fuel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $10,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, leading to reduced performance, poor fuel economy, and the "Exhaust Filter Full" message. Frequent short trips and low-speed driving exacerbate this issue.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF (either through the truck's system or a shop) or replacement of the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+ (depending on cleaning vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **Allison 1000 6-Speed Automatic (Common to both engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, difficulty shifting, or slipping. May also result in the truck lurching forward when stopped.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It may be necessary to replace the transmission if damage has occured.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, or failure to shift into certain gears. The check engine light may illuminate with transmission-related codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Loose steering feel and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic electrical behavior, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, lights, or wipers. Can also affect the starting system.
    *   Solution: Reprogramming or replacing the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Trailer Wiring Harness Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning trailer lights (brake, turn signal, running lights) and potential issues with trailer brakes. Corrosion and damaged wiring are common causes.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the trailer wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per side (depending on the extent of the damage and paint matching)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in warmer climates with high sun exposure.

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD, while a capable workhorse, can be prone to certain issues. Engine problems, particularly with the Duramax diesel (fuel injectors and CP4 pump), can be costly to repair. Electrical issues related to the BCM are also a concern. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with potential costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the problem and the chosen solution. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection to check for these common problems.
