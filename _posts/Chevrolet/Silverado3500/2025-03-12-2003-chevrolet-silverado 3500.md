The 2003 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 is a heavy-duty truck appreciated for its towing capacity and robust build. Engine options include the 6.0L Vortec V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque), the 8.1L Vortec V8 (340 hp, 455 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (300 hp, 520 lb-ft of torque). Transmission choices typically included a 4-speed automatic (4L80E) for the gasoline engines and a 5-speed Allison automatic for the Duramax diesel. Owners often praise the truck's reliability and workhorse capabilities. Common complaints include rust, especially in areas prone to road salt, and issues related to age and wear on components.

**Summary**

The 2003 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues related to its age, including engine problems (especially injector issues with the LB7 Duramax), transmission wear, rust, and electrical malfunctions.
