The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD is a heavy-duty truck known for its impressive towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 6.0L Vortec V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque) and the formidable 6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (445 hp, 910 lb-ft of torque). The gasoline engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel engine was primarily paired with an Allison 1000 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Silverado 3500HD for its robust build, powerful engine options, and comfortable interior for a work truck. Common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy (especially with the diesel), occasional electrical gremlins, and the higher cost of maintenance and repairs associated with heavy-duty trucks.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Turbo-Diesel V8 (L5P)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, reduced power, excessive smoke (white or black), and potential engine damage. This is more common in earlier production L5P engines (specifically around the 2017 model year) and can sometimes be attributed to poor fuel quality or water intrusion.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed fuel injector(s). It's generally recommended to replace all injectors on that side of the engine if one fails.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per injector, depending on labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete engine failure, metal shavings throughout the fuel system, no start condition. The CP4 pump is known to have had failures in the earlier years.
    *   Solution: Replacing the entire fuel system including the fuel pump, injectors, lines and tank
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8000 - $12000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8 (L96)**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 6-Speed (Diesel Engine)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, particularly under load (towing). Transmission slipping, difficulty shifting, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. Flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ depending on whether the transmission needs to be removed or not.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, slipping between gears, and potential for transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. This may involve replacing solenoids and other components within the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and if the whole valve body needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6L90 6-Speed (Gas Engine)**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially when loaded or towing. Reduced ride quality and handling, unusual noises (clunking or squeaking) from the rear suspension. Visually inspect for broken or cracked leaves in the spring pack.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf spring pack(s). Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for heavy hauling or towing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring pack, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Trailer Brake Controller**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Service Trailer Brake System" message on the dash, intermittent or complete loss of trailer braking functionality. Can be caused by a faulty controller unit, wiring issues, or a problem with the trailer connection.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause (wiring, controller unit, etc.) and replacing the faulty component. Recalibrating the trailer brake controller may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component that needs replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS, Wheel Speed, TPMS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light, Traction Control light, or Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) light illuminated on the dash. Erratic ABS or traction control behavior. Inaccurate tire pressure readings.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific sensor that is failing and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Cab Corner Rust (Northern Climates)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the lower rear corners of the cab, near the bed. This is more prevalent in areas with heavy road salt use.
    *   Solution: Cutting out the rusted section, welding in new metal, and repainting. Prevention involves regular washing and application of rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per side, depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Delaminating Infotainment Screen**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The touch screen on the infotainment system starts to separate or bubble. This can make it difficult to see the display and use the touch screen functions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the infotainment screen or the entire infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on whether you replace the screen or the whole unit.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD is a capable work truck, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The diesel engine can suffer from expensive fuel system problems, especially related to the injectors and the CP4 pump. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also concerns. While some issues, like sensor failures, are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like fuel injector or torque converter failures, can be quite costly. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended, especially on diesel models.
