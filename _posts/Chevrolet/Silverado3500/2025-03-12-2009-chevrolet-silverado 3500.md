The 2009 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. It was offered with a few engine and transmission options, including the 6.0L Vortec V8, the 8.1L Vortec V8, and the 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8, each paired with different automatic transmissions. The 6.0L V8 produced around 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, while the Duramax Diesel produced around 365 horsepower and 660 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the truck's robust build and workhorse nature, but some common complaints revolve around fuel economy, certain electrical issues, and maintenance costs, especially with the diesel engine.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter issues, and ultimately engine damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: Replacing valve seals can help, though a more comprehensive engine rebuild might be necessary in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: AFM, designed to improve fuel economy, can cause oil consumption, lifter failure, and misfires due to deactivated cylinders. Symptoms include rough idle, reduced power, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Disabling AFM via tuning, replacing the AFM lifters with standard lifters, and a potential camshaft replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (LMM)**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The DPF, designed to trap soot, can become clogged, especially with frequent short trips. This leads to reduced performance, poor fuel economy, and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration, cleaning the DPF, or replacement. Many owners opt for DPF delete kits with custom tuning, although this is often illegal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Bosch common rail fuel injectors are prone to failure, leading to rough idling, misfires, and reduced power.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1000 per injector (parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult cold starts. A check engine light may appear.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty glow plugs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 (Paired with 6.6L Duramax)**

* **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during torque converter lockup, slipping, and overheating.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifting, or failure to shift.
    * Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4L80E (Paired with 6.0L Vortec)**

* **4th Gear Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping or complete loss of 4th gear.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, especially when carrying loads. This can affect handling and ride quality.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs, often with aftermarket heavy-duty options.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ball Joint Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gauges not functioning correctly, flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 is a capable truck but can suffer from several issues. Engine issues, particularly with the Duramax diesel (DPF and Injector issues) and the 6.0L Vortec (oil consumption, AFM), can be costly to repair. Transmission problems with both the Allison 1000 and 4L80E are also common. Suspension wear and electrical glitches are also prevalent. Overall, owners should be prepared for potential maintenance expenses, especially with higher mileage vehicles.
