The 2010 Chevrolet Express 4500 is a heavy-duty full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, such as cargo transport, shuttle services, and utility work. It offered several engine choices including the 4.8L Vortec V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), the 6.0L Vortec V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 (260 hp, 525 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Express 4500 for its robust build, ample cargo space, and towing capability. Common complaints include fuel economy, ride comfort, and dated interior design.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2010 Chevrolet Express 4500, while a reliable workhorse, is prone to a number of issues typical of high-mileage work vehicles. Engine oil consumption, particularly with the 4.8L and 6.0L V8 engines, is a common concern, potentially leading to costly repairs. The 6.6L Duramax diesel can face expensive fuel injector failures. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting, may require significant investment. Suspension and electrical problems are also noteworthy. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite severe and costly, making a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing.
