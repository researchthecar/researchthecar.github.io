The 2016 Chevrolet Express 4500 is a heavy-duty full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes such as transporting goods or passengers. Engine options include a 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 342 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque and a 6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8 producing 260 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a heavy-duty 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Express 4500 for its robust build, cargo capacity, and readily available aftermarket upfitting options. Common complaints revolve around its dated design, fuel economy, and relatively basic interior features.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, leading to the need to frequently add oil between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as blue exhaust smoke or a noticeable drop in the oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using the correct viscosity oil. If the problem persists, a mechanic may need to perform a compression test and inspect for leaks or worn piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $3000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can sometimes lead to lifter failure. Symptoms include a persistent ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected lifters and potentially the camshaft. Many owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF is responsible for trapping particulate matter from the diesel exhaust. It can become clogged over time, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and the "Check Engine" light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Performing a forced regeneration of the DPF, cleaning the DPF, or replacing the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (forced regeneration) - $2000+ (DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Diesel fuel injectors can fail due to contamination or wear. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter may experience shuddering, especially at lower speeds or during light acceleration. This feels like a vibration or shaking sensation.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush using a fluid compatible with GM transmissions. Replacing the torque converter may be necessary in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid flush) - $800 - $2000+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Flare**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shift flare is a delay or hesitation during gear changes, where the engine RPMs increase noticeably before the next gear engages.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the issue persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid flush) - $500 - $1500+ (valve body repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy-duty nature of the Express 4500, the leaf springs can sag over time, especially when carrying heavy loads regularly. This results in a lower ride height, reduced load capacity, and potential handling issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with new or upgraded units. Adding helper springs or airbags can also provide additional support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ball joints can wear out, resulting in steering looseness, clunking noises when going over bumps, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuators can fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly using the remote or the interior switches.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, resulting in a dead battery, dim headlights, and potential electrical system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust around Wheel Wells and Rocker Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Chevrolet Express is prone to rust, especially around the wheel wells and rocker panels, particularly in areas with harsh winters and road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Removing the rust, repairing the affected panels, and applying rust protection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor responsible for circulating air through the HVAC system can fail, resulting in a lack of airflow from the vents.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Express 4500, while a capable and versatile work van, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, such as oil consumption and AFM lifter failure (for the 6.0L V8), and DPF/Fuel Injector issues (for the 6.6L Diesel) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues like torque converter shudder and shift flare are also prevalent and should be investigated during a pre-purchase inspection. Suspension, electrical, and rust concerns can add to the overall cost of ownership. The severity and cost of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, making a thorough inspection and maintenance history review essential before purchasing a used 2016 Chevrolet Express 4500.
