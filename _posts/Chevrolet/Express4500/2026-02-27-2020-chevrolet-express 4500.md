### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Chevrolet Express 4500 demonstrates a generally solid reliability profile for a commercial vehicle, particularly with its gasoline powertrains. The most frequently cited issues tend to revolve around the diesel engine's emissions control systems (DPF and EGR) and common wear items on heavy-duty suspensions like leaf springs and steering components. Transmission issues, while not pervasive, can include torque converter problems. Electrical components like the alternator are also potential failure points. For owners, proactive maintenance, especially concerning the diesel exhaust system and regular checks of suspension and steering, can mitigate many potential problems. Overall, it remains a capable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas.
