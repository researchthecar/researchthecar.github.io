**Summary:**

The 2017 Chevrolet Express 4500, while a workhorse, presents owners with a few common issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the 6.0L Vortec and fuel injector/glow plug failures in the 6.6L Duramax, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues like torque converter shudder are also common and can require attention. Suspension sagging and electrical faults add to the list of potential concerns. The severity and cost of these issues range from relatively minor (door rollers, HVAC blower motor) to potentially expensive (engine or transmission repairs). Prospective buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
