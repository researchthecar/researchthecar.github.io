**Summary**
The 2009 Chevrolet Express 4500, while valued for its utility, presents owners with a range of potential issues. Engine-related problems, such as oil consumption and fuel injector failures (especially in the Duramax diesel), can be costly to address. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L80E, are also a concern. Suspension wear and electrical problems are common due to the vehicle's heavy-duty usage. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, such as transmission rebuilds or major engine repairs, can represent significant expenses. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas when considering a used 2009 Express 4500.
