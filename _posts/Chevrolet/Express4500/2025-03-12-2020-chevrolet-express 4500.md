The 2020 Chevrolet Express 4500 is a full-size, heavy-duty van primarily used for commercial purposes such as hauling cargo or passengers. Engine options include a 6.0L Vortec V8 (341 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel I4 (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). The 6.0L V8 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.8L diesel is paired with an 8-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Express 4500 for its ruggedness, payload capacity, and relatively simple design, making it easy to maintain. Common complaints include a dated interior, poor fuel economy (especially with the V8), and basic technology features compared to newer vans.
