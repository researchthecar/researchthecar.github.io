The 2012 Chevrolet Express 4500 is a heavy-duty full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes like cargo hauling, passenger transport, and service vehicles. Available engine options included a 4.8L V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft torque), a 6.0L V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft torque), and a 6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (260 hp, 525 lb-ft torque). The transmissions were either a 4-speed automatic (4L80E) or a 6-speed automatic (6L90E), depending on the engine and configuration. Owners often appreciate the Express 4500 for its robust build, ample cargo space, and straightforward mechanical design, which makes it relatively easy to maintain. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride quality (especially when unloaded), and some recurring electrical and mechanical issues.

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Express 4500, while reliable for its robust construction, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The 6.0L V8 engine is prone to AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. The 6.6L Duramax diesel can suffer from fuel injector and glow plug problems. The 6L90E transmission can have torque converter and shift solenoid issues. Suspension problems include sagging leaf springs and worn ball joints/tie rod ends. Electrical issues such as door lock actuator and instrument cluster failures also occur. Rust around the wheel wells and rocker panels is a common problem in areas with road salt. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but some of the engine and transmission issues can be quite expensive. Checking the vehicle's maintenance history and thoroughly inspecting these areas before purchase is recommended.
