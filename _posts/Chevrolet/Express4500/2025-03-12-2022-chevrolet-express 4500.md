The 2022 Chevrolet Express 4500 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes like cargo hauling, passenger transport, or as a base for upfitting into ambulances or other specialized vehicles. Available engine options for the 2022 model year include a 4.3L V6 (276 hp and 298 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.6L V8 (401 hp and 464 lb-ft of torque). Both are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the van's robust build, high payload capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design, making it easy to maintain. However, some common complaints revolve around the somewhat dated design, less refined ride quality compared to newer vans, and lower fuel efficiency.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6.6L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission exhibits a shudder or vibration, especially during light acceleration at highway speeds. This is often attributed to the torque converter failing to lock up properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter is the most common fix. A transmission flush may temporarily alleviate the issue, but it typically returns.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag prematurely, especially in vehicles consistently loaded near their maximum payload capacity. This results in a reduced ride height in the rear, a bouncy ride, and potential bottoming out. Leaf springs can also crack or break under heavy loads.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs is necessary. Upgrading to heavier-duty leaf springs may prevent future issues, especially for vehicles used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per spring replacement (depending on the shop and spring quality)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can occur, especially if the vehicle is left sitting for extended periods. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component. A thorough diagnostic test is required to pinpoint the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Instrument Panel Cluster**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Instrument panel gauges (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.) can fail or provide inaccurate readings. The entire cluster may also flicker or go dark.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the instrument panel cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door (if equipped) can become difficult to open or close, often due to worn rollers, bent tracks, or a malfunctioning latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rollers, repairing or replacing the track, or adjusting or replacing the latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the severity and parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Driver/Passenger Seat Frame Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The metal frame of the driver or passenger seat can crack, especially in vehicles used for frequent or heavy use. This can lead to discomfort or instability.
    *   Solution: Welding the cracked frame or replacing the entire seat frame or seat assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on repair method and shop rates)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Chevrolet Express 4500, while a reliable workhorse, is not without its potential issues. The most significant problems seem to be related to transmission torque converter shudder, leaf spring issues, and electrical problems. These issues can lead to varying levels of inconvenience and repair costs, but are generally manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. The most expensive potential repair is replacing the transmission torque converter or leaf springs. Before purchasing, it's wise to check for signs of these problems and consider a thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic.
