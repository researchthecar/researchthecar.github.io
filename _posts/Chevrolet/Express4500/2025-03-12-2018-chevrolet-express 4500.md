The 2018 Chevrolet Express 4500 is a heavy-duty van primarily used for commercial purposes, such as cargo hauling, shuttle services, and conversion into recreational vehicles. The 2018 model year is available with several powertrain options. The most common engine is the 6.0L Vortec V8 engine which produces 341 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque. An alternate gasoline engine is the 4.3L V6 which produces 276 horsepower and 298 lb-ft of torque. Also, a 2.8L Duramax diesel engine is available which produces 181 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. These engines are typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Express 4500 for its robust build, high cargo capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design, which can make it easier to maintain. Downsides often cited include its dated interior, less-than-stellar fuel economy, and handling characteristics typical of a heavy-duty van.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system can cause lifter failure, leading to a collapsed lifter. This manifests as a ticking noise, misfires, and reduced engine power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected lifters is a common fix. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, sometimes attributed to piston ring issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing piston rings or the entire engine may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.3L V6**

*   No Issues Found

**2.8L Duramax Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system, including sensor failures, injector clogging, and pump malfunctions. This can trigger warning lights and reduce engine performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific component failure and replacing the faulty sensor, injector, or pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during gear shifts, particularly at lower speeds. This can be due to torque converter issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or flushing the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed gear changes. Could be related to valve body issues or worn clutch packs.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement, transmission rebuild, or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy-duty nature of the 4500, the rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially when consistently loaded near capacity. This can affect ride quality and handling. Cracking or breaking of the leaf springs is also possible.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with new or upgraded (higher capacity) units.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shocks and/or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensor failures can occur, including O2 sensors, mass airflow sensors, and wheel speed sensors. Symptoms vary depending on the sensor, but often include warning lights and performance issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days of sitting, indicating a parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Identifying and resolving the source of the parasitic draw (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessories).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially Around Wheel Wells and Lower Body Panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, panel replacement, and rustproofing treatments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found
