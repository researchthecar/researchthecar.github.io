The 2022 Chevrolet Tornado Van, also known as the Chevrolet Montana in some markets, is a compact pickup truck/van popular in Latin America and other regions. It's generally appreciated for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and utility as a small work vehicle. However, some common complaints revolve around its basic features, ride quality, and limited cargo capacity compared to larger trucks. The 2022 model is primarily equipped with a 1.2L inline-3 cylinder engine, producing around 109 horsepower and 85 lb-ft of torque. It is offered with a 5-speed manual transmission.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-3 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Engine Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report noticeable vibration, especially at idle and low speeds. This can be due to the inherent imbalance of a three-cylinder engine and potentially exacerbated by motor mount issues.
    *   Solution: Check and replace engine mounts. Investigate potential fuel injector issues or spark plug issues if vibrations persist.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the vibration)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hesitation During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers have noted a slight hesitation or lag when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This could be related to the engine's tuning or issues with the electronic throttle control.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates to the engine control unit (ECU). Inspect the throttle body for cleanliness and proper operation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on cause and if a software update resolves it)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Certain Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report difficulty shifting into 1st or 2nd gear, especially when cold. This can be caused by worn synchronizers or a misadjusted clutch cable.
    *   Solution: Adjust the clutch cable. If the issue persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (clutch cable adjustment), $800 - $2000+ (transmission repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage can occur under heavy acceleration, especially when the vehicle is loaded. This could be due to a worn clutch disc or a faulty pressure plate.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and potentially the throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Harsh Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners note that the ride quality is stiff and harsh, especially on rough roads. This is due to the van's basic suspension design, intended for carrying loads.
    *   Solution: Consider aftermarket shock absorbers or slightly softer tires to improve ride comfort.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced occasional freezing or crashing of the infotainment system, requiring a restart.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates. If the problem persists, the infotainment system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A few owners report issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Numerous rattles emanating from the dashboard, door panels, and cargo area, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattles and use foam padding or other materials to dampen the vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ (DIY fixes can be inexpensive, professional work will cost more)
    *   Recalls: None Found
