**Introduction:**

The 1995 Chevrolet Corsica is a mid-size sedan that was available with a range of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.2-liter four-cylinder that produced 115 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. Optional engines included a 3.1-liter V6 with 160 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4-liter V6 with 215 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a four-speed automatic, a five-speed manual, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

**Summary**

Overall, the 1995 Chevrolet Corsica is a relatively reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues to watch out for, especially with the 2.2-liter I4 engine. The most severe and costly issue is the timing chain failure on the 2.2-liter, which can lead to major engine damage. The transmission and electrical systems are generally reliable, but some issues can occur with the 4-speed automatic and the CVT. The suspension and exterior can also develop problems over time, but these are typically less severe and less expensive to fix.
