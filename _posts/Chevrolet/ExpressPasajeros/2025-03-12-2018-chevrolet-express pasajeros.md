The 2018 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros is a full-size passenger van known for its spaciousness, durability, and utility. Engine options for this model year include the 4.3L V6 (276 hp, 298 lb-ft of torque), the 6.0L V8 (341 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque), and the 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (181 hp, 369 lb-ft of torque). The 6.0L V8 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.8L and 4.3L engine options are available with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the van's cargo capacity and reliability. Downsides often cited include the van's gas mileage, outdated interior design, and basic features compared to newer competitors.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil between changes and visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic can perform a compression test and leak-down test to diagnose the cause. The fix could range from replacing valve seals to piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noises from the engine, misfires, and a check engine light can indicate AFM lifter failure. This is due to the AFM system deactivating cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, and error messages related to the DEF system. These issues can be caused by a faulty DEF injector, sensor, or pump.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component causing the issue and replace it. Clearing the DEF codes is also necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.0L V8)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky shifts between gears, especially when the transmission is cold. This can be caused by a faulty valve body or worn transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and replace the filter. If the issue persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.8L Duramax & 4.3L V6)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibrating sensation, particularly at low speeds and when the transmission is under light load.
    *   Solution: A revised transmission fluid may alleviate the shudder. In severe cases, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Affects ride quality and handling.
    * Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgraded springs for heavier loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a short period of time, preventing the vehicle from starting. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door locks malfunctioning, not locking, unlocking or sometimes locking and unlocking on their own.
    * Solution: Replace the door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult to open or close. Can be due to worn rollers, damaged tracks, or faulty latches.
    * Solution: Replace rollers and lubricate the track. Repair or replace latches.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air blowing from the vents. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a clogged expansion valve.
    *   Solution: Check for refrigerant leaks and recharge the system. If the compressor is faulty, it will need to be replaced. A clogged expansion valve will also require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the dashboard especially in hot climates
    * Solution: Replace or apply a dash cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros generally offers solid reliability, but owners should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly related to the AFM system in the 6.0L V8 and DEF issues in the 2.8L Duramax, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues such as harsh shifting and torque converter shudder are also prevalent. Electrical issues and sliding door malfunctions are other areas to consider. While many of these issues are not necessarily severe, the potential cost of repairs can be significant, making a thorough inspection and pre-purchase research essential.
