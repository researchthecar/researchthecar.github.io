The 2014 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros, a full-size passenger van, offers seating for up to 15 people and is known for its spacious interior, robust towing capacity, and utilitarian design. The 2014 model year provided several engine options: a 4.8L V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque). Each engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Express for its reliability and practicality, while others find its fuel economy and somewhat outdated design to be drawbacks.
