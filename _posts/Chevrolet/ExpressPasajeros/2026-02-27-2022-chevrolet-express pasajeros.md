### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros demonstrates a generally reliable mechanical foundation, particularly with its V6 engine option. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as coolant and oil leaks, which are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and type. The diesel engine variant, while powerful, can present more complex problems like fuel injector and EGR system issues, requiring more specialized and costly repairs. Transmission reliability is fair, with some reports of hesitation and overheating that may necessitate fluid services or internal repairs. Electrical components, especially the battery and alternator, can be sources of concern, as can interior elements like the HVAC blower motor and infotainment system. Proactive maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to ensuring the longevity and dependable operation of the Express Pasajeros.
