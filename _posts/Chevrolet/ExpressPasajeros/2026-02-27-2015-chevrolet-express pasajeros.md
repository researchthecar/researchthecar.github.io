### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, especially for its utilitarian purpose. The V6 and V8 engines are largely dependable, though specific issues like intake manifold leaks on the 4.3L and AFM problems on the 5.3L can arise. Transmissions, particularly the older 4-speed automatics, may require attention to the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, especially under heavy use. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. Interior comfort systems like HVAC can also present minor repair needs. Overall, the Express is a durable vehicle, but owners should be aware of these potential points of failure to ensure continued serviceability.
