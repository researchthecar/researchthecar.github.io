The 2013 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros is a full-size van known for its spaciousness, reliability, and utility. It offers three engine options: a 4.8L V8 (280 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (324 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque or 342 hp, 373 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (Hydra-Matic 6L80). Owners generally appreciate the Express for its cargo capacity and robust build, but common complaints include poor fuel economy, basic interior features, and sometimes, specific mechanical issues.
