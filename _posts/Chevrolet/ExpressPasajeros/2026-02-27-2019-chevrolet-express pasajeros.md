### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros demonstrates a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly for its intended commercial and passenger-hauling duties. However, potential buyers and owners should be aware of specific vulnerabilities. Engine options, especially the 4.3L V6 and 6.0L V8, can experience issues like intake manifold gasket leaks, oil cooler line leaks, and exhaust manifold leaks, which can lead to performance degradation and costly repairs if not addressed promptly. The 6-speed automatic transmission, while functional, can sometimes develop torque converter problems or fluid leaks. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also noted for potential wear. Electrical issues, particularly with the alternator, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are generally durable, the HVAC blower motor is a component that may require attention. Proactive maintenance and addressing these specific issues early can ensure the continued reliability of the Express Pasajeros.
