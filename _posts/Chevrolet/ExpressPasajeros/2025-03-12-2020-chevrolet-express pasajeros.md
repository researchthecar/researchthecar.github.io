The 2020 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros (Passenger) van is a full-size van known for its utilitarian nature, spacious interior, and robust capabilities. The standard engine is a 4.3L V6 producing 276 horsepower and 298 lb-ft of torque. Optional engines include a 6.0L V8 producing 341 horsepower and 373 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel producing 181 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 4.3L V6 is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and the 6.0L V8 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.8L Diesel is also paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the van's practicality and towing capacity, but some find its outdated design, fuel economy, and ride quality to be drawbacks.

**Engine**

**4.3L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from the oil pan gasket or valve cover gaskets. Symptoms include visible oil puddles under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and potential loss of power. This issue is linked to the AFM system which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can cause premature lifter wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters is a temporary fix, but disabling AFM entirely is a more permanent solution. This can be achieved through aftermarket tuning or installing an AFM disabler device.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, DEF level warning even when the tank is full. Problems can arise from a faulty DEF level sensor, DEF injector, or DEF pump. Crystalline buildup within the DEF system is also a frequent issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific component failure is needed. Replacing the DEF level sensor, injector, or pump are common repairs. Cleaning or replacing the DEF injector may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.0L V8 and 2.8L Diesel)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifts between gears, especially when cold. Slipping out of gear or failing to engage a gear are other symptoms.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the issue persists, a more in-depth diagnosis is needed. Valve body issues are fairly common with this transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for fluid change; $800 - $2,000+ for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 4.3L V6)**
*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the van sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded. Cracking or broken leaf springs can be visually inspected. Reduced ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the van is frequently used for hauling heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery after sitting for a short period of time. Difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws by testing the current draw with the vehicle off. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories (especially those improperly installed), a faulty body control module (BCM), or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks not working properly, intermittently working, or making a buzzing sound when activated.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, sticking, or requiring excessive force to operate. Issues can stem from worn rollers, damaged tracks, or a misaligned door.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rollers, tracks, and alignment of the door. Lubricate the rollers and tracks. Replace worn rollers or repair damaged tracks. Adjust the door alignment as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the severity and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: No air blowing from the vents, weak airflow, or unusual noises coming from the blower motor.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor. This is a relatively simple repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros, while generally reliable for its intended purpose, does exhibit some common issues. The most concerning are the AFM lifter issues on the 6.0L V8, which can be a costly repair. Other issues, such as oil leaks, DEF system problems on the diesel, sliding door issues, and blower motor failures, are more common and can range in severity and cost to repair. Pre-purchase inspection of the vehicle is recommended, focusing on engine noises, transmission performance, and the functionality of all electrical components.
