### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its powertrain options. The V6 and V8 engines, while robust, can experience issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and, in the case of the 5.3L V8, potential problems with the Active Fuel Management system. The automatic transmissions are mostly dependable, though torque converter and fluid leak issues can arise. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to the van's load-carrying nature. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are not uncommon. Overall, the Express Pasajeros is a practical choice for passenger transport, with most potential issues being addressable and not indicative of systemic design flaws, but rather typical for a heavy-duty vehicle of its age and purpose.
