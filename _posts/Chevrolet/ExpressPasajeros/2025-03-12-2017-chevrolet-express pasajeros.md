**Summary:**

The 2017 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros, while a practical and spacious vehicle, does have some common issues to be aware of. The engine problems, particularly with the 5.3L V8's AFM system and oil consumption, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems such as torque converter shudder and harsh shifting are also common, though sometimes addressable with fluid changes. Other issues such as leaf spring sagging, electrical problems, and interior issues are also less severe but can be annoying and costly to fix. Potential buyers should have the van inspected by a qualified mechanic prior to purchase to identify any existing or potential problems and take these issues into consideration when negotiating the price.
