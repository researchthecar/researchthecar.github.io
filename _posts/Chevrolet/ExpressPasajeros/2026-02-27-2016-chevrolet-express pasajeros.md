### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Chevrolet Express Pasajeros demonstrates a mixed reliability profile. The V6 and V8 engines, particularly the 5.3L with its AFM system, are prone to specific issues like cooling system leaks and oil consumption. Transmission reliability is generally good, though older 4-speed automatics can experience torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to the van's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are not uncommon. Interior and exterior components are generally robust, with only minor issues like HVAC blower motor resistors being frequently reported. Overall, while not immune to problems, many issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
