The 2015 Chevrolet Traverse is a popular full-size crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and ample cargo capacity. It's a family-friendly vehicle that many appreciate for its seating for up to eight passengers and relatively smooth highway driving. However, some common complaints revolve around its large size making it less maneuverable in tight spaces, and certain model years are associated with specific mechanical issues that can be costly to repair. The 2015 Traverse came standard with a 3.6L V6 engine producing 281 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque (or 288 hp and 270 lb-ft in the LTZ trim due to dual exhaust), paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue involves premature wear or failure of the timing chains. Symptoms include a rattling noise, especially upon starting the engine, and the check engine light illuminating with codes related to timing discrepancies (e.g., P0008, P0016, P0017). This can lead to poor engine performance, reduced fuel economy, and eventually engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chains, guides, tensioners, and potentially the camshaft gears.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Experiencing hard starts, extended cranking, reduced power, or stalling. A check engine light may illuminate with codes related to fuel pressure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty ignition coils**
    * Description/Symptoms: Experiencing hard starts, extended cranking, reduced power, or stalling. A check engine light may illuminate with codes related to misfires on specific cylinders.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil/coils.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per coil
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70/6T75)**

*   **Wave Plate Failure (3-5-R Clutch)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a well-documented problem with the 6T70/6T75 transmission. The wave plate in the 3-5-R clutch pack is prone to cracking and eventually breaking. Symptoms include harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears (especially 3rd and 5th), and eventually, a complete loss of certain gears.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement with an updated wave plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Issues**
  * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially under light acceleration. Can feel like the transmission is slipping.
  * Solution: Torque converter replacement or transmission rebuild.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, uneven tire wear, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Airbag Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminating on the dashboard. Diagnostic codes indicating a malfunctioning airbag sensor, often related to the front impact sensors or side impact sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty airbag sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: **Recall # 16V643000** On certain model year 2015 Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, and Buick Enclave vehicles, the second row seats may not properly latch. During a crash, the seat may move out of position, increasing the risk of injury.

* **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
  * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent screen blackouts, unresponsive touch screen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, or complete system failure.
  * Solution: Software updates or replacement of the radio/infotainment system unit.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may stop functioning, either failing to open or close, or becoming stuck in one position. This can be caused by a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty component (motor, struts, latch).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises behind the dashboard, inconsistent temperature control (e.g., blowing cold air on one side and hot air on the other), or inability to direct airflow to specific vents.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty HVAC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on location of actuator)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Traverse, while generally a reliable and comfortable family SUV, does suffer from several notable issues. The most significant and potentially expensive problems revolve around the engine's timing chain and the transmission's wave plate failure, with repair costs easily exceeding several thousand dollars. Other issues like suspension components and electrical problems, while less costly, can still be inconvenient and add to the overall cost of ownership. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any used 2015 Traverse before purchasing, paying particular attention to any unusual noises from the engine or transmission.
