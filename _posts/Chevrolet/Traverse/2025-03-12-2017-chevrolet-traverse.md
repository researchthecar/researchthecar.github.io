The 2017 Chevrolet Traverse is a popular family-friendly SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and ample cargo capacity. While it offers a lot of positives, like its smooth ride and relatively good fuel economy for its size, some owners have reported certain issues. Common complaints include problems with the transmission shifting, excessive oil consumption, and electrical system glitches. The 2017 Traverse comes standard with a 3.6L V6 engine producing around 281-288 horsepower and 266-270 lb-ft of torque, depending on the trim. It is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 3.6L V6 engine consuming an excessive amount of oil between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil, low oil pressure warnings, and blue smoke from the exhaust. This can sometimes be attributed to faulty valve seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source of the oil consumption. Depending on the cause, the repair may involve replacing valve seals, piston rings, or the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L V6 is known for timing chain issues. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners. It's often recommended to replace the water pump at the same time, as it's driven by the timing chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or erratic shifting, especially between certain gears. Hesitation during acceleration can also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue if it's due to contaminated or degraded fluid. In some cases, a software update or valve body replacement may be necessary. If the issue persists, a full transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear or failure of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced a parasitic battery drain, causing the battery to die overnight or after a few days of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the drain by performing a parasitic draw test. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty modules, or a malfunctioning alternator. Repair involves fixing or replacing the offending component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions of the infotainment system, including freezing, rebooting, and failure to respond to touch inputs.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the air conditioning system, such as weak airflow, inconsistent cooling, or failure to blow cold air.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the malfunction, which may involve checking the refrigerant level, compressor, condenser, or evaporator. Repair involves recharging the system, replacing faulty components, or repairing leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (recharge) - $1500+ (compressor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Traverse has some notable issues, particularly concerning the engine, transmission, and electrical systems.
