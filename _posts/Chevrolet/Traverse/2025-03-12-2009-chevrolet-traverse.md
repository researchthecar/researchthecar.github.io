The 2009 Chevrolet Traverse was a full-size crossover SUV that offered seating for up to eight passengers, making it a popular choice for families. It was offered with a 3.6L High Feature V6 engine that produced around 281 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. The 2009 Traverse came standard with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Traverse for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and decent fuel economy for its size. However, common complaints included issues with the timing chain, excessive oil consumption, and problems with the electrical system.

**Engine**

**3.6L High Feature V6 (LLT)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or break, leading to rough running, misfires, check engine light illumination (often with codes P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018), and in severe cases, engine damage. This issue is often linked to oil degradation and inadequate maintenance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, sprockets, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormal amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage if not monitored. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause (worn piston rings, valve seals, etc.), the repair can range from replacing valve seals to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (highly variable depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The high-pressure fuel pump may fail causing the engine to stall or run poorly.
    * Solution: Replace the HPFP
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6T70 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Wave Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3-5-R wave plate within the transmission can fracture, leading to loss of 3rd and 5th gears, as well as reverse.
    *   Solution: Replacing the wave plate and potentially other damaged internal transmission components.  A complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Torque converter clutch failure can cause shuddering at highway speeds and the engine to stall.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and leaking of the front struts and rear shocks, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, even when the vehicle is not in use, making it difficult to start.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the parasitic draw causing the battery drain (could be a faulty module, light, or other electrical component).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (per door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor resistor fails, causing the HVAC blower motor to only work on certain settings or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear liftgate struts lose pressure, causing the liftgate to not stay open or to close unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Illumination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the airbag light (faulty sensor, wiring issue, etc.) and repairing or replacing the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet Traverse is prone to some potentially expensive issues, particularly concerning the engine and transmission. Timing chain issues and excessive oil consumption are prevalent problems with the 3.6L V6 engine. Wave plate failure in the 6T70 transmission is another significant concern. Electrical problems such as battery drain and door lock actuator failure are also common. The severity of these issues can range from relatively minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect any 2009 Traverse before purchase, paying close attention to engine sounds, oil levels, and transmission performance.
