The 2010 Chevrolet Traverse is a full-size crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and decent fuel economy for its class. It was available with a single engine option: a 3.6L V6 engine, which produced around 281 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. The engine was mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Traverse's family-friendly features and ample cargo space, but some common complaints include issues with the timing chain, transmission problems, and electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

* **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The most common issue reported is premature timing chain wear, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potentially complete engine failure. Symptoms include a check engine light with codes related to timing chain issues (e.g., P0008, P0016, P0017), rattling noise from the engine, and decreased performance.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners. In severe cases, engine damage may require a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failure of the high pressure fuel pump may cause engine issues, such as rough running, misfires, poor acceleration, or stalling. A check engine light may come on.
    * Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70)**

* **Wave Plate Failure (3-5-R)**
    * Description/Symptoms: A common failure point in the 6T70 transmission is the 3-5-Reverse wave plate. Symptoms include harsh or delayed shifting, slipping in 3rd or 5th gear, and eventual loss of those gears.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. The wave plate needs to be replaced with a stronger, updated version.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can result in shuddering during gear shifts, poor fuel economy, and transmission slipping.
    * Solution: Torque converter replacement. Often, it's recommended to flush the transmission cooler lines to prevent debris from damaging the new torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Struts and Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks wear out prematurely leading to a bouncy ride and poor handling.
    * Solution: Replacing the struts and shocks.

**Summary**

The 2010 Chevrolet Traverse, while praised for its spaciousness and family-friendly design, faces some significant reliability concerns. The most prevalent issues relate to the 3.6L V6 engine, specifically timing chain wear, and the 6T70 transmission, with wave plate failures being common. Electrical issues and interior problems further contribute to the overall ownership experience. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's maintenance history before purchasing. The severity and cost of repairs can be substantial, making it crucial to budget accordingly.
