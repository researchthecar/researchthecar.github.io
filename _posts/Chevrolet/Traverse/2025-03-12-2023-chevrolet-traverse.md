**Engine**

**3.6L V6 LFY**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The fix is typically replacing the PCV valve. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $25 - $50+ for PCV valve, $2,000 - $5,000+ for piston ring or engine replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the timing chain can occur, leading to engine knocking, rough idling, and potential engine failure if left unaddressed. This issue is often signaled by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (GM 9T65)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or "jolt" during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Some cases require a transmission valve body replacement. In other cases, a software reflash or complete transmission replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ for valve body replacement, $3,000 - $6,000+ for transmission replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may hesitate or delay when shifting into drive or reverse. This can be particularly noticeable when starting from a stop.
    *   Solution: This could be due to low transmission fluid, a faulty transmission control module (TCM), or internal transmission damage. Diagnosis is required to determine the specific cause. A TCM flash update may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for fluid change, $300 - $1,000+ for TCM replacement or flash. More for full transmission work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their struts and shocks wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. This can also result in unusual tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, become unresponsive, or crash entirely, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve the issue. In some cases, the infotainment module needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates, $500 - $1,500+ for module replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced a dead battery, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from an electrical component that isn't shutting off properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic drain. This could involve replacing a faulty module, switch, or sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
