## 2015 Chevrolet Traverse

The 2015 Chevrolet Traverse is a midsize SUV that offers plenty of space for passengers and cargo. It's available with a choice of two engines: a 3.6-liter V6 that produces 281 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 259 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Traverse has a comfortable interior with plenty of features, including a standard 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, satellite radio, and Bluetooth connectivity. It also has a spacious cargo area that can be expanded by folding down the second- and third-row seats.

However, the Traverse has some drawbacks. It's not as fuel-efficient as some of its rivals, and its handling can be a bit ponderous. Additionally, some owners have reported problems with the vehicle's engine, transmission, and electrical system.
