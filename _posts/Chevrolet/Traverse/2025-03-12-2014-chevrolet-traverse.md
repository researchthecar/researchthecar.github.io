The 2014 Chevrolet Traverse is a popular full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and ample cargo capacity. It was offered with one engine option: a 3.6L V6 engine producing 281 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque in the LS and LT trims, and 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque in the LTZ trim. It was available with a single transmission option, the Hydra-Matic 6T75 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Traverse for its family-friendly features and smooth handling. However, common complaints include issues with the timing chain, air conditioning system, and some electrical components.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6 (LLT/LFX)**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit a rattling noise, especially during cold starts. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to timing chain issues (e.g., P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018). Can lead to reduced engine performance and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially the camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, long cranking times, stalling, fuel efficiency decreases.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPFP and test the fuel lines for leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $750 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Evaporative Emissions (EVAP) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check Engine Light illuminated with EVAP related codes (e.g., P0442, P0455). Can be caused by a faulty gas cap, purge valve, vent valve, or leaks in the EVAP system hoses or canister.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the EVAP leak and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Hydra-Matic 6T75 6-Speed Automatic**

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Traverse is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of the potential for timing chain issues, air conditioning problems, and transmission-related concerns. The cost of these repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. While not all Traverses will experience these issues, it's prudent to have a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used model, paying particular attention to engine noises and transmission performance.
