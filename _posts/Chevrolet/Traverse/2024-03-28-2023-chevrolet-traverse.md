**Introduction**

The 2023 Chevrolet Traverse is a three-row SUV that offers a spacious interior, comfortable ride, and a variety of engine and transmission options. It is available with a 3.6-liter V6 engine that produces 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 252 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission, and the V6 engine can also be paired with a ten-speed automatic transmission.
