### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Chevrolet Traverse generally offers good reliability, particularly in its suspension, exterior, and interior components, where no widespread issues are reported. The primary areas of concern revolve around the powertrain, specifically the 3.6L V6 engine experiencing occasional oil and coolant leaks, and the 9-speed automatic transmission showing tendencies for hesitation and shuddering, sometimes requiring software updates or internal repairs. The 2.0L Turbo engine has seen some reports of turbocharger issues. Electrical system glitches, such as infotainment screen unresponsiveness and battery drain, are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and consider a pre-purchase inspection, especially for higher-mileage vehicles.
