### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Chevrolet Traverse presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.6L V6 engine, while generally robust, can experience oil and coolant leaks. The 2.0L turbo option is less common but has reported turbocharger issues. The 9-speed automatic transmission is a notable area of concern, with reports of hesitation, shuddering, and overheating, often requiring software updates or internal repairs. Suspension components like strut mounts can develop noise. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also present. Interior components like the blower motor and power seat actuators can fail. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs, especially concerning the transmission.
