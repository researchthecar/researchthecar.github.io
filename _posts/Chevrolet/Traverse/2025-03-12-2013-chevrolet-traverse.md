The 2013 Chevrolet Traverse is a large, three-row crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and ample cargo capacity. It came standard with a 3.6L V6 engine, producing 281 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque in most trims, and 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque in the LTZ trim. This engine was exclusively paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Traverse for its family-friendly features and smooth highway driving. Common dislikes include its size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, check engine light illuminated with codes related to timing chain issues (e.g., P0008, P0016, P0017), rough idle, decreased performance, and potentially engine damage if not addressed. This issue often arises due to oil degradation and infrequent oil changes leading to inadequate lubrication of the timing chain components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially other related components. It is also recommended to flush the engine and address any underlying oil consumption issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult to start, long crank times, engine stalls, rough running engine, and a check engine light may illuminate with codes related to the fuel pump or fuel pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, coolant smell, and potential engine damage if not addressed quickly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump and potentially the thermostat and coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70/6T75)**

*   **Wave Plate Failure (Specifically in the 3-5-R Wave Plate)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, particularly between 3rd and 5th gear, or reverse, transmission failure. Debris from the broken wave plate can contaminate the transmission fluid and damage other components.
    *   Solution: Complete transmission rebuild or replacement, including replacing the wave plate with an updated, reinforced version. Fluid flush and inspection of other components for damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter and potentially a transmission flush and filter change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the struts and/or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise that increases with speed, vibration in the steering wheel, and potential play in the wheel when lifted.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, and the need for frequent jump-starts. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve replacing a faulty module (e.g., Body Control Module (BCM), radio, etc.) or fixing wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,000+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to operate or operating intermittently. Often caused by a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window motor and/or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Liftgate failing to open or close properly, requiring excessive force to operate, or making unusual noises. This is more common with power liftgates.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the liftgate motor, struts, or latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no air conditioning, unusual noises from the AC system, and temperature inconsistencies.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the AC system, which may involve replacing the compressor, condenser, evaporator, or expansion valve. Refrigerant recharge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1200+ (depending on the component needing repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is the most common repair, but can be very expensive. Some owners opt for dashboard covers as a more affordable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Chevrolet Traverse, while appreciated for its spaciousness and comfort, has several notable issues. Engine problems, particularly timing chain wear, can be costly. Transmission issues, specifically wave plate failure, are also prevalent and similarly expensive to repair. Electrical problems can range from minor to significant, and interior and exterior issues can affect overall satisfaction. The severity of these issues varies, but the potential cost of repairs can be substantial, making a thorough inspection and maintenance history review essential for potential buyers.
