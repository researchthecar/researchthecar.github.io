**Introduction:** The 2016 Chevrolet Traverse is a three-row SUV that offers a spacious cabin and a powerful V6 engine. It is available with a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The Traverse is popular for its comfort, versatility, and towing capacity. However, it has also been reported to have several issues.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Oil or coolant leaks from the intake manifold gasket, causing a drop in engine performance and potential engine damage. The gasket needs to be replaced, which costs $500 - $1,000+. Recall: NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V180000
* **Timing Chain Failure:** The timing chain may stretch or break, leading to engine damage. The entire timing chain system needs to be replaced, costing $3,000 - $5,000+. Recall: NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V180000

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting:** The transmission may shift gears abruptly or hesitate, causing discomfort or potential damage to the transmission. The transmission fluid flush and replacement may help, costing $150 - $300+. Recall: NHTSA Campaign Number: 17V853000

**Suspension**

* **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure:** The bushing in the front lower control arm may wear out prematurely, causing noise, vibration, and reduced stability. The control arm needs to be replaced, costing $500 - $800+.
* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure:** The rear shock absorbers may fail, resulting in a rough ride, reduced handling, and potential damage to other suspension components. The shock absorbers need to be replaced, costing $300 - $500+ per side.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery may drain prematurely, causing difficulty starting or electrical failures. The issue can often be traced to the alternator or parasitical drain from an electrical component. The fix could range from a simple battery replacement to extensive electrical diagnostics and repairs, costing $100 - $1,000+.
* **Power Window Failure:** The power window motors or switches may fail, preventing the windows from opening or closing. The involved window assemblies need to be repaired or replaced, costing $200 - $500+ per window.

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Seal Failure:** The sunroof seal may tear or leak, allowing water and air leaks into the cabin. The sunroof seal needs to be replaced, costing $200 - $500+.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Squeaks and Rattles:** The dashboard materials may squeak or rattle over bumps or during temperature changes. The source of the noise can vary, requiring interior panel removal and adjustments, costing $50 - $200+ to fix.
* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure:** The HVAC blower motor may fail, resulting in a lack of air circulation in the cabin. The blower motor and/or associated components need to be replaced, costing $200 - $400+.

**Summary:** The 2016 Chevrolet Traverse has some reported issues that can be costly to repair. The engine, transmission, and suspension components are the most commonly affected, with potential costs ranging from $500 to over $5,000. While some of these issues are less severe or can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, others can significantly impact vehicle performance and safety.
