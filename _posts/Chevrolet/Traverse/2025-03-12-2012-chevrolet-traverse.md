The 2012 Chevrolet Traverse is a full-size crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and ample cargo capacity. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.6L V6 engine, producing approximately 281-288 horsepower and 266-270 lb-ft of torque, depending on the trim level. All trims came equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Traverse's ability to carry up to eight passengers and its relatively smooth highway ride. Common dislikes include the vehicle's size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces, and reported reliability issues, particularly with the timing chain and transmission.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6 LLT/LFX**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is arguably the most common and significant issue. Symptoms include a check engine light (often with codes P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018), rough idling, decreased engine performance, and a rattling noise coming from the engine, especially upon startup. The timing chain stretches due to poor oil maintenance and/or a faulty chain design.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially the variable valve timing (VVT) actuators. It's crucial to use updated parts to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This pump supplies high pressure fuel to the fuel injectors. When it goes bad, the vehicle can exhibit symptoms such as long cranks, misfires, hesitation under acceleration, and/or a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks (often near the front of the engine), and a whining noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump and thermostat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6T70/6T75 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Wave Plate Failure (3-5-R Clutch)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, and eventually complete loss of 3rd, 5th, and reverse gears. This is a common failure point in these transmissions.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement, specifically addressing the wave plate issue and potentially replacing other worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during light acceleration or when the torque converter locks up. The transmission may also overheat.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter and flushing the transmission cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, slipping, or failure to shift into certain gears. The valve body controls the flow of transmission fluid and can become clogged or malfunction.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild. In some cases, cleaning the valve body and replacing solenoids may be sufficient.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower in the rear, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. Can cause a rougher ride and affect handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of rear shocks and/or springs.  Some owners upgrade to heavier-duty springs or air suspension to address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Humming or grinding noise that increases with speed.  Wobbling or play in the wheel.
    *   Solution: Wheel bearing replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, especially after short periods of inactivity. Can be caused by parasitic drain from faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the parasitic drain. This may involve replacing faulty modules, disconnecting aftermarket accessories, or replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power liftgate fails to open or close properly, makes unusual noises, or gets stuck.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate motor, struts, or latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues (Rear AC)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear AC blows warm air, while front AC works fine. Often caused by a faulty rear AC actuator or refrigerant leak in the rear system.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the rear AC actuator, or leak repair and refrigerant recharge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2012 Chevrolet Traverse is prone to several issues, with the most serious and expensive being timing chain failure and transmission problems. These can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical issues and suspension problems are also common complaints. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history, listen for engine noises, and check for transmission slipping before purchasing. The severity of these issues ranges from inconvenient (battery drain) to potentially catastrophic (engine or transmission failure), so thorough due diligence is essential.
