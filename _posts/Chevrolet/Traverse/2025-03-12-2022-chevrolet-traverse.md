The 2022 Chevrolet Traverse is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and ample cargo space. It's powered by a 3.6L V6 engine, producing 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciate its practicality and family-friendly features, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system, and occasional transmission quirks. Many owners enjoy the cargo capacity and the relatively smooth ride quality. Some criticisms include its bland styling and merely adequate fuel economy for its class.
