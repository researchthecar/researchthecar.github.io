The 2007 Chevrolet T7500 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications. It offered a range of engine and transmission options. The most common engine was the Duramax 6.6L diesel, producing around 300 horsepower and 520 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options may have included larger displacement diesel engines with varying power outputs depending on the specific configuration. Common transmission options included Allison automatic transmissions, known for their durability. Owners often praise the T7500 for its workhorse capabilities and robust chassis, but dislike its relatively basic interior and potential for higher maintenance costs associated with commercial vehicles.

**Engine**

**Duramax 6.6L Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, rough idle, black smoke from exhaust, decreased fuel economy. Can lead to engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. Recalibrate the ECM (Engine Control Module) after installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector, depending on the shop and injector type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Lack of power, excessive black smoke, whistling or screeching noises from the engine bay, and potential for the engine to go into "limp mode."
    *   Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger for boost leaks, damaged vanes, or bearing failure. Replacement or rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ for replacement, depending on turbocharger model and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling, check engine light illuminated. Reduced engine performance due to improper exhaust gas recirculation.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700, depending on the shop and if cleaning is possible.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on number of solenoids replaced and diagnostic time.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, poor handling, increased body roll, and potential for spring failure.
    *   Solution: Replace worn or damaged leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring replaced, depending on the shop and brand of leaf spring.
    *   Recalls: None Found
