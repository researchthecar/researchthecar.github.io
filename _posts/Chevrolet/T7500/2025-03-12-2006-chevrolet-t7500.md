Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2006 Chevrolet T7500, categorized by major components and, where applicable, engine/transmission options. The 2006 Chevrolet T7500 is a medium-duty commercial truck often used for various applications like hauling, towing, and service work. Engine options included the Duramax diesel engines, most commonly the 6.6L LBZ. These engines typically produced around 300-330 horsepower and 600-650 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions were typically Allison automatics, known for their durability in commercial applications. Owners often praised the T7500 for its robust build and workhorse capabilities, but some common complaints revolved around maintenance costs, parts availability, and ride comfort due to its heavy-duty nature.
