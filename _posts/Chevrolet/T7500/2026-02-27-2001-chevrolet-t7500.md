### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet T7500, as a commercial vehicle, generally exhibits robust mechanicals, particularly its V8 gasoline engines and heavy-duty transmissions. Common issues tend to revolve around wear items that are exacerbated by heavy use, such as intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines on the Vortec engines, and specific components like the 5th gear in the NV4500 manual transmission. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can experience issues due to load. Electrical system reliability is generally good, though older vehicles may face wiring harness corrosion. Exterior rust is a significant concern for vehicles operating in harsh climates. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and gauge clusters are also potential failure points. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the T7500 can remain a reliable workhorse.
