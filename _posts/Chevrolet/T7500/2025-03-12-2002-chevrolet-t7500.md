**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet T7500, while a durable workhorse, can suffer from issues typical of medium-duty trucks of that era. The Caterpillar 3126 engine can experience injector and HEUI pump failures, potentially leading to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, especially with the Allison automatics, can also be expensive to address. Suspension and electrical issues are common and can contribute to overall maintenance costs. Corrosion is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. While many of these issues are age-related, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for costly repairs and factor that into their purchasing decision.
