The 2008 Chevrolet T7500 is a medium-duty commercial truck, often used for applications like delivery, service, and utility work. Engine options included the Duramax diesel engines, specifically the 6.6L LBZ and LMM variants. These engines produce around 300-330 horsepower and 605-660 lb-ft of torque, depending on the exact configuration. Transmission options typically included Allison automatic transmissions. Owners generally appreciate the T7500 for its robust build, reliability, and workhorse capabilities. Downsides often cited include fuel economy and the higher maintenance costs associated with commercial vehicles.

**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax LBZ/LMM Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, excessive smoke, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine misfires. Often, the injectors become clogged or fail electrically.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine overheating. The EGR cooler can crack, allowing coolant to enter the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, whining noise from the turbocharger, and potential engine damage. Bearings within the turbocharger can fail, leading to compressor wheel damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison Automatic (Specific Model Varies by Configuration)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slippage between gears, and potential transmission overheating. The torque converter can fail internally due to worn clutches or damaged bearings.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, and transmission error codes. Solenoids control the flow of fluid within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, clunking noises from the suspension, and compromised ride quality. Leaf springs can crack or lose their arch over time, especially under heavy loads.
    *   Solution: Replace the damaged leaf spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per spring, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Steering play, clunking noises from the front suspension, and uneven tire wear. Ball joints are critical for steering and suspension movement.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or damaged ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, including lighting malfunctions, sensor failures, and starting issues. Wiring harnesses can become damaged due to chafing, corrosion, or heat exposure.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the damaged wiring harness sections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, slow engine cranking, and a dead battery. The alternator is responsible for charging the battery and powering electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around the wheel wells, door panels, and other body panels. This is especially common in areas with road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust and refinish the body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per panel depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor stops working, resulting in no air flow from the vents. The blower motor resistor or the blower motor itself can fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor or the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500 including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Chevrolet T7500 can be a dependable work truck, but it is prone to certain common issues, particularly concerning the Duramax diesel engine and the Allison transmission. Fuel injector and EGR cooler failures are common, and turbocharger issues can arise. Suspension issues are related to ball joint issues and suspension issues. Electrical issues are likely due to wiring harness issues. Rust forming on the exterior is also a common concern. These issues, while potentially costly, are generally manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. The severity and cost of these repairs vary greatly based on the specific issue and the extent of the damage.
