Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2009 Chevrolet T7500, formatted for your website and focusing on accurate information.

The 2009 Chevrolet T7500 is a medium-duty commercial truck designed for various applications like delivery, utility work, and construction. It came with various engine and transmission options. The most common engine was the Duramax 6.6L diesel engine, producing around 330 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. Common transmission options included the Allison 1000 series automatic. Owners generally appreciate the truck's durability and workhorse capabilities. Some common complaints revolve around fuel economy, the cost of maintenance on commercial vehicles, and specific issues with certain components as detailed below.

**Engine**

**Duramax 6.6L Diesel (LMM)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, excessive smoke (white or black), decreased fuel economy, and potential engine misfires. Often caused by contaminated fuel or normal wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the failing injector(s). Replacement of the faulty injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per injector (depending on location and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential overheating. Internal leaks within the EGR cooler allow coolant to enter the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler. Inspect the EGR valve for damage and replace if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues (Specifically variable geometry turbocharger - VGT)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Lack of power, black smoke from the exhaust, turbocharger whine, and potential for the "check engine" light to illuminate. VGT issues can be caused by carbon buildup preventing proper vane movement.
    *   Solution: Diagnose with a scan tool, checking for boost pressure and VGT functionality. Cleaning or replacing the turbocharger, including the VGT actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $3000+ (depending on whether cleaning or replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 Series Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during torque converter lockup, decreased fuel economy, and potential for overheating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm TCC failure. Replacement of the torque converter. Flush the transmission cooler lines and cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, slipping between gears, and potential for the transmission to get stuck in a specific gear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the failing solenoid(s). Replacement of the faulty solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on labor and the number of solenoids needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, poor ride quality, and potential for bottoming out. Common in vehicles that are frequently overloaded or used in heavy-duty applications.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is consistently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle (depending on spring type and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, including lighting malfunctions, sensor failures, and starting issues. Corrosion and chafing of wiring harnesses are common, especially in areas exposed to the elements.
    *   Solution: Thorough inspection of the wiring harnesses, focusing on connectors and areas prone to rubbing. Repair or replacement of damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Cab Mount Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust and corrosion on the cab mounts, especially in areas where salt and road debris accumulate. Can lead to structural weakness and noise.
    *   Solution: Inspection and cleaning of the cab mounts. Application of rust inhibitor and protective coating. Replacement of severely corroded mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per mount (depending on the severity and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents. Can be caused by a faulty blower motor, resistor, or wiring.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the failing component. Replacement of the blower motor, resistor, or repair of the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet T7500 is a capable medium-duty truck but, like any vehicle, has its share of potential issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly related to the Duramax diesel and Allison transmission, can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical issues are also common. While individual repairs might not be overwhelmingly expensive, the cumulative effect of these potential issues can significantly impact the total cost of ownership. Buyers should thoroughly inspect these trucks and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic specializing in commercial vehicles.
