### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet T7500 demonstrates good overall reliability for its class, with the Duramax and Vortec engines being generally dependable, though specific issues like EGR coolers and intake manifold gaskets can arise. The Allison transmission is a strong point, but torque converter and solenoid issues can occur with high mileage or heavy use. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, may require attention due to the truck's load-carrying capacity. Electrical systems are susceptible to common issues like alternator failure and wiring corrosion. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates. Interior issues are typically minor, such as HVAC blower motor failures. Regular maintenance and addressing potential problems proactively are key to ensuring long-term serviceability.
