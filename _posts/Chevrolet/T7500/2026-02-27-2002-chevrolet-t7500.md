### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet T7500 generally exhibits good reliability for its class, particularly in its powertrain and chassis components, provided it has been maintained adequately. Common issues tend to arise from high mileage and the demanding nature of commercial use, such as cooling system leaks in gasoline engines and injector or EGR issues in diesel variants. Transmission reliability is generally strong with the Allison options, though torque converter and solenoid issues can occur. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can experience wear and breakage under heavy loads. Electrical system issues like alternator failure and wiring corrosion are also noted. Interior wear is typical for a work vehicle. Overall, the T7500 is a capable truck, but owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to its heavy-duty application.
