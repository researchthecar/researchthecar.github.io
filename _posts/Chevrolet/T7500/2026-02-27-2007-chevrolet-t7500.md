### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chevrolet T7500 demonstrates solid reliability, particularly in its core powertrain components, which are designed for demanding commercial use. The Duramax and Vortec engines, while robust, can experience issues like glow plug problems or EGR cooler leaks in the diesel and intake manifold gasket leaks in the gasoline variant, respectively. Transmission issues, primarily with the Allison automatics, often revolve around the torque converter or solenoid packs. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can be subject to wear and potential breakage under heavy loads. Electrical system concerns like alternator failure and wiring corrosion are also noted. Overall, the T7500 is a dependable workhorse, but proactive maintenance and awareness of these potential issues are crucial for long-term operational efficiency.
