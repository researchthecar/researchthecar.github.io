The 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV is an all-electric hatchback known for its affordability, long range, and nimble handling. It's powered by a single electric motor driving the front wheels. The electric motor produces 200 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. There are no other engine options as it is a fully electric vehicle. People generally like the Bolt EV's spacious interior, quick acceleration, and available one-pedal driving. Common dislikes include the lack of all-wheel drive and some lower-quality interior materials.
