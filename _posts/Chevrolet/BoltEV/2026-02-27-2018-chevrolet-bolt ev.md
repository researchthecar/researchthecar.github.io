### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV generally exhibits good reliability, as expected from an electric vehicle with fewer moving parts. The primary concerns revolve around the longevity and performance of the high-voltage battery pack, with some instances of degradation and the potential need for replacement outside of warranty. The 12V auxiliary battery is a common failure point across many vehicle types, including the Bolt. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and charging port, are also noted. However, the core electric drivetrain and suspension components appear robust. Owners should be aware of battery health and potential software-related issues.
