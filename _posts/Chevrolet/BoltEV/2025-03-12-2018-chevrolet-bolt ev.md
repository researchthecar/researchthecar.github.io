The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV is an all-electric subcompact hatchback known for its impressive range and practicality. It comes with a single electric motor option paired with a direct drive transmission. The motor produces 200 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Bolt EV for its nimble handling, quick acceleration, and ample cargo space for its size. Common criticisms include the somewhat basic interior materials and the initial range limitations (which were later addressed with software updates and battery replacements under recall).

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**
* **Battery Cell Manufacturing Defect (LG Chem)**
    * Description/Symptoms: This is the most significant issue for the 2018 Bolt EV. Due to manufacturing defects in the LG Chem battery cells, the battery pack can pose a fire risk. Symptoms may include burning smells, smoke, or fire emanating from the battery pack, but often there are no noticeable symptoms before a fire. The issue stems from a torn anode tab and folded separator in the battery cells.
    * Solution: The initial solution was a software update (N2023140) that limited the battery charge to 80% and implemented advanced diagnostic monitoring. However, the ultimate fix is a complete battery pack replacement with a new battery pack that does not have the defect.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under recall (N2123230)
    * Recalls: N2023140, N2123230

* **Reduced Propulsion Power Message**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a "Reduced Propulsion Power" message displayed on the dashboard, leading to a significant decrease in the vehicle's acceleration and top speed. This can occur seemingly randomly and may be accompanied by error codes related to the high voltage battery system or powertrain control module (PCM).
    * Solution: Diagnosis typically involves checking for diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) using a scan tool. Possible causes include issues with the battery management system (BMS), the drive motor inverter, or the motor itself. Depending on the diagnosis, the fix could involve replacing the BMS, inverter, or drive motor. In some cases, a software update to the PCM or BMS may resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the component requiring replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

**Direct Drive Transmission**

**Direct Drive Transmission**
* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported leaking rear shock absorbers. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, especially over bumps, and visible fluid leaks on the shock absorber body.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected shock absorbers. It's generally recommended to replace both rear shocks simultaneously to maintain balanced suspension performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (for parts and labor to replace both rear shocks)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    * Solution: A software update to the infotainment system may resolve the issue. In some cases, a full system reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1000+ (for infotainment unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Charging Issues (DC Fast Charging)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty initiating or maintaining DC fast charging. The car may fail to communicate with the charging station, resulting in a failed charge attempt. This can be related to the vehicle's charging system or the charging station itself.
    * Solution: Ensure the charging station is functioning correctly. If the problem persists, inspect the vehicle's charging port for damage or corrosion. A software update to the battery management system (BMS) or the charge control module may also be necessary. In rare cases, a faulty charging control module may require replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $500+ (for charge control module replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Heated Seats Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Heated seats failing to function. They may not turn on at all, or may only partially heat up.
    * Solution: Check the fuses. If the fuses are good, the heating element may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Taillight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported condensation buildup inside the taillight housings. This can be unsightly but typically doesn't affect the functionality of the lights.
    * Solution: Replacement of the taillight housing. Sealing the existing housing may offer a temporary solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (per taillight)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Discomfort (Front Seats)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some drivers and passengers have complained about the front seats being uncomfortable, particularly on longer trips. This is subjective, but commonly cited as a lack of adequate lumbar support or firm cushioning.
    * Solution: Aftermarket seat cushions or lumbar support accessories can improve comfort.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+ (depending on the accessory)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV, while being a good electric vehicle, has faced some significant issues, primarily related to the LG Chem battery cell defect that can cause fires. This issue is addressed through a recall involving a full battery replacement. Other issues, such as infotainment system glitches and DC fast charging problems, are typically less severe and can be addressed with software updates or component replacements. The cost to fix these issues varies widely, from free software updates to potentially expensive battery pack replacements covered under recall.
