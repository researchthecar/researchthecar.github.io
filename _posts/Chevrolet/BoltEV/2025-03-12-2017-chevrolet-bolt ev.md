The 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV marked General Motors' entry into the affordable, long-range electric vehicle market. It features a single electric motor and a single-speed transmission. The motor produces 200 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, providing quick acceleration and a fun driving experience. Owners generally appreciate the Bolt EV for its ample range, compact size, and lively performance. However, common complaints include a somewhat basic interior, firm ride quality, and the well-documented battery recall issues.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Electric Motor**

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing battery degradation over time, resulting in a decrease in the vehicle's overall range. The amount of degradation can vary depending on factors such as charging habits, climate, and usage. Some owners experience more rapid degradation than others.
    *   Solution: GM issued a software update to limit the battery's charging capacity to 80% in an attempt to mitigate further degradation. Some owners have had their battery packs replaced under warranty due to excessive degradation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement outside of warranty is very expensive, potentially exceeding $16,000.

*   **Battery Fire Risk (LG Chem Batteries)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A risk of fire originating in the high voltage battery pack. This issue stemmed from manufacturing defects in LG Chem battery cells produced at certain plants. The initial fires occurred while the car was parked and charging. The problem was attributed to two simultaneous manufacturing defects: a torn anode tab and a folded separator.
    *   Solution: GM issued multiple recalls. Initially, a software update limited the state of charge to 90%. Eventually, GM replaced the entire battery pack in affected vehicles with a new pack containing redesigned battery modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under recall.
    *   Recalls: 20E071000, 20V701000, 21V560000, 21V925000, 23V049000

**Single-Speed Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling stability, and potential noise from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per shock.

**Electrical**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power Error**
    * Description/Symptoms: The "Reduced Propulsion Power" message appears on the driver information center, often accompanied by a noticeable reduction in vehicle acceleration and speed. The vehicle may enter a limp-home mode to prevent damage. This issue can be caused by various factors, including problems with the battery management system (BMS), motor control module (MCM), or other electrical components.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is necessary to pinpoint the root cause of the error. The fix may involve replacing faulty sensors, modules, or wiring harnesses, or performing software updates to the BMS or MCM.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for diagnostic, parts and labor costs vary widely depending on the specific component needing replacement.

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions controlled through the system.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve the issue. If not, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for diagnostic, $500 - $1500+ for infotainment unit replacement (depending on sourcing).

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Seat Discomfort**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained about the seats being uncomfortable, particularly on longer drives. The seats may lack sufficient lumbar support or cushioning for optimal comfort.
    *   Solution: Aftermarket seat cushions or lumbar supports can improve comfort.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+ for aftermarket solutions.

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV had some notable issues, primarily related to its battery. The battery fire risk led to significant recalls and eventual battery replacements, making this the most severe and widely addressed problem. Battery degradation is also a concern for some owners, especially as the vehicles age. Aside from the battery issues, problems like rear shock absorber failure and infotainment system glitches are relatively common, and can range from a few hundred to a couple thousand dollars to fix. Despite these concerns, the Bolt EV continues to be a popular choice in the electric vehicle market, known for its long range and affordability. Addressing these common issues can help extend the vehicle's lifespan and maintain its performance.
