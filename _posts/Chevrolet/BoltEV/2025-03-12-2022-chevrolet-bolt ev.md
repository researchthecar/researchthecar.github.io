The 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EV is a popular all-electric hatchback known for its affordability and decent range. It is powered by a single electric motor that produces 200 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, driving the front wheels. There are no other engine or transmission options available as it's a dedicated EV. People generally like the Bolt EV for its nimble handling, quick acceleration, and spacious interior for its size. Some common dislikes include the firm ride, and some find the interior materials to be somewhat basic. It's also worth noting the battery recall situation that impacted earlier models, including the 2022.
