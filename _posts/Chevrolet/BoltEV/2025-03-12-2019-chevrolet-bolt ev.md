**Electric Motor**

**Single Electric Motor**

*   **Battery Cell Fire Risk**
    *   Description/Symptoms: LG Chem high voltage battery cells (NCM chemistry) may have manufacturing defects that increase the risk of fire. This could occur when charging to full capacity or when the battery is at or near full charge. Symptoms may include smoke or fire emanating from the battery pack.
    *   Solution: GM issued multiple recalls to address this issue. The final remedy involved replacing the entire battery pack with a new pack containing cells from a different supplier (LG Energy Solution) with updated manufacturing processes and defect detection. A software update was also available to limit the charge capacity to 80% as an interim solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under recall - $0 (Battery pack replacement can cost upwards of $15,000 if not covered by warranty or recall).
    *   Recalls: N202313040 (originally N202309040), N212328980, N212341120, N232415130

**Electrical System**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power/Service High Voltage Charging System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent "Reduced Propulsion Power" warnings on the dashboard, along with potential "Service High Voltage Charging System" messages. The vehicle may experience reduced acceleration or the inability to charge.
    *   Solution: This is often caused by the High Voltage Battery Energy Control Module. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to battery pack voltage or communication issues between modules may be present. The BECM may require replacement or software recalibration.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ depending on the required repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive to touch, or crashes and restarts. This can affect access to climate controls, radio, and navigation.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released to address these issues. Performing a hard reset of the system (if possible) may also provide a temporary fix. In some cases, the infotainment module may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $800+ (Module Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Struts Failing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch struggles to stay open on its own and/or slowly drifts downward.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Discomfort**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complaints of uncomfortable seats, particularly on longer drives. This is a subjective issue but frequently cited.
    *   Solution: Aftermarket seat cushions or seat modifications.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $500+ (depending on solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorbers Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure and leaking of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV is a generally reliable electric vehicle. The most significant issue owners face is the high-voltage battery fire risk stemming from potentially defective LG Chem battery cells. This issue was addressed with a recall involving battery pack replacement, mitigating the safety concern. Other common complaints include electrical issues and infotainment glitches, but these tend to be less severe. Suspension issues are possible but are not uncommon among vehicles of this age. Most issues are relatively inexpensive to repair, but a battery replacement can be costly if not covered by a recall or warranty.
