The 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV is an all-electric hatchback known for its affordability, ample range, and practicality. It boasts a single electric motor producing 200 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. The Bolt EV does not have different engine and transmission options, as it is purely electric. Owners often appreciate its quick acceleration, spacious interior for its size, and relatively long driving range. Criticisms often include the firm ride and some interior material choices. However, the largest issue many owners have is with the battery.

Symptoms can range from no apparent issues to smoke or fire emanating from the battery pack. Owners may also experience a "reduced propulsion power" message or inability to charge the vehicle.
    *   Solution: A software update was initially released that limited the battery charge to 80% to mitigate the risk. The permanent fix involved replacing the entire high-voltage battery pack.

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV is a compelling electric vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues reported by owners. The most significant is the battery fire risk and subsequent recall, which has been addressed by Chevrolet through battery replacements. Other, less severe issues include infotainment system glitches, charging problems, and some exterior/interior concerns. While the battery recall is a major concern, the fact that it's addressed by Chevrolet mitigates the risk for current and prospective owners. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially serious safety hazards, but with the battery issue addressed, the Bolt EV can be a reliable and affordable electric vehicle.
