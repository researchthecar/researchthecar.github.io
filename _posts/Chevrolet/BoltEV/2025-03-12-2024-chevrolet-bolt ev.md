Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2024 Chevrolet Bolt EV, categorized by major components.

The 2024 Chevrolet Bolt EV is a popular all-electric subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and impressive range. It is powered by a single, front-mounted electric motor that delivers 200 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. There is only one powertrain option for this model. People generally like the Bolt EV for its peppy acceleration, practical hatchback design, and relatively long range for its price point. However, some common dislikes include the basic interior materials, somewhat stiff ride, and limited fast charging speeds compared to some newer EVs.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Motor (200 hp, 266 lb-ft)**
*   **Reduced Propulsion Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may display a "Reduced Propulsion Power" message on the Driver Information Center (DIC). This can result in significantly decreased acceleration and top speed, making the vehicle feel sluggish. The car may run normally for a period of time and then suddenly have reduced propulsion power.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is needed to pinpoint the root cause. Common causes include issues with the Battery Energy Control Module (BECM), drive motor inverter, or the electric motor itself. Repair could involve replacing any of these components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the failed component and the shop rates.

**Battery**
*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Software Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The BMS is responsible for managing the battery's charging, discharging, and overall health. Glitches can lead to inaccurate state-of-charge readings, premature battery degradation warnings, or even charging failures.
    *   Solution: A software update to the BMS is usually required to address these glitches. The update often fine-tunes the battery management algorithms to improve accuracy and prevent false warnings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Usually covered under warranty; otherwise, a dealer software reflash could range from $100-$200.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Charging System**

*   **Level 2 Charging Intermittency**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent charging when using a Level 2 charger at home or at public charging stations. The vehicle may abruptly stop charging or refuse to initiate charging. This can often be caused by a fault in the charging port in the car itself or the onboard charging module.
    *   Solution: Have the charging port inspected for debris, corrosion, or damaged pins. Have the onboard charging module checked. Replacement of a damaged charging port or the onboard charging module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1500+ depending on the failed component.

**Electrical System**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (screen, radio, navigation, etc.) occasionally freezes or crashes, requiring a restart (either manual or automatic). This can disrupt audio playback, navigation, and access to vehicle settings.
    *   Solution: Software updates are typically released by Chevrolet to address these bugs. Performing a system reset (if possible) can sometimes provide a temporary fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free; replacement of the infotainment unit could cost $500-$1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Problems with the 12-Volt Battery**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12-volt battery in the car dying even though it's new or replaced.
    *   Solution: Install a known good battery and bring the vehicle into a dealership or shop and have them test the charging system. The charging system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000+

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, causing a cloudy or foggy appearance. This can reduce headlight output and visibility, especially at night.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000 per headlight.

**Interior**

*   **Seat Discomfort (Long Drives)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers find the seats uncomfortable on long drives, lacking sufficient lumbar support or cushioning.
    *   Solution: Using aftermarket seat cushions or lumbar support accessories to improve comfort.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+ for aftermarket accessories.

**Summary**

The 2024 Chevrolet Bolt EV, while offering a compelling value proposition in the EV market, does have some recurring issues owners should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the electric motor/battery pack with reduced propulsion power and charging system glitches, which can lead to inconvenience and potentially costly repairs if not covered by warranty. Other electrical issues, like infotainment problems, are less severe but can still be frustrating. Overall, while not every Bolt EV will experience these issues, prospective buyers should research and be prepared for the possibility, as well as ensure they understand the warranty coverage.
