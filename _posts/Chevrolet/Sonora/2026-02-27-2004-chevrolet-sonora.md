### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chevrolet Sonora, particularly with its V8 engine options, presents a generally solid platform with some common areas of concern. Powertrain reliability is decent, though the 5.3L's Active Fuel Management system can be a source of issues. Transmission durability is fair, with torque converter clutch problems being a notable, albeit repairable, issue. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are typical wear items for a vehicle of this age and weight. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and alternator failures are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate, and interior climate control actuators are a common fix. Overall, the Sonora is a capable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific technical points and budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the AFM system and transmission.
