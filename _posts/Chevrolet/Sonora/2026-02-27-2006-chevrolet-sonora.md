### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chevrolet Sonora, particularly with its V8 engine options, presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain is generally robust, specific components like intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines on the 4.8L and 6.0L engines, and the Active Fuel Management system on the 5.3L, are known weak points requiring attention. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60-E, can be costly to repair. Suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links are typical wear items for a vehicle of this age and weight. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Exterior paint degradation and interior comfort features like seat heaters and HVAC controls are also areas where owners may encounter problems. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, the Sonora demands diligent maintenance and awareness of its common issues to ensure continued reliability.
