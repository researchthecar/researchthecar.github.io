Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2004 Chevrolet Sonora, organized by category and engine/transmission options. Please note that "Chevrolet Sonora" isn't a standard Chevrolet model. It is possible that you are thinking of the Chevrolet Suburban, Tahoe, or Silverado. Since this query is about providing a response based on the model provided, I will use the assumption that the Chevrolet Sonora is a vehicle available in Mexico. The Chevrolet Sonora is a rebadged Chevrolet Tahoe sold in Mexico. Therefore, the engine and transmission options should be:

The 2004 Chevrolet Sonora (Tahoe) is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness and towing capability. Engine options typically included a 4.8L V8 producing around 285 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 producing around 295 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were generally paired with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the vehicle's comfort and cargo space but often cite fuel economy and some reliability concerns as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**4.8L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil additions between scheduled changes. This can sometimes be linked to worn valve seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: In cases of excessive oil consumption, possible solutions can range from using higher-viscosity oil to replacing valve seals or piston rings. A compression test can help diagnose the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks externally or internally into the engine which causes overheating and coolant loss.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gasket
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.8L, the 5.3L V8 can also experience excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Similar to the 4.8L. Possible solutions can range from using higher-viscosity oil to replacing valve seals or piston rings. A compression test can help diagnose the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knock Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The knock sensors can fail, leading to a check engine light and potentially reduced engine performance due to the engine control unit (ECU) retarding timing to prevent engine knock.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty knock sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4L60E is known to develop delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. This can be due to worn valve body components or a failing transmission.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush *may* temporarily improve the issue, but a valve body rebuild or transmission replacement is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause shuddering, stalling, or complete loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, often along with a transmission service.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the front suspension ball joints is a common issue. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front end, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints. It is often recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn shock absorbers lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased braking distances.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front and/or rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on quality and if front/rear are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failures of the instrument cluster, including gauges not working properly or flickering.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster. Sometimes, a faulty stepper motor within the cluster is the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on if repair or replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning power windows and door locks, often due to faulty switches or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the specific wiring fault or replacing the faulty switch or actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (per window/door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower body panels, especially around the wheel wells and rocker panels, is a common problem, particularly in areas with road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on severity and extent of repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (cover or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises from behind the dashboard and/or inconsistent temperature control. This is often caused by a failing HVAC actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty HVAC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Chevrolet Sonora (Tahoe) can present several issues, with engine oil consumption and transmission problems (particularly with the 4L60E) being relatively common and potentially costly to address. Suspension components and electrical issues also arise. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission work, can be significant investments. Careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
