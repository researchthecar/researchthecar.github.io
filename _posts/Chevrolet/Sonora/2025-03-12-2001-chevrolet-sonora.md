Unfortunately, "Chevrolet Sonora" is not a valid Chevrolet model. I believe there may be a typo. Are you possibly referring to the Chevrolet *Sonoma* or the Chevrolet *Suburban*? Both vehicles were sold in the 2001 model year.

If the correct vehicle is the Chevrolet Sonoma, a compact pickup truck produced from 1991 to 2004, people often praise its reliability and fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder engine), its compact size for easy maneuverability, and its affordability. Common complaints include a somewhat dated interior, limited rear seat space in extended cab models, and potential rust issues depending on the region. The 2001 Sonoma came with several engine options: a 2.2L inline-4 (120 hp, 140 lb-ft of torque), a 4.3L V6 (190 hp, 250 lb-ft of torque), and a high-output 4.3L V6 (180 hp, 245 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

If the correct vehicle is the Chevrolet Suburban, a full-size SUV praised for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Common complaints often include poor fuel economy, its large size making it difficult to park, and certain model years being prone to specific electrical issues. The 2001 Suburban was offered with two primary engine options: a 5.3L V8 (285 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.0L V8 (300 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

Please let me know which vehicle you meant so I can provide the information you requested.
