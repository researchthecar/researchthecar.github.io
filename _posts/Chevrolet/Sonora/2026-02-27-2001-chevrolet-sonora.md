### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet Sonora, particularly with its V8 engine options, offers a generally robust platform. However, common issues to be aware of include potential leaks from the intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines, which can lead to more significant engine problems if neglected. Transmission reliability, specifically with the 4L60-E, can be a concern, with torque converter clutch issues and downshift clunks being reported. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention due to age and mileage. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster and HVAC resistor failures, are also noted. While not inherently unreliable, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
