### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet Sonora, particularly with its V8 engine options, is a capable vehicle but exhibits some common issues typical for its age and platform. The most frequently cited concerns revolve around the powertrain, specifically potential leaks from oil cooler lines on all V8s and Active Fuel Management (AFM) system problems on the 5.3L. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60-E, can arise, often related to the torque converter. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM or alternator, can also occur. Rust is a notable concern for the exterior, and interior wear, especially on seats and HVAC blend doors, is not uncommon. Despite these potential issues, many Sonoras remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
