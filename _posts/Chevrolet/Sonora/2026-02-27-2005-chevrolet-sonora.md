### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Sonora, particularly with its V8 engine options, presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain is generally robust, specific components like the Active Fuel Management system on the 5.3L engine and intake manifold gaskets across V8s are known weak points requiring attention. Transmission issues, especially with the 4L60-E, can be costly to repair. Suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM or alternator, can be frustrating. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior comfort features like HVAC blowers can fail. Overall, the Sonora can be a dependable vehicle if these common issues are proactively addressed or repaired.
