The 2003 Chevrolet Sonora is not a recognized model name. Are you referring to the Chevrolet Suburban? If so, I can provide information about the 2003 Chevrolet Suburban. Otherwise, I do not have any information about the 2003 Chevrolet Sonora.

Assuming you are referring to the 2003 Chevrolet Suburban:

The 2003 Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness and towing capacity. Engine options included a 5.3L V8 (290 hp, 325 lb-ft torque) and a 6.0L V8 (320 hp, 360 lb-ft torque). Both engines were paired with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciated the Suburban's passenger and cargo space, comfortable ride, and robust towing capabilities. Common complaints included lower fuel economy, potential for mechanical issues due to age, and the overall large size making it less maneuverable in tight spaces.

**Summary**

The 2003 Chevrolet Suburban, assuming that's the vehicle meant by "Sonora," can be a reliable vehicle, but it's important to be aware of potential issues due to its age. Engine problems like oil consumption and knocking sounds can range in severity and cost. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60E, are also common and can be expensive to repair. Suspension and electrical problems are to be expected on a vehicle of this age. Address these issues early to prevent more costly repairs down the road.
