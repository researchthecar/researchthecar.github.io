The 2006 Chevrolet Sonora, also known as the Chevrolet Suburban in other markets, is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 5.3L V8 (310 hp, 335 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.0L V8. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Suburban's ability to haul large families and cargo, while common complaints include its size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces and its relatively poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, especially in later years when AFM components degrade. Can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter damage, and eventual engine failure. Ticking or knocking noises can be heard.
    *   Solution: Disable AFM using a tuner or replace the AFM lifters and related components with non-AFM parts. Replacing the AFM Valve Lifter Oil Manifold/Filter and the intake manifold gasket and bolts is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and chosen solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Oil Pressure Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate oil pressure readings on the dashboard gauge, or a "check engine" light with a P0521 or similar code. Sometimes it shows 0.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **Valve Spring Failure (Early Production)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, loss of power, especially at higher RPMs. Often accompanied by a ticking or tapping noise.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve springs with updated, higher-quality springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or exhaust leak noise, especially when the engine is cold. Over time, this can cause a warped manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken bolts. May require manifold replacement if warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on bolt accessibility and manifold condition)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, slipping out of gear, especially at higher mileage. Often occurs after the transmission heats up.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid flush and filter change may help. More serious cases may require a valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at highway speeds when the TCC engages. Can lead to a "check engine" light.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Flushing the transmission cooler lines is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Autoride Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, air compressor running constantly, "service ride control" message on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replace the air shocks and/or air compressor. Conversion to standard shocks is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on parts replaced and brand)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End Clunking/Popping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noise coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn ball joints, tie rod ends, and sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 (per side, depending on parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.) malfunctioning or reading incorrectly. Intermittent flickering or complete failure of the cluster.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows not working, or door locks malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty window motors, door lock actuators, or wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400 (per door/window)

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and lower doors. Especially prevalent in areas with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the rusted panels. Preventing rust with proper maintenance is important.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Actuator Problems**

**Summary**

The 2006 Chevrolet Sonora can be a reliable vehicle, but it's essential to be aware of the potential issues. Engine issues, particularly with AFM-equipped 5.3L engines, can be costly. Suspension and electrical problems are also common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. Checking for rust and carefully inspecting the suspension are highly recommended before purchasing a used model.
