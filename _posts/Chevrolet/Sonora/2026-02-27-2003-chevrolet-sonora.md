### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet Sonora is a capable full-size SUV with a generally solid reputation, but it is not without its potential issues. Owners should be aware of common problems such as intake manifold gasket leaks and oil pressure sensor failures on the Vortec V8 engines, particularly the 5.3L and 6.0L variants which can also suffer from Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter issues. Transmission reliability is decent, though the 4L60-E can experience torque converter or 3-4 clutch pack problems. Suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often traced to the BCM or alternator, can also occur. Exterior rust, especially on the frame, is a concern for vehicles in corrosive environments. Interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure are also noted. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential weak spots, the Sonora can remain a dependable vehicle.
