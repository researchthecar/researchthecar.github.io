The 2002 Chevrolet Sonora is not a valid car model. The Chevy Suburban, Tahoe, and Avalanche were available in 2002, and that is what I will be using for this response. The 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size SUV that was popular for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. It was available with a few different engine options: a 4.8L V8 (275 hp, 290 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L V8 (285 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L V8 (320 hp, 360 lb-ft of torque). The transmission was typically a 4-speed automatic. People often liked the Tahoe for its versatility and ability to haul cargo and passengers, while some common complaints included its fuel economy and relatively bland styling.

Engine issues, such as intake manifold gasket leaks, oil consumption, and knock sensor failures, can range from moderate to severe in terms of cost and impact. Transmission problems like harsh shifting or slipping can also be costly to repair. Suspension issues, such as sagging rear suspension and worn ball joints, can affect the vehicle's ride quality and handling. Electrical problems, like instrument cluster issues and door lock actuator failure, can be annoying and require attention. Exterior rust can be a concern, especially on the rocker panels and wheel arches.
