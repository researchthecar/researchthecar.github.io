The 2013 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and spacious interior. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 and a 3.6L V6. The 2.4L engine produces 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.6L V6 generates 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Equinox's comfortable ride and decent gas mileage, but common complaints include excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine, timing chain issues, and some electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, often exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. May be accompanied by blue exhaust smoke, low oil level warnings, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: GM released a technical service bulletin (TSB) related to this issue. It may require replacing the piston rings, pistons, and possibly other engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or break, leading to rough running, misfires, check engine light activation (specifically P0016 or P0017 codes), and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, sprockets, and guides is the typical repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, stalling, check engine light. Can be caused by fuel contamination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200

    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300 (fluid/filter), $800 - $1,500+ (valve body), $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery after short periods of inactivity, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing parasitic draw by testing each electrical component of the vehicle. Repairing the circuit that is causing the battery drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
