The 2008 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV that offered a blend of practicality and comfort. Available engine options included a 3.4L V6 producing 185 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L V6. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Equinox for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. However, common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly concerning the powertrain and electrical systems, as well as lower than expected fuel economy for the 3.4L.

**Engine**

**3.4L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the valve stem seals or piston rings can reduce oil consumption. However, in severe cases, engine replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the intake manifold gasket, leading to overheating, coolant loss, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a sweet smell, low coolant levels, and white smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, poor fuel economy, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both 3.4L and 3.6L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or harsh shifting between gears, transmission slipping, and a general lack of responsiveness. Can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change might temporarily alleviate the issue. However, often requires valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, stalling, and poor acceleration. The check engine light might illuminate.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
     *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Humming, roaring, or grinding noises coming from the wheels, especially at higher speeds. Excessive play in the wheel when inspected.
    *   Solution: Wheel bearing replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500 per wheel

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Strut/shock absorber replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per corner
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a few days, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This could be a faulty relay, a malfunctioning module, or a short circuit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)

**Summary**

The 2008 Chevrolet Equinox, while offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior, is prone to several common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 3.4L V6, such as excessive oil consumption and intake manifold gasket failure, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, like harsh shifting and torque converter failure, are also prevalent. Electrical problems, such as power window failure and battery drain, add to the potential ownership costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and the associated costs can vary significantly.
