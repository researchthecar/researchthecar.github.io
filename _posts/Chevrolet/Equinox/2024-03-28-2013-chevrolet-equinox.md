**Introduction**

The 2013 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV that was available with three engine options: a 2.4L 4-cylinder (182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder (264 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual (only available with the 2.4L engine). The Equinox was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and excellent fuel economy. However, it was also criticized for its bland styling, lack of power from the base engine, and poor handling.
