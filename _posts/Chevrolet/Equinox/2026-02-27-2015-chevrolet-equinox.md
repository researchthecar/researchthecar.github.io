### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Chevrolet Equinox presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components like the chassis and exterior/interior generally hold up well, owners should be mindful of potential issues with the 2.4L engine's oil consumption and timing chain, as well as similar timing chain concerns in the 3.6L V6.
