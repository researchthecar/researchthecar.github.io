The 2017 Chevrolet Equinox is a popular compact SUV offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior. It came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Equinox for its smooth ride and fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.4L engine). However, common complaints include the sometimes sluggish acceleration of the 2.4L engine, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil, sometimes requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed. Blue smoke from the exhaust can also be a symptom.
    *   Solution: GM released a technical service bulletin (TSB) addressing this issue (e.g., PIP5337D). The recommended fix often involves replacing the piston rings and possibly other engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The High Pressure Fuel Pump fails causing the car to go into reduced engine power mode, and the car will not accelerate properly. The car may also stall at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Replace the High Pressure Fuel Pump and high pressure fuel line.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission exhibits rough or delayed shifts between gears. It may also feel like the transmission is slipping, especially during acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update (reprogramming the transmission control module - TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, internal transmission damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for reprogramming; $2,500 - $4,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not in use, leading to starting problems.
    * Solution: Locate the source of the parasitic draw (often an accessory or module not shutting down properly) and repair/replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component causing the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Stabilitrak/Traction Control Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Warning lights illuminate for Stabilitrak and/or Traction Control systems. This may or may not be accompanied by a noticeable change in vehicle handling. Erroneous sensor readings or module failures are possible causes.
    * Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty sensor or module (wheel speed sensor, steering angle sensor, etc.). Replacement of the defective part.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ depending on the part and labor involved.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing in the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Equinox has some common issues, particularly related to the 2.4L engine's oil consumption. Electrical problems can also occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. The excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine is the most concerning due to the potential for severe engine damage. It's important to inspect the vehicle thoroughly and obtain a pre-purchase inspection to identify any potential problems before buying a used 2017 Equinox.
