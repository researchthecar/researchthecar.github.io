### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Chevrolet Equinox presents a generally reliable profile for a compact SUV. The 1.5L turbocharged engine has seen some reports of oil dilution, which is often manageable with software updates or diligent maintenance, and occasional turbocharger issues. The 2.0L turbo engine and both transmission options (6-speed and 9-speed automatics) appear more robust, with fewer documented widespread problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are present but not overwhelmingly common. The suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from significant recurring defects. Overall, the Equinox is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the minor engine and electrical concerns associated with the 1.5L engine and infotainment system.
