The 2015 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV available in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive. It comes standard with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 182 horsepower and 172 pound-feet of torque. A 3.6-liter V6 engine that produces 301 horsepower and 272 pound-feet of torque is available as an upgrade. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.
