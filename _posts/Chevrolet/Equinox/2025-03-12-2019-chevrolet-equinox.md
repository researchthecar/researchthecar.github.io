Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2019 Chevrolet Equinox, organized by category and powertrain configuration.

The 2019 Chevrolet Equinox is a popular compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues. Engine options include a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L Turbo Diesel. The 1.5L engine is generally praised for its fuel efficiency, while the 2.0L offers more spirited acceleration. The 1.6L diesel was only available for a few years, but offered greater fuel economy, but was discontinued in 2019. Common dislikes include the base engine's lack of power, some interior materials feeling cheap, and occasional electronic glitches. All engines are paired with a 6-speed or 9-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4 (LYX)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, sometimes requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve or valve cover has been found to mitigate the issue. More severe cases might require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for PCV Valve or Valve Cover replacement. $2,000 - $4,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Shutter/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported an engine shutter, hesitation, or stumble, especially during acceleration or when the engine is cold. This can sometimes be accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include faulty spark plugs, coil packs, or issues with the fuel injectors. A diagnostic scan is needed to pinpoint the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (LTG)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**1.6L Turbo Diesel (LH7)**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (MH8, Used with 1.6L Diesel)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (GF6, Used with 1.5L Turbo)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6-speed automatic transmission has reports of harsh or erratic shifting, especially between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or "jerk" during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush or replacement of faulty solenoids might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for software update, $150 - $400+ for fluid flush, $300 - $800+ for solenoid replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (9T50, Used with 2.0L Turbo)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 6-speed, some owners report harsh shifting, hesitation, or delayed engagement with the 9-speed automatic. This is often most noticeable at lower speeds or during stop-and-go traffic.
    *   Solution: As with the 6-speed, a software update to the TCM is often the first step. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for software update, $800 - $2,000+ for valve body replacement, $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature wear of suspension components such as struts, shocks, and sway bar links. This can manifest as excessive noise (clunking or rattling) from the suspension, poor ride quality, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components. It's advisable to replace components in pairs (e.g., both struts or both sway bar links).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per component, depending on the part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the infotainment system, including screen freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset by holding down the power button. Software updates from the dealer might also address these issues. In some cases, the head unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for a reset, $100 - $300+ for software updates (if not covered under warranty), $500 - $1500+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by parasitic draws or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic test to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Replacement of the battery if it's found to be faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for diagnostic test, $150 - $300+ for battery replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Cracked Windshield**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Complaints about the comfort of the seats, particularly on longer drives. Lack of sufficient lumbar support is a common complaint.
    *   Solution: Aftermarket seat cushions or lumbar support systems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks originating from the sunroof, often due to clogged drain tubes.
