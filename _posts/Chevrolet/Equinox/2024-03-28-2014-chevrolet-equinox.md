**Introduction**

The 2014 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV that offers a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 2.4-liter inline-four with 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. A 3.6-liter V6 with 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque is available as an upgrade. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available as an option.

The Equinox is a popular choice for families and commuters alike. It offers a comfortable interior, plenty of cargo space, and good fuel economy. However, there are a few common issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.4-Liter Inline-Four**

* **Intake Manifold Leak:** Intake manifold gasket failure, causing a vacuum leak. Symptoms include rough idle, poor performance, and increased emissions. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
* **Timing Chain Failure:** Premature wear of the timing chain, leading to engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, loss of power, and eventually engine failure. Solution: Replace the timing chain and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-ups or leading to engine damage. Symptoms include low oil levels, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a loss of power. No definitive solution, but measures include:
    * Change oil more frequently
    * Use high-quality oil
    * Monitor oil levels closely

**3.6-Liter V6**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Failure of the valve cover gasket, causing an oil leak. Symptoms include oil leaking from the engine, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels. Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Exhaust Manifold Cracking:** Cracking of the exhaust manifold, leading to exhaust leaks and reduced engine performance. Symptoms include loud exhaust noises, a loss of power, and poor fuel economy. Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Problems:** Difficulty shifting gears, delayed shifts, or slipping gears. Symptoms include rough shifting, a loss of power, and difficulty accelerating. Solution: May involve replacing transmission components such as solenoids, clutches, or the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
* **Transmission Failure:** Complete failure of the transmission, rendering the vehicle inoperable. Symptoms include no movement when shifting gears, a grinding noise, and a loss of power. Solution: Replace the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
