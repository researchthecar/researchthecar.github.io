### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Chevrolet Equinox presents a mixed reliability profile. While the 2.4L engine is generally less problematic than the 3.6L V6, both can experience significant issues like oil consumption and timing chain problems, respectively. The automatic transmission can also be a source of concern with harsh shifting. Suspension components like struts and control arm bushings are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are also noted. Exterior rust can be an issue on lower body panels. Interior climate control blend doors are another common repair. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs, especially concerning the powertrain and electrical systems, beyond standard maintenance.
