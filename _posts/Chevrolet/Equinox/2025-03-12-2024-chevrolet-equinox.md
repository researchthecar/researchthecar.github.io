The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox is a popular compact SUV offering a comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and a user-friendly infotainment system. However, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential issues. The sole engine option for the 2024 Equinox is a 1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4 engine producing 175 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its fuel efficiency and value, but some dislike its somewhat lackluster acceleration and interior material quality.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or stalling, particularly during acceleration or when the engine is cold. This may be related to the fuel delivery system or the turbocharger.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is necessary to pinpoint the cause. Potential fixes include fuel injector cleaning or replacement, turbocharger inspection and repair/replacement, or software updates to the engine control module (ECM).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,500+ depending on the component that is affected
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners may notice a need to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes.
    * Solution: Diagnosis is necessary to rule out leaks. If no leaks are present, a compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source of oil consumption. Potential fixes include piston ring replacement or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$5,000+ depending on the component that is affected
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears.
    * Solution: Initial steps may include checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, a fluid change may be necessary. If the issue persists, further diagnosis may be required, potentially involving valve body inspection or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,500+ depending on the component that is affected
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission may feel like it is slipping in and out of gear as you accelerate, or there may be a delay when shifting.
    * Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition, perform a transmission service. If the condition persists, may need a transmission valve body replacement or full transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$4,000+ depending on the component that is affected
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Bushings**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with premature wear in suspension components such as the control arm bushings. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, and degraded handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**

    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control features.
    *   Solution: Try a soft reset of the system. If the problem persists, a software update may be required. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,500+ (Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced excessive battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially if it sits for a few days.
    *   Solution: Testing the battery and charging system is the first step. A parasitic draw test can help identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories or a faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard**

    *   Solution: Locating and securing the source of the rattle. This may involve adding foam padding or tightening loose fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Poor Quality of Interior Trim Pieces**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained about the low-quality feel and appearance of certain interior trim pieces, such as the plastic on the dashboard or door panels.
    *   Solution: There is no easy solution to this issue. Some owners have replaced trim pieces with aftermarket options, but this can be costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Chevrolet Equinox can be a reliable vehicle but has the potential for some common issues. Engine hesitation/stalling and excessive oil consumption can be major concerns with potentially high repair costs. Harsh shifting of the transmission is a possible issue to look out for. Electrical issues, like infotainment glitches and battery drain, can be frustrating, but the suspension and interior complaints are less critical. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
