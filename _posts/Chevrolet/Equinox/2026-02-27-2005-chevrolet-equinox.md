### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Equinox is a vehicle that, at its age, is likely to require attention to certain common issues. The V6 engine is more prone to intake manifold leaks and valve cover gasket leaks, while the 4-cylinder can experience timing chain and oil consumption problems. Transmission issues like slipping and torque converter problems are also noted. Suspension components such as struts and ball joints are typical wear items that may need replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior components like blend door actuators and power window regulators are also known failure points. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repairs and factor them into their decision.
