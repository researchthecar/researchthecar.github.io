The 2010 Chevrolet Equinox marked a significant redesign for the vehicle, moving to a more fuel-efficient platform and offering a more modern design. The 2010 Equinox came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 generating 264 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Equinox's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel economy, especially with the 2.4L engine. However, some common complaints revolved around engine issues, particularly excessive oil consumption and timing chain problems, as well as some electrical glitches and interior trim concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2.4L Equinox owners have reported excessive oil consumption, sometimes exceeding a quart every 1,000 miles. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil, blue exhaust smoke (indicating burning oil), and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: GM released a technical service bulletin (TSB) related to piston ring issues that can cause this problem. A revised piston and piston ring design helps resolve this issue. The fix typically involves replacing the pistons and piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to rough running, misfires, and potential engine damage. Symptoms may include a rattling noise upon startup, check engine light illumination, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioner is the recommended solution. It's often advisable to replace the water pump at the same time, as it's accessible during the timing chain replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. Transmission slipping (where the engine revs but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly) can also occur.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. Other times, replacing the valve body or rebuilding/replacing the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (Software Update), $800 - $1,500 (Valve Body), $3,000 - $5,000+ (Transmission Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Coil Spring Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear coil springs can break, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt. Symptoms include a clunking noise from the rear suspension, uneven vehicle ride height, and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken coil springs is the solution. It's generally recommended to replace both rear coil springs at the same time to ensure even suspension performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows can stop working intermittently or completely. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, switch, or wiring harness.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the failure is essential. Replacing the window motor, switch, or repairing damaged wiring can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Stabilitrak/Traction Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Stabilitrak and traction control systems may malfunction, triggering warning lights on the dashboard. This can be caused by a faulty wheel speed sensor, steering angle sensor, or a problem with the electronic brake control module (EBCM).
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause is crucial. Replacing the faulty sensor or module is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Sensor Replacement), $500 - $1,000+ (EBCM Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor can fail, resulting in no air blowing from the vents. This can be caused by a faulty blower motor, resistor, or wiring.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor or resistor is the solution. Diagnosing the wiring is also important to ensure it is not the source of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Chevrolet Equinox, while generally a popular choice, can suffer from some notable issues. The 2.4L engine is prone to excessive oil consumption and timing chain failures, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues such as harsh shifting can also be prevalent. Electrical glitches with the power windows and stabilitrak systems can also occur, along with interior issues such as HVAC blower motor failure. Addressing these problems can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect any used 2010 Equinox before purchasing.
