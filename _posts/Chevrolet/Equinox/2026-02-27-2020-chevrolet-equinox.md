### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Chevrolet Equinox is a generally reliable vehicle, with its 2.0L turbo engine and 9-speed automatic transmission showing fewer reported issues than the base 1.5L engine and 6-speed automatic. Common concerns, such as coolant leaks and infotainment glitches, are not typically catastrophic and often addressable with software updates or component replacements. The suspension, electrical systems (outside of infotainment), exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread problems. Owners should be aware of potential issues with the 1.5L engine's oil consumption and the 6-speed transmission's occasional hesitation, but overall, the Equinox offers a dependable experience for its class.
