The 2015 Chevrolet Equinox is a popular compact SUV known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 and a 3.6L V6, both paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.4L engine produces 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. People generally like the Equinox for its fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.4L engine) and its quiet cabin. Common dislikes include its somewhat lackluster acceleration with the base engine and reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, sometimes requiring a quart every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to engine damage and potential failure if not monitored and addressed. Blue smoke from the exhaust is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: GM released a technical service bulletin (TSB) and extended the warranty for piston ring issues in certain 2010-2013 Equinox models. For vehicles outside that range but still exhibiting the issue, the typical fix involves replacing the pistons and piston rings with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Stalling while driving, rough idling, lack of power, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. Check engine light with codes related to camshaft position. Engine misfires and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Transmission slipping or hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Coil Springs**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, uneven tire wear, clunking noises from the rear suspension, reduced ride comfort.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery after short periods of non-use. Difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing parasitic draw. This may involve identifying and replacing faulty modules or components that are drawing power when the vehicle is off. Common culprits include the radio, OnStar module, or body control module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (diagnosis) - $500+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Instrument Panel Cluster**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument panel gauges (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, etc.). Warning lights may also malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the instrument panel cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning blows warm air, or the temperature fluctuates.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a problem with the blend door actuator. The solution would be to repair the leak, replace the compressor, or replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Equinox has some notable issues, particularly with the 2.4L engine's oil consumption and potential transmission problems. These issues can be quite costly to repair, potentially ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. While some problems like battery drain or instrument cluster failures can be inconvenient, the engine and transmission issues pose the biggest concern in terms of reliability and potential repair costs. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used Equinox before purchasing, paying particular attention to engine oil levels and transmission performance.
