The 2016 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Equinox for its smooth ride and user-friendly infotainment system, but some common complaints include excessive oil consumption (particularly with the 2.4L engine), transmission issues, and certain electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported excessive oil consumption, sometimes requiring oil to be added every 1,000 miles or less. Symptoms include low oil light illumination, engine knocking, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: GM issued a service bulletin and extended warranty coverage for certain 2010-2017 Equinox models with the 2.4L engine to address this issue. The repair typically involves a revised piston ring design, piston replacement, and potentially connecting rods.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HPFP failure causes the vehicle to go into limp mode, preventing the car from accelerating above idle speed.
    *   Solution: Replace the high pressure fuel pump and flush the fuel lines of metal shavings from the failed HPFP
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or wear prematurely, leading to engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and possibly other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, solutions can range from a transmission fluid flush and fill to valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) to $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of suspension components such as ball joints, tie rod ends, and struts/shocks. This can lead to noises, vibrations, and poor handling.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
