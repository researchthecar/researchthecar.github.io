### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Chevrolet Equinox generally presents a decent reliability record, but potential buyers and owners should be aware of specific common issues. The 2.4L engine is more prone to oil consumption and timing chain problems than the 3.6L V6, though the V6 can also experience timing chain issues and intake manifold leaks. Transmission problems, particularly harsh shifting, are also a concern for the 6-speed automatic. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and infotainment system can occur. Suspension issues like failing strut mounts are relatively minor and common for vehicles of this age. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical failures, proactive maintenance and awareness of these potential issues are recommended for optimal ownership.
