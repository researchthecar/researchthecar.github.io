Alright, here is a breakdown of common problems and complaints for the 2012 Chevrolet Equinox, categorized by component and engine/transmission configuration. The 2012 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. However, it does have some known issues. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 and a 3.0L V6, both paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.4L engine produces around 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. People generally appreciate the Equinox for its spacious interior and good gas mileage, but common complaints often revolve around engine issues, particularly oil consumption, and some electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L engine is known for consuming excessive amounts of oil, sometimes more than 1 quart every 1,000 miles. This can lead to low oil levels, engine damage, and eventually engine failure if not monitored and addressed. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: GM released a technical service bulletin and extended warranty coverage for piston ring failure on certain 2.4L engines. The repair typically involves replacing the piston rings, or, in severe cases, replacing the entire engine. Some owners have also had success with installing an oil catch can.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on severity and repair choice - piston rings vs. engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The High Pressure Fuel Pump can fail causing the engine to not start and or stall while driving.
    *   Solution: Replacing the fuel pump will resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1200+ (part and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement. These issues can stem from valve body problems, worn clutch packs, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may help in some cases. However, often the valve body needs to be replaced or rebuilt, or the entire transmission requires replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners sometimes report the struts and shocks wearing out prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride and reduced handling performance. This can be exacerbated by rough road conditions.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shocks with new ones.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Power Windows/Locks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows and door locks. This is often due to a faulty window motor, door lock actuator, or wiring harness issue.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window motor, door lock actuator, or repairing the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window/lock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Stalling Issues due to Bad Ground Wires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the vehicle may start to stall while driving and/or not start. The cause can be traced back to corrosion that develops on the ground wires.
    *   Solution: Remove the corrosion from the ground wires and replace any damaged wires.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
