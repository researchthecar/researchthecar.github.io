The 2018 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. Available engine options included a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 (170 hp, 203 lb-ft of torque), a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (252 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), and a 1.6L Turbo-Diesel inline-4 (137 hp, 240 lb-ft of torque). All engine options are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, except the 2.0L which is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Equinox for its spacious interior and user-friendly infotainment system, but some common complaints include the base engine feeling underpowered, and the automatic stop/start system being intrusive.
