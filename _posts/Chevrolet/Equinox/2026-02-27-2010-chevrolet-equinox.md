The automatic transmission can also experience problems like harsh shifting and torque converter failures. Suspension components, particularly strut mounts and rear wheel bearings, are also noted for potential issues. Electrical problems, often related to the Body Control Module and infotainment system, can lead to various annoyances. However, the 3.0L V6 engine and exterior components generally fare better. Interior issues are less common, with blend door actuators being a notable exception. Overall, while not without its flaws, addressing these common issues can help maintain the Equinox's functionality.
