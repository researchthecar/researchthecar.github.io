The 2022 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV offering a blend of practicality, comfort, and value. It comes with a single engine option: a 1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Equinox for its spacious cabin, user-friendly infotainment system, and comfortable ride. However, some common dislikes include the somewhat underpowered engine and unremarkable fuel economy compared to competitors.

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail, resulting in a significant loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling), and potentially the check engine light illuminating.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping can manifest as delayed engagement, increased RPMs without a corresponding increase in speed, or difficulty shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution could range from a fluid flush and filter change to a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4000+
