The 2014 Chevrolet Equinox is a popular compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel-efficient engine options. The base engine is a 2.4L inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.6L V6 engine producing 301 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque was also available. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Equinox's ample cargo space and quiet cabin. Common complaints include issues with excessive oil consumption on the 2.4L engine, transmission hesitation, and certain electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**2.4L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report excessive oil consumption, sometimes exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating, engine knocking or ticking sounds, and potentially engine damage if oil levels are not monitored and maintained.
    *   Solution: GM issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) related to piston ring design and oil consumption. The repair typically involves replacing the pistons and piston rings with an updated design. Some owners have reported success with cleaning the piston ring grooves using a chemical treatment, but this is not always a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (for piston replacement)
    *   Recalls: 16V029000

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The high-pressure fuel pump, responsible for delivering fuel directly to the engine's cylinders, can fail. Symptoms include a hard start, rough idling, engine misfires, loss of power, and stalling. A check engine light will typically illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report hard or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. Some experience hesitation when accelerating from a stop or when attempting to pass.
    *   Solution: Some have had success with a transmission fluid flush and/or software update. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $800 - $1,500 (valve body), $3,000 - $5,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter is a fluid coupling which allows the engine to spin somewhat independently of the transmission. If there is a failure, symptoms can include a chattering or shuddering feeling during acceleration, poor fuel economy, stalling at low speeds, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Stabilizer Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report premature wear and failure of the stabilizer bar links, leading to a clunking or rattling noise from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the stabilizer bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Radio/Touchscreen Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can experience various issues, including freezing, lagging, rebooting, and complete failure. Some owners report the touchscreen becoming unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve minor glitches. More severe issues may require replacement of the radio head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (software update), $500 - $1,000+ (radio replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing unexplained battery drain, resulting in the vehicle being unable to start. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Requires diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Repair could involve replacing a faulty module, fixing a wiring issue, or replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch latch mechanism can fail, preventing the hatch from opening or closing properly.
