The 2020 Chevrolet Equinox is a compact SUV offering a blend of practicality and comfort, making it a popular choice for families and commuters. Two engine options were available: a 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Equinox for its spacious interior, user-friendly infotainment system, and comfortable ride. However, some common dislikes include the base engine's lack of power and reported issues with reliability.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 1.5L engine consuming oil at a higher-than-normal rate, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. Blue exhaust smoke may also be present.
    * Solution: Possible solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive work like piston ring replacement. A compression test can help diagnose the severity.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (PCV valve) - $3,000+ (piston ring replacement/engine rebuild).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Purge Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The purge valve can fail, leading to rough idling, difficulty starting, and a check engine light. A common diagnostic trouble code (DTC) associated with this issue is P0496.
    * Solution: Replacement of the purge valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. There may also be a hesitation or delay when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In other cases, it could be related to worn transmission components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (Software update) to $2,000 - $5,000+ (Transmission Repair/Replacement)
