### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier is a budget-conscious vehicle that, while generally functional, exhibits common reliability concerns typical for its class and age. The Ecotec engines are generally robust, but the automatic transmissions, particularly the 4T40-E/4T45-E, are a frequent source of repair. Suspension components and some electrical parts like window regulators and instrument clusters can also require attention. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates. For potential buyers, a thorough pre-purchase inspection focusing on the transmission and checking for rust is highly recommended. With diligent maintenance, it can serve as reliable basic transportation.
