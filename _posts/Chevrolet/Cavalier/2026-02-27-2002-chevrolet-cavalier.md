### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier can be a cost-effective vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The Ecotec engines, while generally robust, can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and oil seal failures. Automatic transmissions may develop shifting problems or torque converter issues. On the manual side, clutch wear is a common concern. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module, can lead to frustrating intermittent problems. Rust can also be a significant issue depending on the vehicle's climate history. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, these recurring issues mean that maintenance and repair costs can add up over time, especially if multiple problems are present.
