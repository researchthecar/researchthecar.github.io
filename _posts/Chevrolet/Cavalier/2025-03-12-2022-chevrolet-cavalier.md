**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and visible exhaust smoke in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection is recommended to check for leaks, piston ring issues, or valve seal problems. In some instances, replacing the piston rings or valve seals may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail prematurely, leading to a check engine light and potentially reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting between gears. This may be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, further diagnosis of the transmission valve body or solenoids may be necessary. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse. This may present as a noticeable pause before the car begins to move.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid level check and inspection for leaks. A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) might address the issue. In some cases, internal transmission damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid check) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
