The 2005 Chevrolet Cavalier was a compact car known for its affordability and simplicity. It came with two engine options: a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often appreciated the Cavalier for its fuel efficiency and easy handling, while some disliked its somewhat basic interior and dated styling. Common criticisms also included a lack of refinement compared to some of its competitors.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold gasket can crack and leak, causing a vacuum leak. This can result in rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light (typically P0171 - System Too Lean).
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gasket with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature catalytic converter failure, often triggered by issues upstream in the engine (like the intake manifold gasket leak). Symptoms include a check engine light (typically P0420 - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold), reduced engine performance, and failing emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter. Addressing the root cause of the failure (e.g., fixing the intake manifold gasket leak) is crucial to prevent future converter issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4T40-E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts between gears, particularly 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd. Slipping during acceleration. These issues can stem from worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush *might* temporarily alleviate the symptoms if the fluid is very old and contaminated. More permanent fixes range from replacing the valve body or solenoids to a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $2000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Noisy steering. Visible cracking or deterioration of the rubber strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front strut mounts. Replacing the struts at the same time is often recommended, as the labor overlaps and struts are wear items.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (including struts)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Ignition Switch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ignition switch can develop electrical problems, causing the engine to stall, the car to not start, or the radio to cut out intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The BCM controls various electrical functions, and problems can manifest in a variety of ways, including malfunctioning power windows, door locks, lights, or other accessories. Intermittent or complete failure of these systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause of the BCM issue (which could be wiring problems or a faulty BCM itself). Repairing the wiring or replacing and reprogramming the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the issue and whether the BCM needs replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exterior door handles, particularly on older Cavaliers, can break or become brittle, making it difficult to open the doors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per handle
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster can experience issues, such as gauges failing to operate correctly or the backlighting going out.
    * Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Chevrolet Cavalier, while generally a reliable and affordable car, has some common issues. The 2.2L engine is susceptible to intake manifold gasket leaks and catalytic converter failures. The 4-speed automatic transmission can suffer from harsh shifting and slipping. Electrical issues with the ignition switch and BCM are also relatively common. Suspension components like the strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Exterior door handles can also fail. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have a mechanic inspect the car before purchasing.
