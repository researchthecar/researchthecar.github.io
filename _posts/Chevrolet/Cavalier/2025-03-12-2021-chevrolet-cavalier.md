This summary relies on available consumer reports and general automotive knowledge.

The 2021 Chevrolet Cavalier is a compact sedan mainly sold in markets like Mexico and China. It's generally praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and simple design. Some common complaints center around its basic features, less refined driving experience compared to more modern vehicles, and limited availability of parts and service in regions where it's not officially sold. The 2021 Cavalier is equipped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 107 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque, usually paired with a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4 (L2B)**

*   **Rough Idling/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may idle roughly, hesitate during acceleration, or stall unexpectedly. This can be intermittent or consistent.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause is key. Potential causes include a dirty throttle body, faulty mass airflow (MAF) sensor, or a vacuum leak. Cleaning the throttle body and/or replacing the MAF sensor are common fixes. Checking for and repairing vacuum leaks is also necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the cause and parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, illuminated check engine light (often with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency), and potential rattling noises from the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Specific Model Number Not Widely Documented, likely a variant of a GM 6TXX)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, especially noticeable during acceleration and deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor cases. More severe cases might require valve body repair or replacement. Software updates may also address shifting issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+ (depending on the severity and required repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can occur during acceleration or when trying to maintain speed uphill.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed to determine the cause of the slippage. Possible causes include low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or a faulty torque converter. Depending on the diagnosis, the fix could range from a fluid top-off to a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (fluid top off) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. The vehicle might also feel less stable during cornering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the specific bushings and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen becomes unresponsive, freezes, or crashes intermittently.
    *   Solution: Software updates, if available, might resolve the issue. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (ABS, TPMS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights illuminating on the dashboard for ABS, TPMS, or other systems. Diagnostic codes will be stored indicating a sensor fault.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per sensor (depending on the sensor and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Chevrolet Cavalier, while offering affordability, may exhibit issues related to engine performance, transmission behavior, suspension wear, and electrical gremlins. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences (like rough shifting) to more significant problems (like catalytic converter failure). The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the parts required, but some repairs could potentially exceed $1000. Limited availability of parts and service in certain regions might add to the overall cost and inconvenience. Due to the limited information, it is recommended to take extra time to inspect the car before purchasing.
