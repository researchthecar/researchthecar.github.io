The 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier was a compact car offered in coupe and sedan body styles. It was known for its affordability and fuel efficiency, making it a popular choice for budget-conscious buyers. It was available with two engine options: a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a less common 2.4L LD9 inline-4 making 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Cavalier's simple design, ease of maintenance, and gas mileage. Common complaints included the car's somewhat bland styling, cheap interior materials, and susceptibility to rust.

**Summary**

The 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier, while affordable and fuel-efficient, suffered from a range of common issues. Engine problems like intake manifold gasket and crankshaft position sensor failures can lead to drivability issues and moderate repair costs. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic, can be more severe and expensive to fix. Suspension issues and electrical problems can contribute to safety concerns and overall reliability. Rust is also a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Overall, while the Cavalier may be an inexpensive car to acquire, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
