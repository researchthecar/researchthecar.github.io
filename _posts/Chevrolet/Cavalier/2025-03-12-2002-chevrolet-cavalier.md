The 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier was a compact car popular for its affordability and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec Inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L LD9 Twin Cam Inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Cavalier's simple design, reliability (for its price point), and decent gas mileage. Common complaints included a somewhat bland driving experience, lower-quality interior materials, and some recurring mechanical issues.
