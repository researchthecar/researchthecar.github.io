### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chevrolet Cavalier is a budget-friendly compact car that, while generally dependable for its segment, exhibits some common issues. Owners frequently report problems with oil and coolant leaks from the Ecotec engines, and the 2.4L engine can experience timing chain wear. Automatic transmissions may develop shifting problems, while manual transmissions are susceptible to clutch wear. Suspension components like ball joints and struts are also common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can occur. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the blower motor and seat fabric can show wear. Despite these potential issues, many Cavaliers provide reliable service with proper maintenance and timely repairs, especially considering their initial purchase price.
