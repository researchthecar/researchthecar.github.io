The 2018 Chevrolet Cavalier, primarily sold in Mexico and other markets outside the US, is a compact sedan that was designed to provide affordable and practical transportation. The engine options included a 1.5L inline-4 engine, producing around 107 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Cavalier's fuel efficiency and simple design. However, some common criticisms include a lack of advanced features and somewhat basic interior quality.

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 1.5L engines consume an excessive amount of oil between oil changes, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution can range from using a thicker oil to replacing piston rings or even the entire engine in severe cases. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. This can be accompanied by a noticeable "clunk" or "thud" sound during gear changes.
    *   Solution: The issue may be due to a faulty valve body, worn transmission fluid, or issues with the transmission control module (TCM). A transmission flush with new fluid and a TCM reprogram might resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the valve body or the entire transmission may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported instances of the infotainment system freezing, crashing, or becoming unresponsive. This can affect access to navigation, audio controls, and other vehicle settings.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a simple reboot of the system (if possible) can resolve the issue. However, a software update from the dealer or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the car battery draining quickly, especially when the vehicle is not in use. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic drain is crucial. Possible causes include faulty door modules, BCM issues, or aftermarket accessories improperly installed. Troubleshooting involves using a multimeter to measure current draw and isolate the circuit responsible.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted that the center console material is prone to cracking, especially around high-use areas like the cupholders or gear shift.
    *   Solution: The console panel can be replaced by a professional. The part can be purchased online.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup or condensation inside the headlight housings. This can reduce visibility and potentially damage the headlight bulbs or electrical components.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the fix could involve replacing the headlight housing or attempting to reseal it. Sometimes, simply removing the bulb cover and allowing the moisture to evaporate can temporarily resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Chevrolet Cavalier, while appreciated for its affordability and fuel efficiency, does exhibit several common issues. Engine-related issues like excessive oil consumption can be costly to repair and are a significant concern. Electrical problems, such as infotainment system malfunctions and battery drain, can be frustrating for owners. While not all Cavaliers will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but addressing them promptly can prevent more extensive damage and ensure the vehicle's long-term reliability.
