### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier is a budget-friendly compact car that generally offers basic transportation. Its reliability is moderate, with common issues often centering around the automatic transmission (specifically the 4T40-E), which can experience slipping or torque converter problems. Engine options, particularly the 2.2L Ecotec and 2.4L Twin Cam, can develop oil leaks or timing chain issues. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM failures and alternator issues, can occur. Exterior rust, especially in harsh climates, and interior wear on seats and HVAC components are also points to consider. While not a paragon of reliability, many Cavaliers provide dependable service if well-maintained, making them a viable option for cost-conscious buyers aware of potential repair needs.
