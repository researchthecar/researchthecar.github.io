### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier is a vehicle that requires careful consideration regarding its reliability. While its smaller engines like the 2.2L Ecotec are generally more robust, the 2.4L Twin Cam can present more significant issues such as timing chain and head gasket problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4T40-E/4T45-E, are prone to slipping and torque converter issues, while manual transmissions are more durable but can suffer from clutch wear. Electrical components like window regulators and alternators are common failure points. Rust can also be a concern on older models. Overall, while the Cavalier can be an economical choice, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs.
