It is paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Cavalier was praised for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and spacious interior, but it was criticized for its lackluster performance, poor handling, and cheap interior materials.

**Engine**

* **2.2L Ecotec**
    * **Timing Chain Failure:** The timing chain can prematurely stretch or break, resulting in loss of engine power. Symptoms include engine noise, rough idling, and reduced performance. The fix involves replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak. Symptoms include rough idling, poor fuel economy, and reduced power. The fix involves replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * **Knock Sensor Failure:** The knock sensor can fail, causing the engine to run poorly and experience reduced power. Symptoms include poor performance, engine knocking, and illuminated check engine light. The fix involves replacing the knock sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Transmission**
