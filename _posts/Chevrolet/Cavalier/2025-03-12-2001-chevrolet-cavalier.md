The 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier was a compact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It was available with two engine options: a 2.2L Inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Cavalier for its low price, simple design, and decent fuel economy. Common complaints included a lack of refinement, cheap interior materials, and a somewhat uninspired driving experience.

**Summary**

The 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier has several common issues. Engine issues, especially with the 2.2L and 2.4L engines (gasket leaks, head cracking, oil consumption, timing chain issues) can be costly to repair. Transmission problems are also prevalent. Suspension and electrical issues are less severe, but still contribute to the overall ownership experience. Rust can be a significant problem, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Overall, the Cavalier can be an inexpensive car to purchase, but potential repair costs should be considered. The severity of repairs can range from minor (door handles, headliner) to major (engine or transmission rebuild/replacement), significantly impacting ownership costs.
