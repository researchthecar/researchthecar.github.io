The 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier was a compact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. Two engine options were available: a 2.2L inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were offered with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Cavalier's gas mileage and simple design, but often disliked its lack of refinement and reliability issues.
