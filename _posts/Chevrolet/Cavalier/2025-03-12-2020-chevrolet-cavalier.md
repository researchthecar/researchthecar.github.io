It comes with a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine producing around 107 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Cavalier's low price point and fuel economy. Common dislikes often include its relatively basic interior, limited features compared to some competitors, and less powerful engine. This analysis focuses on common issues reported by owners and mechanics.

**Engine**

**1.5L Inline-4 L2B**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls unexpectedly, especially at idle or low speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Inspect and clean the throttle body. Check for vacuum leaks. A software update to the engine control unit (ECU) may be available to address the stalling issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report needing to add oil frequently between oil changes. Visible blue smoke may come from the exhaust, indicating oil burning.
    *   Solution: Inspect for leaks around valve cover gaskets and the oil pan. A compression test can help determine if piston rings are worn. Replacing piston rings or the entire engine may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or harsh shifts between gears, especially from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission fluid flush may help. In some cases, the valve body within the transmission may need to be replaced or rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive or Reverse.
    *   Solution: Inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is dark or has a burnt smell, a transmission flush and filter change are recommended. If the issue persists, internal transmission damage may be present, requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of shocks, struts, and bushings, leading to a bouncy ride and clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Replace worn shocks, struts, and bushings as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the system. Check for software updates. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not in use.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested. Check for parasitic draws by disconnecting components one by one and testing with a multimeter. A faulty alternator can also cause battery drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appear on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Use a dashboard protectant. In severe cases, replace the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Chevrolet Cavalier, while an affordable and fuel-efficient option, has some reported issues. Engine stalling and excessive oil consumption are notable engine concerns. The 6-speed automatic transmission can suffer from rough shifting. Dashboard cracking is a possible interior issue.
