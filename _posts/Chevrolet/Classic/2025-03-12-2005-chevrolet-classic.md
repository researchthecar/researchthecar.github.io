The 2005 Chevrolet Classic, a rebadged Chevrolet Malibu, was offered with only one engine option: a 2.2-liter Ecotec inline-4 engine producing 144 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Classic for its reliability, fuel economy, and affordable price point. Common dislikes centered around its somewhat bland styling, basic interior features, and handling characteristics.

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail prematurely, leading to the check engine light illuminating with codes related to catalyst inefficiency. The vehicle may also fail emissions testing. Symptoms can include a sulfur smell from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oxygen sensors can fail, leading to the check engine light illuminating. This can cause poor fuel economy, rough idling, and potential engine misfires. Diagnostic codes related to oxygen sensor performance will be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances. Clunking noises over bumps are also a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Chevrolet Classic is generally a reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues like catalytic converter and oxygen sensor failures can be relatively inexpensive to address. Transmission problems, while less frequent, can be more costly to repair. Suspension wear and electrical issues like power windows are also common concerns. Exterior rust, particularly in colder climates, is a potential problem. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more significant repairs. The estimated cost to fix these issues can vary significantly depending on the specific problem and the repair shop used.
