**Engine**

**5.7L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks. Some have needed to replace valve cover gaskets or piston rings in more extreme cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and the needed repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.2L Duramax Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent or incomplete DPF regeneration cycles, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and potential damage to the DPF system. Error codes related to the DPF system may be present.
    *   Solution: Ensuring proper driving habits to facilitate regeneration (highway driving at sustained speeds), replacing faulty sensors, or cleaning/replacing the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+ (depending on the needed repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found
