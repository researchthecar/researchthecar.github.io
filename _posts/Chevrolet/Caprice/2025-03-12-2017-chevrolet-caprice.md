The 2017 Chevrolet Caprice PPV (Police Pursuit Vehicle) is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan primarily designed for law enforcement use. It's essentially a rebadged Holden Caprice from Australia, and it wasn't sold to the general public in the US. The 2017 model is powered by a 6.0L LS-series V8 engine producing approximately 355 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 6L80E 6-speed automatic transmission. People often like the Caprice PPV for its powerful engine, spacious interior, and robust build quality. Downsides often cited are the spartan interior, limited availability of parts, and the fact that it was never intended for civilian use.

**Engine**

**6.0L LS V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage due to collapsed lifters. Often accompanied by a check engine light with codes related to cylinder misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters, potentially including the entire set. Some owners opt to delete the AFM system altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of damage and chosen repair strategy.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: The fix can vary, from replacing the PCV valve, to installing a catch can to catch oil mist, to replacing valve stem seals, to replacing piston rings in extreme cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the issue and the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the transmission, which may involve replacing solenoids, valve body, or complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ depending on the cause of the issue and repair required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**

    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shocks and springs. Some owners opt for heavy-duty replacements or air-assisted shocks to improve load carrying capability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking, popping, or creaking noises when turning or going over bumps, indicating worn or failed strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery keeps draining even when the vehicle is off, resulting in difficulty starting or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by aftermarket police equipment.
    *   Solution: Thorough diagnosis of the electrical system to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Disconnecting aftermarket police equipment may be a solution to identify the source. Replacing the battery can be a possible solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on complexity of problem
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failure**

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Caprice PPV is generally considered a reliable vehicle thanks to its robust drivetrain. However, potential buyers should be aware of potential issues such as AFM lifter failure, and the transmission's tendency to develop harsh shifting. The battery drain issue from aftermarket police equipment can be problematic. The cost of these repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls.
