The 2015 Chevrolet Caprice PPV (Police Patrol Vehicle) is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan built on the Holden WM/WN platform. It was primarily sold to law enforcement agencies and fleet customers in the United States. The Caprice PPV was available with two engine options: a 3.6L LFX V6 producing 301 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0L L77 V8 producing 355 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6L80E six-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Caprice for its spacious interior, powerful V8 engine option, and robust build quality. Common complaints include limited availability to the general public, basic interior features (due to its police vehicle origins), and potential maintenance costs associated with a performance-oriented vehicle.

**Engine**

**3.6L LFX V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit a rattling noise, particularly on startup. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to camshaft timing may be present. Reduced engine performance and potential for engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners. Inspection of the camshaft sprockets is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Long crank times, stalling, or a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replace the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L L77 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, particularly on cylinders 1, 4, 6, or 7. Ticking or knocking noises from the engine. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to cylinder misfires and/or AFM system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected AFM lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners opt for an AFM delete kit, which replaces the AFM lifters with standard lifters and disables the AFM system via tuning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4500+ (depending on AFM delete or full replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warnings. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust. Fouled spark plugs.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV system can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the extent of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80E Six-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during light acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Transmission slipping. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to torque converter clutch (TCC).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Flushing the transmission fluid and inspecting for debris is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or delayed shifts. Slipping between gears. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to transmission solenoids or internal components.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by wear on the valve body, the 1-2-3-4 clutch, or the 4-5-6 clutch. Replacing the transmission fluid and filter can sometimes resolve minor issues. Valve body replacement or full transmission rebuild may be necessary in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $4500+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits noticeably lower than the front. This can lead to reduced handling performance and increased wear on the rear tires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs may be beneficial, especially if the vehicle is frequently loaded with cargo.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise when driving over bumps. Reduced handling performance and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts, along with the struts if needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days of sitting. Difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic drain. This could involve testing various circuits and components to isolate the fault. Possible culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing body control module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (simple fix) - $1000+ (complex diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent loss of sound, system freezing, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the radio unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Caprice PPV, while generally a reliable vehicle, has a few common problem areas. The 6.0L L77 V8 is prone to AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, which can be expensive to repair. The 6L80E transmission may experience torque converter issues and harsh shifting. Electrical issues and suspension problems are also potential concerns. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for potential repairs. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely depending on the vehicle's history, maintenance, and driving conditions.
