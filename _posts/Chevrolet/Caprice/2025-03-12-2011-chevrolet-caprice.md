The 2011 Chevrolet Caprice is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan primarily sold to law enforcement and fleet customers in the United States. It was based on the Australian-built Holden WM/WN Caprice. The 2011 model year Caprice PPV (Police Patrol Vehicle) was equipped with a 6.0L L77 V8 engine producing approximately 355 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission was a 6L80 six-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Caprice for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and robust build quality. However, some disliked its relatively plain interior, limited availability to the general public, and fuel economy. Some civilian models were later sold on the used market, making them desirable for their performance and spaciousness.

**Engine**

**6.0L L77 V8**

*   **AFM (Active Fuel Management) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system is designed to shut down cylinders to improve fuel economy. The lifters on the cylinders that shut down can collapse, causing a misfire, rough running, and a ticking noise. This can also lead to camshaft damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Many owners choose to delete the AFM system entirely by installing a non-AFM camshaft and lifters, and reprogram the ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether AFM is deleted)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some L77 engines in the Caprice PPV can exhibit excessive oil consumption, especially at higher mileage. This can be due to piston ring issues or valve seal problems.
    *   Solution: Perform an oil consumption test to determine the severity. Depending on the source of the problem, solutions range from replacing valve seals to replacing piston rings or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the fix)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 Six-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement, particularly after the transmission has warmed up. This can be due to wear in the valve body, solenoids, or internal clutches.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In more severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt at low speeds or during light acceleration can indicate a torque converter issue. This can be due to worn clutch material inside the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's often recommended to flush the transmission and replace the filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear shock absorbers can wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially when loaded.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (for parts and labor, depending on the brand of shocks)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A clunking or popping noise from the front suspension, particularly when turning or going over bumps, can indicate worn strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts and potentially the struts themselves, depending on their condition.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (for parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery can drain overnight or over a few days of inactivity, leading to difficulty starting the car. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, the radio, or a failing body control module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster may experience intermittent failures, such as flickering lights, inaccurate readings, or complete loss of functionality.
    *   Solution: The instrument cluster may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear windows may fail to operate properly, either moving slowly, stopping partway, or not moving at all. This is often due to a failed window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (per window)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC system may blow hot air on one side and cold air on the other, or the temperature control may not work correctly. This is often caused by a failed blend door actuator. A clicking or whirring noise behind the dashboard may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Chevrolet Caprice PPV, while generally a robust vehicle, has a few common issues, particularly related to the engine's AFM system and the transmission. The AFM lifter failure can be a significant expense if not addressed promptly. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and instrument cluster problems, can also occur. The suspension and HVAC systems are prone to certain failures as well, though usually these are relatively inexpensive to repair. Overall, while owning a Caprice PPV can be rewarding due to its performance and spaciousness, it's crucial to be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly for repairs.
