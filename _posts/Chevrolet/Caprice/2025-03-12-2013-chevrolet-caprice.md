Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2013 Chevrolet Caprice, categorized by system, engine, and transmission options. The 2013 Chevrolet Caprice was primarily sold as a police vehicle (PPV) in the US. It came standard with a 6.0L L77 V8 engine producing 355 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque and was paired with a 6L80E six-speed automatic transmission. Some people appreciate the Caprice PPV for its robust mechanicals, spacious interior, and strong performance. Common dislikes include its utilitarian interior, limited availability to the general public, and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**6.0L L77 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, "Check Engine" light illumination. Often caused by collapsed AFM lifters due to oil starvation or mechanical failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of all lifters (including non-AFM lifters) is recommended, along with inspection and potential replacement of the camshaft. Consider disabling AFM system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. May be related to PCV system issues or piston ring issues.
    * Solution: Diagnose cause of oil consumption (PCV, piston rings). Replace faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts between gears, slipping during acceleration, erratic shifting behavior.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the issue. May require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5000+ (depending on issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive rear-end bounce, instability during cornering, premature tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise from the wheels, especially at higher speeds, excessive wheel play.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery frequently dying, requiring jump starts. Could be due to parasitic drain from aftermarket equipment, faulty BCM, or other electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic drain using a multimeter and electrical schematics. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminated on the dashboard, malfunctioning ABS system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose which ABS sensor is failing using a scan tool. Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Removal and drying of headlight assembly, resealing of headlight housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300 per headlight (DIY resealing is cheaper than replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Chevrolet Caprice, primarily the PPV model, can suffer from several issues. The most concerning are potential engine problems related to AFM lifter failure, which can be expensive to repair. Oil consumption issues also can be a problem, as can harsh shifting from the transmission. Suspension and electrical problems are also possible. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems.
