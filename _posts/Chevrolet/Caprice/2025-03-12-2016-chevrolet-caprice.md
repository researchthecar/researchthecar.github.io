The 2016 Chevrolet Caprice PPV (Police Patrol Vehicle) is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan based on the Holden WM/WN Caprice. It was primarily sold to law enforcement agencies, but some were available to the public. The Caprice PPV only came with one engine option: the 6.0L L77 V8 engine producing 355 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6L80E 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners and enthusiasts appreciate the Caprice PPV for its robust powertrain, spacious interior, and strong performance capabilities. Some common dislikes include the spartan interior (designed for police use), limited availability of parts compared to other GM vehicles, and the potential for higher mileage and wear due to its service as a police vehicle.

**Engine**

**6.0L L77 V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between changes. This can be more prevalent in vehicles that have seen extended idling time, a common occurrence in police service.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. Switching to a different oil viscosity might help in some cases, but engine wear or faulty PCV valve are also potential causes that may need to be addressed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the cause and solution - PCV valve replacement is on the lower end, while engine work is significantly more expensive)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The L77 engine utilizes Active Fuel Management (AFM), which deactivates four cylinders under light load to improve fuel economy. This system can sometimes cause issues, including lifter failure, rough running, and oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Some owners choose to disable the AFM system using aftermarket devices or tuning. Others replace the AFM lifters with standard lifters to permanently remove the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the solution and extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes resolve minor issues. More serious cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or even a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+ (depending on the solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension, especially on high-mileage vehicles, can sag, leading to a lower ride height and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear springs and/or shocks. Upgrading to heavy-duty springs can help prevent future sagging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws by testing the current draw on various circuits when the vehicle is off. A faulty alternator, a malfunctioning module, or aftermarket accessories can cause excessive drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Interior Lighting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with interior lights, such as dome lights or map lights, malfunctioning or failing to operate.
    *   Solution: Replacing bulbs is the first step. If the issue persists, inspect the associated wiring and connectors for damage or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Fading/Yellowing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic headlight lenses can become cloudy or yellowed over time, reducing headlight output and visibility.
    *   Solution: Headlight restoration kits can be used to polish and clear the lenses. Alternatively, the headlights can be replaced entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Upholstery Wear (Specifically Cloth)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cloth upholstery used in the Caprice PPV can be prone to wear and tear, particularly on the driver's seat.
    *   Solution: Seat covers or reupholstering the seats are common solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Center Console Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The center console, especially around the shifter area, can be susceptible to damage or cracking, particularly in vehicles that have seen heavy use.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the damaged parts of the center console.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Chevrolet Caprice PPV, while a capable and reliable vehicle, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine (oil consumption, AFM issues) and transmission (harsh shifting). Suspension sagging and electrical problems like battery drain also appear. The cost to repair these issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing bulbs or performing fluid changes to more costly repairs involving engine or transmission work. Potential buyers should carefully inspect vehicles for these issues, especially given their typical history of use as police vehicles.
