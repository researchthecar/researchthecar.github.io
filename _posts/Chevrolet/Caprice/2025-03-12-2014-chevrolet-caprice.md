The main engine option is the 6.0L L77 V8 engine rated at 355 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. Some like the Caprice for its spacious interior, robust drivetrain, and potential for performance upgrades. Dislikes often center around its utilitarian interior, limited availability to the general public, and sometimes challenging maintenance due to its fleet-oriented design. The standard transmission is a 6L80E six-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Caprice, while generally a robust vehicle, does have some common problem areas. The most significant concern is the potential for AFM lifter failure in the 6.0L V8, which can be costly to repair. Other engine-related issues like oil consumption and knock sensor failure can also arise. The 6L80E transmission can experience harsh shifting and torque converter issues. Electrical problems like battery drain and sensor failures are also relatively common. While suspension issues can occur, they are generally less severe. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchase decision.
