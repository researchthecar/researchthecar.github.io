### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Chevrolet Caprice, particularly in its PPV configuration, is generally a reliable vehicle built for demanding use. The 6.0L V8 engine, while powerful, can be susceptible to oil cooler line leaks and issues with the Active Fuel Management system, which can lead to costly repairs. The 6-speed automatic transmission is also a point of concern, with reports of torque converter shudder and shifting problems. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, can occur but are typically manageable. The suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread issues, reflecting the vehicle's robust construction. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of the aforementioned issues are crucial for maintaining the Caprice's long-term reliability.
