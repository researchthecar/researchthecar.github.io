The 2019 Chevrolet LCF 4500 is a medium-duty cab-over truck designed for commercial use. It offers maneuverability in urban environments and good visibility. The 2019 LCF 4500 came with one engine option: a 5.2L inline-4 Isuzu diesel engine producing 215 horsepower and 452 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with an Aisin A465 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often appreciate the truck's tight turning radius and ease of maintenance. Common dislikes include the relatively spartan interior and somewhat limited power compared to larger V8 diesel options found in conventional trucks.
