The 2017 Chevrolet LCF 4500 is a low cab forward (LCF) truck designed for commercial applications. Engine options include the 5.7L Vortec V8 gasoline engine and the 5.2L 4HK1-TC diesel engine. The 5.2L diesel produced approximately 215 horsepower and 452 lb-ft of torque. It is important to note that most LCF 4500 trucks are upfitted with specialized bodies, so the opinions on the cab and chassis alone can be limited. Some owners like the maneuverability and visibility afforded by the LCF design, while others find the cab cramped and the ride harsh. General dislikes include the limited engine power for heavier loads and the sometimes difficult access to certain engine components for maintenance.

**Engine**

**5.2L 4HK1-TC Diesel**

*   **DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Regeneration Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, incomplete regeneration, "Check Engine" light illumination, reduced engine power, and potential for DPF clogging. This can be caused by excessive idling, short trips, or a faulty regeneration system.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (performed by a technician), replacement of the DPF, or addressing underlying issues causing excessive soot production (e.g., faulty injectors).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, poor fuel economy, and "Check Engine" light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level, and visible oil leaks from valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+ depending on the location and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin A465 6-speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. This can also be caused by low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid change and filter replacement, or replacement of faulty solenoids. In severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable vibration or shudder, especially at lower speeds or during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush with a friction modifier additive, or torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the truck sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded. Also, visible cracks on the leaf spring.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaf spring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, sensors malfunctioning, or difficulty starting. This can be due to damaged or corroded wiring connectors, particularly in areas exposed to the elements.
    *   Solution: Inspection and repair/replacement of damaged wiring harnesses and connectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around the body panels, wheel wells, and frame, particularly in areas exposed to road salt or moisture.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or replacement of affected panels. Application of rust inhibitors and protective coatings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor not functioning, resulting in no air circulation in the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet LCF 4500 presents a range of potential issues, varying in severity and cost. The most significant problems revolve around the diesel engine, particularly the DPF system, which can be expensive to repair if neglected. Fuel injector problems can also be fairly expensive. The Aisin transmission can be a source of issues, but these are typically less severe than major engine repairs. Suspension issues, electrical problems, and rust are all common issues that can lead to more expensive repairs if left alone. Buyers should pay close attention to the engine condition, maintenance records, and any signs of excessive wear or rust.
