**Engine**

**6.6L Duramax Diesel V8 (L5D)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, excessive smoke (white or black), reduced power, and potentially a check engine light with codes related to fuel injector performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using a scan tool to identify the faulty injector(s). Replacement of the failed fuel injector(s) and recalibration of the engine control module (ECM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ per injector (depending on location and labor rates).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, "Reduced Engine Power" message, check engine light, potential for engine damage due to excessive backpressure. Can be caused by faulty sensors, short trips, or other engine issues.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (if possible), replacement of faulty sensors (differential pressure sensor, temperature sensors), addressing underlying engine issues causing excessive soot. In severe cases, DPF replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Sensor replacement $200 - $500, Forced Regen $150 - $300, DPF Replacement $2000 - $5000+ (depending on aftermarket or OEM).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 1000 Series 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, failure to engage gears, transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the transmission, including checking fluid level and condition. Could require valve body replacement/rebuild, torque converter replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change $150-$300, valve body repair/replacement $800-$2000, transmission rebuild/replacement $3000 - $7000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, primarily at lower speeds or during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Transmission flush with updated fluid, torque converter replacement (if shudder persists), or potentially a complete transmission rebuild in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Flush $150-$300, torque converter replacement $1000-$2500, rebuild depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, reduced ride height, rough ride, potential for cracking or breaking of leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn or damaged leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring (depending on aftermarket or OEM and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, increased stopping distance, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn shocks/struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per axle (depending on quality and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting, need for frequent jump starts. Can be caused by parasitic draw from aftermarket accessories, faulty modules, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Repair or replacement of faulty components. Battery testing and replacement if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue and parts needed. Battery replacement $200 - $400.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS, Wheel Speed, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard (ABS, traction control, etc.), reduced functionality of systems, potential for safety issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using a scan tool to identify the faulty sensor(s). Replacement of the failed sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per sensor (depending on location and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion on Frame/Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts, especially in areas with high salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and application of rust-inhibiting coatings. In severe cases, welding repairs or frame replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Rust proofing $500 - $1500, welding repairs depending on severity. Frame replacement can be very expensive $5000-$10,000+
