The 2017 Chevrolet LCF 5500XD is a medium-duty cab-over truck designed for various commercial applications. It stands out for its maneuverability and ease of access in urban environments. Engine options included a 5.7L V8 gasoline engine and a 5.2L 4HK1-TC turbodiesel engine. The 5.2L turbodiesel produced 215 horsepower and 452 lb-ft of torque. The Aisin A465 six-speed automatic transmission was the sole transmission option. Owners generally appreciate the truck's visibility, tight turning radius, and fuel efficiency (for a medium-duty truck). Common dislikes often revolve around the somewhat cramped cab, and the ride quality, which is typical of a commercial vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet LCF 5500XD, while a capable work truck, has its share of potential issues. The diesel engine is prone to emissions-related problems (DPF, EGR), while the gasoline engine may experience oil consumption.
