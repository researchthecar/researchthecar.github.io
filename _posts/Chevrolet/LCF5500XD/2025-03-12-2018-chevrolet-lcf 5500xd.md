The 2018 Chevrolet LCF 5500XD is a cab-over truck designed for commercial use, prioritizing maneuverability and visibility in urban environments. It's available with either a 5.7L V8 gasoline engine producing 297 horsepower and 372 lb-ft of torque, or a 5.2L Duramax diesel engine producing 260 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with an Allison 1000 Series automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the truck's compact design and ease of parking, making it well-suited for city deliveries and tight spaces. Some downsides mentioned include the cab's spartan interior and ride quality.
