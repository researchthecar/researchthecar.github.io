The 2017 Chevrolet LCF 3500 is a low cab forward truck designed for commercial applications, offering a maneuverable platform for various upfits. One of the available engine options is the 6.0L V8 gasoline engine which produces 297 horsepower and 372 lb-ft of torque. Another engine option is the 5.2L four cylinder diesel, which is the more common engine option and produces 215 horsepower and 452 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the truck's tight turning radius and ease of entry/exit, making it suitable for urban delivery routes. However, some common complaints include the cab's spartan interior, limited legroom, and some reported issues with reliability. The LCF offers practicality and functionality over luxury.

**Engine**

**6.0L V8 Gasoline**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potential engine knocking.
    *   Solution: The PCV valve may need to be replaced. In more severe cases, piston rings or valve seals may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $250 for PCV valve replacement. $2,000 - $5,000+ for more extensive engine repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, hesitation, and the check engine light illuminating. The issue could be related to faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the specific component causing the misfire. Replacement of the affected ignition coil, spark plug, or fuel injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per ignition coil/spark plug replacement. $200 - $500 per fuel injector replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.2L Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, reduced engine power, and the "check engine" light activating. Can result from short trips where the DPF doesn't reach operating temperature.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration using a diagnostic scan tool. Replacement of the DPF if it becomes clogged or damaged beyond repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for forced regeneration. $1,500 - $3,000+ for DPF replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, black smoke from the exhaust, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). Requires proper diagnosis to identify the affected injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector.

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed gear changes, the transmission slipping out of gear, or a general lack of smooth operation.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor issues. Valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild might be necessary for more severe problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush and filter change. $800 - $1500 for valve body replacement. $3,000 - $6,000+ for a full transmission rebuild or replacement.

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet LCF 3500 presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the diesel models concerning the DPF and fuel injectors, can lead to significant expenses. The Allison transmission, while generally robust, may encounter issues like harsh shifting, requiring costly repairs or rebuilds. Suspension and electrical problems also contribute to the potential for moderate to high repair costs. Overall, buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any LCF 3500 before purchasing.
