**Engine**

**6.0L V8 Gas**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. May be accompanied by blue exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from replacing valve seals to piston rings or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.2L Duramax Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, leading to reduced fuel economy. Potential for DPF clogging and associated warning lights.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration, cleaning of the DPF, or replacement of the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting in cold weather, rough idling, and engine misfires. Check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty glow plugs and inspecting the glow plug control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.0L Gas)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to determine if the valve body, solenoids, or the transmission itself needs replacement. Fluid changes can help but typically is a symptom and not a fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change)- $4000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Aisin 6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 5.2L Diesel)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially when loaded. Reduced ride height and potential for bottoming out.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs or adding helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure and difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after periods of inactivity.
