The 2023 Chevrolet LCF 3500 is a cab-over truck designed for commercial use, offering maneuverability and visibility in urban environments. While many owners appreciate its practicality and work-ready design, some common criticisms include a rough ride, limited cab space, and utilitarian interior. The standard engine is a Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8 producing 350 horsepower and 700 lb-ft of torque, paired with an Allison 1000 Series 6-speed automatic transmission. While a 6.0L V8 gas engine with 297 horsepower and 372 lb-ft of torque paired with a 6L90 6-speed automatic transmission is an available option.
