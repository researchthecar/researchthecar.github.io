**Summary:**

The 2002 Chevrolet C3500HD, while a capable truck, is prone to several issues given its age. Engine problems like fuel injector failure (especially on the Duramax LB7) and intake manifold gasket leaks on the 6.0L V8 can be costly. The 4L80E transmission can experience harsh shifting and slipping issues, leading to potential rebuilds. Suspension components such as ball joints and leaf springs are also common failure points. Rust is a major concern on the exterior, and interior components like the dashboard and headliner can degrade over time. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with potential costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousands, particularly for engine or transmission work. The Duramax diesel version is particularly susceptible to expensive fuel injector failures.
