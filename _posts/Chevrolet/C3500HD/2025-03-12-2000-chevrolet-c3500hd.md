The 2000 Chevrolet C3500HD is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse reputation. Available engine options include the 5.7L Vortec V8, the 7.4L Vortec V8, and the 6.5L Turbo Diesel V8. The 5.7L engine produces around 255 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options primarily consist of the 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission and a five-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the truck's hauling and towing capacity, as well as its relatively simple and durable construction. Common dislikes include the fuel economy of the gasoline engines, the age-related wear and tear on components, and the sometimes rough ride quality, especially when unloaded.
