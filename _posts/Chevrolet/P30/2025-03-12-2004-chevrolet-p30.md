The 2004 Chevrolet P30 is a popular chassis used extensively for various applications, including motorhomes, delivery vans, and work trucks. It's known for its robust build and utilitarian design, prioritizing functionality over luxury. Common engine choices included the 5.7L Vortec V8 (rated around 255 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque) and the 7.4L Vortec V8 (rated around 290 horsepower and 410 lb-ft of torque). A 4.3L V6 was also available. These were typically paired with a 4L80E automatic transmission. Many appreciate the P30's durability and relatively simple mechanics, making it easier to maintain compared to modern vehicles. However, its age means finding parts can sometimes be a challenge, and fuel economy is not a strong suit. Users often comment on the basic interior features and rough ride quality, inherent to its truck-based design.

**Summary**

The 2004 Chevrolet P30, while generally robust, is prone to issues common in vehicles of its age. Engine problems like intake manifold leaks and fuel injector failures are prevalent, especially on the 5.7L V8. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L80E, can be costly. Suspension wear, rust, and electrical glitches are also frequent concerns. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major engine, transmission, or rust remediation can quickly escalate costs. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, paying close attention to these common problem areas, and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
