**Summary**

The 2002 Chevrolet P30, while a durable and capable workhorse, has several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues like intake manifold leaks and spider injector failures in the 5.7L, along with exhaust manifold cracking in the 7.4L, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems with the 4L80E, such as harsh shifting or torque converter failure, are also significant concerns. Suspension and electrical issues, although less severe, can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Depending on the severity and if you choose to repair all the issues, you can potentially expect to pay anywhere between $500 and $10,000+ to repair everything. Therefore, a thorough inspection and understanding of the P30's maintenance history are crucial before purchasing one.
