Engine issues such as exhaust manifold cracks and oil leaks are frequent, along with transmission problems like harsh shifting or torque converter failure with the 4L80E transmission. Suspension wear, particularly leaf springs and ball joints, is also common. Electrical problems, such as fuel pump failures and wiring harness issues can occur. Rust is a prevalent issue on the exterior, and dashboard cracks are common in the interior. While some of these repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission overhauls or extensive rust repair, can be costly.
