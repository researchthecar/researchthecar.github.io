The 2005 Chevrolet P30 is a popular chassis used primarily for step vans and delivery trucks, often utilized by companies like FedEx and UPS. The most common engine options for this model year were the 5.7L V8 and the 6.0L V8. The 5.7L V8 engine produced around 255 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, while the 6.0L V8 bumped that up to around 300 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the P30's robust and utilitarian design, its relatively simple mechanicals which make it easier to repair compared to newer vehicles, and its versatility for customization into various work trucks or even recreational vehicles. However, owners often dislike the P30's fuel economy, its rough ride quality, and the lack of modern comfort and safety features.
