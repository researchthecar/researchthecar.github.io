The 2001 Chevrolet P30 is a popular chassis used for various applications, most commonly as a delivery van or step van, and recreational vehicles (RVs). The P30 is favored for its robust construction and straightforward mechanical design, making it relatively easy to maintain and repair. Engine options for the 2001 P30 include the 5.7L (350 cu in) V8 engine which produced approximately 255 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, and the 7.4L (454 cu in) V8. Transmission options were typically the 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the P30's reliability and its suitability for heavy-duty work. Common dislikes include its relatively poor fuel economy and somewhat dated interior design.
