The 2007 Chevrolet T8500 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial use, offering a range of configurations to suit various applications. Engine options included the Duramax diesel engines and various gasoline options. While specific horsepower and torque figures vary based on the exact engine, Duramax diesels in this era generally produced between 300-330 horsepower and 520-650 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the T8500 for its robust build, payload capacity, and suitability for heavy-duty work. However, common complaints include higher maintenance costs due to its commercial nature, fuel consumption, and the general wear and tear associated with work trucks.

**Engine**

**Duramax Diesel (Specific engine code will vary based on GVWR)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, excessive smoke (black or white), decreased fuel economy, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors. Diagnosis is crucial to determine if one or multiple injectors are failing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, engine overheating, and potential for hydrolock if coolant enters the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler. Thorough cleaning of the EGR valve and intake manifold is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Gasoline Engine (Specific engine code will vary based on GVWR)**
No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Allison Transmission (Specific model will vary based on engine and GVWR)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping between gears, overheating, and eventual loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Inspection of the transmission fluid for debris is essential to determine the extent of damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, failure to shift into certain gears, and transmission fault codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty shift solenoids. Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement are often performed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging, especially when loaded, reduced ride quality, and visible cracks or breaks in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs may be recommended for trucks frequently carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, clunking noises from the front end, uneven tire wear, and difficulty maintaining alignment.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and tie rod ends. A wheel alignment is necessary after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side, including labor and alignment.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, including malfunctioning lights, sensors, and accessories. Often found in areas exposed to road salt and moisture.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of corroded wiring harnesses. Cleaning and protecting connections with dielectric grease can help prevent future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the extent of damage and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning lights, power windows, door locks, and other electrical accessories. Diagnostic codes may indicate a BCM issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the BCM. Programming the new BCM to match the vehicle's configuration is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Cab Corners and Rocker Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust bubbling or holes on the lower cab corners and rocker panels, especially in areas where road salt is used.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or replacement of affected panels. Proper surface preparation and painting are essential to prevent future rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the extent of damage and the quality of repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the temperature of the air blowing from the vents, with either only hot or cold air being produced. Clicking noises from behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Chevrolet T8500, while a capable work truck, faces common issues related to its diesel engines (fuel injectors, EGR cooler), Allison transmission (torque converter, shift solenoids), suspension (leaf springs, ball joints), and electrical system (wiring corrosion, BCM). Body rust can also be a concern, particularly in regions with harsh winter conditions. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but repairs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic familiar with medium-duty trucks.
