### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Chevrolet T8500 is a capable commercial vehicle, but like many trucks in its class, it requires diligent maintenance. The Duramax and Vortec engines, while powerful, can experience issues with fuel injectors, EGR coolers, and intake manifold gaskets, respectively. Transmission reliability is generally good with the Allison 1000, though torque converter and valve body issues can arise. Suspension components like leaf springs and steering parts are subject to wear due to heavy use. Electrical systems can be prone to alternator failures and wiring corrosion. Exterior rust is a common concern for older trucks, particularly in challenging climates. Interior wear on high-use items like the driver's seat and HVAC blower motor are also noted. Proactive inspection and addressing these potential issues can significantly extend the service life of the T8500.
