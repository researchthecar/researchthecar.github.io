The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTD is essentially the refreshed 2019-2021 Silverado 1500 sold alongside the redesigned 2022 Silverado 1500. The "LTD" designation helps differentiate it. This generation Silverado is known for its spacious cabin, comfortable ride (depending on configuration), and strong towing capabilities. Common dislikes include the relatively basic interior design (compared to competitors), and some initial quality concerns. The 2022 Silverado 1500 LTD offered several engine options, including a 2.7L Turbo I4 (310 hp, 430 lb-ft of torque), a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 (355 hp, 383 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were primarily the 8-speed automatic (with the 5.3L V8 on some trims) and the 10-speed automatic.
