### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Chevrolet Cruze presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline engines, particularly the 1.4L turbo, have reported issues with cooling systems and turbochargers. The 2.0L diesel engine is more prone to DPF and EGR problems, common in diesel vehicles. Automatic transmissions can experience shifting issues. Electrical gremlins like instrument cluster failures and battery drains are also noted. However, the manual transmissions and exterior components generally fare better. Interior issues like HVAC blower motor failures and sunroof drain clogs are not uncommon. Owners should be aware of these potential problem areas and ensure proper maintenance, especially for the diesel variants and automatic transmissions.
