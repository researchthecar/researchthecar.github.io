The 2015 Chevrolet Cruze is a compact car known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 1.8L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Cruze's stylish interior and good fuel economy, but some common complaints include electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system, and some engine-related problems, especially with the PCV system on the 1.4L turbo engine.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **PCV System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue is the failure of the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) system. This can manifest as a whistling noise coming from the engine, rough idling, oil leaks, or even a check engine light. The PCV system is prone to clogging, leading to excessive crankcase pressure and potential damage to seals and hoses.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty PCV valve or the entire valve cover assembly, which often includes the PCV valve, is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on whether the entire valve cover needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a known problem with the 1.4L turbo engine. These leaks can occur from various locations, including the water outlet, water pump, or hoses. Symptoms include a low coolant level warning, overheating, or visible coolant under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking component, such as the water outlet or a damaged hose.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the location of the leak and the component being replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting, hesitation, or slipping between gears with the 6-speed automatic transmission. This can be more pronounced during acceleration or when shifting between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and potentially replacing the transmission filter can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 for fluid flush, $500 - $1500+ for valve body repair/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that front struts and rear shocks wear out more quickly than expected. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, excessive body roll when cornering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the parts used and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system is prone to glitches, including freezing, slow response times, and connectivity problems with Bluetooth or USB devices.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve minor glitches. However, in some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200+ for software updates; $400 - $1000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the car battery draining prematurely, particularly if the vehicle is not driven regularly.
    *   Solution: Ensuring all electrical accessories are turned off when the car is not in use. Checking for parasitic drains (electrical components drawing power when the car is off). In some cases, replacing the battery or alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for a new battery; $200-$500+ for alternator replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation can build up inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlight assembly and drying out the condensation. Ensuring the seals are properly installed. In some cases, replacing the headlight assembly may be necessary if the seals are damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100+ for drying/resealing; $200 - $500+ for headlight assembly replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters can fail, often due to a broken heating element in the seat cushion or backrest.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty heating element or the entire seat cushion/backrest.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Cruze, particularly with the 1.4L turbocharged engine, faces several potential issues that buyers should be aware of. Engine-related problems, such as PCV system failures and coolant leaks, can be costly to repair. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain can also be frustrating. While the Cruze offers good fuel economy and a comfortable ride, these potential issues suggest that a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used model. The severity and cost of repairs range from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive engine or transmission work.
