Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 Chevrolet Cruze, categorized by major component.

The 2014 Chevrolet Cruze is a compact sedan that was praised for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and relatively stylish interior.  However, it also received criticism for its somewhat sluggish acceleration and some reliability concerns. The 2014 Cruze came with a few engine and transmission options. The most common engine was the 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder, producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Also available was a 2.0L Turbo Diesel engine which produced 151 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque. The 1.4L engine was typically paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0L diesel engine was only available with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling or whining sound from the engine bay, check engine light. Often related to oil starvation due to other issues (see below).
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.  Inspect and address any oil leaks or other issues that may have contributed to the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idle, oil leaks (especially around the valve cover or rear main seal), excessive crankcase pressure, whistling noise, and potential damage to other engine components like the turbocharger. The PCV valve diaphragm inside the valve cover often tears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover assembly (as the PCV valve is integrated).  Upgraded aftermarket options exist that offer a replaceable PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Water Outlet/Thermostat Housing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Coolant leaks visible under the car, low coolant level, overheating, sweet smell of coolant, check engine light. The plastic water outlet and thermostat housing are prone to cracking and leaking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water outlet/thermostat housing.  Consider an aftermarket aluminum upgrade for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idle, misfires, poor fuel economy.  Cracks can develop in the intake manifold, leading to vacuum leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbo Diesel Engine**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, DPF clogging.  Can be caused by short trips and infrequent highway driving.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration, DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement.  Investigate underlying causes such as faulty sensors or injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (cleaning) - $2000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, check engine light, fuel leak. The high-pressure fuel pump is prone to failure.
    * Solution: Fuel pump replacement
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both 1.4L and 2.0L Diesel)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Rough or jerky shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear.  Slipping during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and fill.  In some cases, valve body repair or replacement is needed.  For severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially over bumps.  Poor handling and steering response.  Worn control arm bushings and sway bar bushings are common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings or complete control arm assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per corner
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Dead battery, difficulty starting, requiring frequent jump starts.  Can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution:  Thorough diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw.  Repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Freezing, screen glitches, no sound, or complete failure of the MyLink infotainment system.

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Cruze, while offering good fuel economy and a comfortable ride, does have several potential reliability concerns. The 1.4L turbo engine is particularly susceptible to PCV system failure, coolant leaks, and turbocharger issues. The 2.0L diesel can have DPF and fuel pump issues. Transmission problems, suspension wear, and electrical glitches are also common complaints. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively inexpensive fixes to more costly repairs, potentially making the long-term ownership of a 2014 Cruze more expensive than some of its competitors. It is important to thoroughly inspect any used 2014 Cruze and address any known issues before purchase.
