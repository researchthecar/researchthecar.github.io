**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Cruze has several potential issues, primarily revolving around the engine (especially oil consumption and turbocharger problems with the 1.4L gasoline engine) and transmission (harsh shifting). Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also relatively common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences (infotainment glitches) to potentially expensive repairs (engine or transmission failure). The estimated cost to fix can vary significantly depending on the specific issue and the required repair, ranging from a few hundred dollars for simple fixes to several thousand for major component replacements.
