The 2012 Chevrolet Cruze marked the vehicle's second year of production and brought a fresh offering to the compact car market. It was available with two engine options: a 1.8L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 138 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 producing 138 hp and 148 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Cruze for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and stylish interior, while common complaints centered around reliability issues, particularly with the 1.4L turbo engine, and some perceived cheapness of certain interior materials.

**Summary**

The 2012 Chevrolet Cruze, particularly those equipped with the 1.4L turbo engine, exhibit several common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most prevalent problems revolve around the engine and transmission, with potential turbocharger failures, PCV system issues, coolant leaks, and transmission problems such as harsh shifting and slipping being the most concerning. While some of these issues may be relatively inexpensive to address, others can be quite costly, potentially requiring significant repairs or even replacement of major components. It's important to have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase and to budget for potential repairs.
