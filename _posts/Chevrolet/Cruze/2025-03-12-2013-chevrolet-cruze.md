The 2013 Chevrolet Cruze is a compact sedan that was offered with a few different engine and transmission options. The most common engine is the 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder, producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Other available engines included a 1.8L naturally aspirated four-cylinder. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Cruze for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and stylish interior, but often complain about its reliability, especially with the 1.4L turbo engine, and some find the performance underwhelming.
