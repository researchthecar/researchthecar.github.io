The 2016 Chevrolet Cruze is a compact car known for its fuel efficiency and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine (153 hp, 177 lb-ft of torque) and a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine (137 hp, 240 lb-ft of torque). The gasoline engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Cruze for its fuel economy and quiet cabin, but some common complaints include issues with the emissions system, particularly the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system, and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged Gasoline Engine**

*   **PCV Valve Failure/Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idling, check engine light illuminated. The PCV valve is integrated into the intake manifold, and its failure often leads to the intake manifold cracking, causing a vacuum leak.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold, including the integrated PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, check engine light illuminated, whistling or grinding noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Diesel Engine**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, reduced engine power, messages related to DEF quality or level. Issues can stem from faulty DEF sensors, DEF pump failures, or clogged DEF injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the specific component failure within the DEF system. This could involve replacing the DEF injector, pump, or sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, rough idling, check engine light illuminated.
    *   Solution: Glow plug replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Gasoline Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or when downshifting.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and software update. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or, in severe cases, transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush/software update), $800 - $1500+ (valve body), $3000 - $5000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (Diesel Engine)**

*   **Delayed or Erratic Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating, shifts that are not smooth or at the expected RPM.
    * Solution: Software updates and potentially replacement of faulty transmission components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll when cornering, clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Strut/shock replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, needing frequent jump starts. Often caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the source of the parasitic drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates or, in severe cases, replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update, if available) - $800+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heater not working.
    *   Solution: Seat heater replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2016 Chevrolet Cruze has some notable issues, particularly concerning the PCV system on the 1.4L gasoline engine and the DEF system on the 1.6L diesel engine. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting, can also occur. Electrical problems, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are less frequent but can be frustrating. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like turbocharger or transmission replacement, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection.
