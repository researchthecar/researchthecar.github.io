The 2000 Chevrolet Lumina, also known as the L30 in some trims, was a mid-size sedan offering comfortable transportation and a relatively affordable price. Engine options included a 3.1L V6 producing 160 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque and a 3.8L V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. All Luminas came equipped with a 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Lumina for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and simple, easy-to-maintain mechanicals. Common complaints centered around the car's somewhat bland styling, basic interior features, and occasionally lackluster fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2000 Chevrolet Lumina, while a reliable car in its day, is now facing age-related issues. The most common problems revolve around the engine (intake manifold leaks) and transmission (shifting problems). Suspension and electrical issues are also fairly common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission work can be costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the car for these common problems and factor in the potential repair costs when making a purchase decision.
