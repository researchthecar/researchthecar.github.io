The 2009 Chevrolet W5500HD Tiltmaster is a medium-duty cab-over truck designed for commercial applications. It was offered with a 5.2L Isuzu 4HK1-TC diesel engine rated at 200 horsepower and 441 lb-ft of torque, coupled with an Aisin A465 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the truck's maneuverability in urban environments and its ease of maintenance due to the tilt cab design. Common complaints often revolve around the relatively low horsepower for heavy loads and some reliability issues with certain components.

**Summary**

The 2009 Chevrolet W5500HD Tiltmaster, while appreciated for its maneuverability, is prone to issues common to diesel medium-duty trucks of its age. Engine issues, particularly those related to fuel injectors, the DPF, and EGR valve, can be costly to address. Transmission problems, especially harsh shifting and slippage, can also lead to significant repair expenses. Suspension and electrical issues, while generally less costly, can contribute to overall maintenance expenses. Rust is a potential concern in regions with harsh weather conditions. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs.
