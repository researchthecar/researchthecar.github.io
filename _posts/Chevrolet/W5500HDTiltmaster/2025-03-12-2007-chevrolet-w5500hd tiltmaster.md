Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2007 Chevrolet W5500HD Tiltmaster, organized by category and engine/transmission option where applicable.

The 2007 Chevrolet W5500HD Tiltmaster is a cab-over-engine (COE) medium-duty truck, often used for delivery, utility, and service applications. This truck came standard with a 5.7L Vortec V8 gasoline engine (around 295 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque) or an optional 5.2L Isuzu 4HK1-TC turbocharged diesel engine. The gas engine was typically paired with a 4L80E 4-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel engine came with an Aisin A465 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Tiltmaster for its maneuverability in urban environments and its good visibility due to the cab-over design. Dislikes include the limited space in the cab and potential maintenance complexities due to the COE configuration.
