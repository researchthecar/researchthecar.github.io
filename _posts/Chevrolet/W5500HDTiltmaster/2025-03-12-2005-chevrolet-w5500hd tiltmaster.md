The 2005 Chevrolet W5500HD Tiltmaster is a medium-duty cab-over truck often used for commercial applications like delivery, landscaping, and construction. It was offered with both a 5.7L V8 gasoline engine producing approximately 295 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque as well as a 7.8L Isuzu inline-six diesel engine producing approximately 200 horsepower and 441 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions were Aisin A465 4 speed automatic or the Aisin A465 5 speed automatic. Owners often praise the Tiltmaster for its maneuverability in urban environments and ease of maintenance due to the tilting cab design. Common complaints include relatively low horsepower for the gasoline engine and age-related issues with components due to it being a 20 year old vehicle.

**Summary:**

The 2005 Chevrolet W5500HD Tiltmaster, while a reliable workhorse, is susceptible to age-related issues. The most common problems revolve around the engine (misfires, leaks, turbocharger issues in diesel models), transmission (harsh shifting, slipping), suspension (worn bushings), and electrical system (battery drain, alternator failure). Rust is also a concern, especially in regions with harsh weather. The severity and cost of these repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage. Regular maintenance and inspections are crucial to minimizing potential problems and extending the life of the vehicle. Keep in mind that because it is a work vehicle, many of the issues it has will be caused by its intensive use.
