The 2004 Chevrolet W5500HD Tiltmaster is a medium-duty cab-over truck popular for its maneuverability and payload capacity. Common engine options include the 5.7L Vortec V8 gasoline engine, producing around 270 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, and the 7.8L Isuzu 6HK1-TC diesel engine with horsepower ranging from 200-230hp and torque between 520-540 lb-ft. Drivers often appreciate the truck's tight turning radius and ease of access to the engine for maintenance. However, the cab-over design can result in a less comfortable ride and increased noise compared to conventional trucks. The limited aftermarket support and potential for higher repair costs due to the Isuzu-based components can also be drawbacks.
