### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Chevrolet Impala Limited is a generally dependable sedan, especially when equipped with the 2.5L engine. The 3.6L V6, while offering more power, has a higher propensity for specific issues like intake manifold leaks and timing chain problems, though these are not universal. Transmission issues, particularly with the 6-speed automatic, can arise, often manifesting as harsh shifting. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are common wear items that may require attention on higher-mileage examples.
