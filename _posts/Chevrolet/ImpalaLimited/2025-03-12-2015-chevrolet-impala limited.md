The 2015 Chevrolet Impala Limited, also known as the Impala Classic, was a fleet-only model offered alongside the redesigned 2014+ Impala. It represented the final year of the previous generation Impala and came standard with a 3.6L V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Impala Limited for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and straightforward mechanicals. Common dislikes include its dated styling compared to the newer Impala, some cheap interior materials, and its relatively bland driving experience.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potentially engine knocking due to insufficient lubrication.
    *   Solution: The potential solutions vary based on the severity of the issue. For minor consumption, switching to a higher viscosity oil might help. More severe cases could necessitate replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L V6 engine is known to have timing chain issues, which typically manifest as a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Ignoring the issue can lead to more serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is the standard fix. It's often recommended to replace the water pump at the same time, as it's easily accessible during this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear or during downshifts.
    *   Solution: A software update (reprogramming the transmission control module) might resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter is usually required. It's often recommended to flush the transmission fluid and inspect the transmission for any debris caused by the failing torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature failure of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks is the recommended fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Power Window Regulator**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate, often due to a faulty window regulator. This can be identified by hearing the motor running but the window not moving, or no motor noise at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window regulator assembly is the standard repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Summary**

The 2015 Chevrolet Impala Limited is a reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues to be aware of. The most prevalent issues revolve around the 3.6L V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, including excessive oil consumption, timing chain problems, and harsh shifting. Electrical issues, such as failed window regulators, are also somewhat common.
