The 2014 Chevrolet Impala Limited, also known as the Impala Classic, was a fleet-only version of the previous generation Impala, offered alongside the redesigned 2014 Impala. It primarily served rental companies and government fleets. It came standard with a 3.6L V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Other engine and transmission options were not available. The Impala Limited was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and large trunk. However, it was criticized for its outdated styling, lack of modern features, and lower-grade interior materials compared to the redesigned 2014 Impala.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may be indicated by low oil level warnings, engine noise, or visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: The fix varies. Initially, a software update to the Engine Control Module (ECM) was tried to improve the oil life monitoring system. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement or even engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to rough running, a check engine light, and potential engine damage. Symptoms may include engine noise, misfires, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is the typical solution. In some cases, damage caused by the timing chain failure may necessitate further engine repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, as well as delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can help. However, often, the problem requires valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the front struts/shocks wearing out prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances. This is often noticeable at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts/shocks is the solution. It is recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain overnight or within a few days of being parked, leading to difficulty starting the car. This can be caused by a faulty module or electrical component that continues to draw power when the car is off.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic drain is necessary. This may involve testing individual circuits and components. Once the source is identified, the faulty component needs to be replaced or repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Radio/Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio may malfunction, displaying a blank screen, not turning on, or having intermittent audio issues.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the nature of the problem. Replacing the radio may be necessary, and in some cases a programming issue causes it and can be fixed with a software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system. This may be caused by a faulty sensor, wiring problem, or a problem with the airbag control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool is necessary to determine the cause of the light. Once the issue is identified, the faulty component needs to be replaced or repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Chevrolet Impala Limited, while offering space and comfort, faces several common issues. The engine can suffer from excessive oil consumption and timing chain problems, potentially leading to expensive repairs. The transmission may exhibit harsh shifting or delayed engagement. Suspension components may wear prematurely, and electrical problems, such as battery drain and infotainment system malfunctions, can occur. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
