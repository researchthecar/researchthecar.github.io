The 2017 Chevrolet Colorado is a mid-size pickup truck offering a blend of practicality and comfort. Engine options for this model year include a 2.5L inline-4, a 3.6L V6, and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel. The 3.6L V6 produces 308 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (only with the 2.5L engine), a 6-speed automatic, and an 8-speed automatic (paired with the 3.6L V6 in later production models). Owners often praise the Colorado for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel), and car-like ride quality. Common complaints include the sometimes clunky transmission, certain infotainment quirks, and less rear-seat space compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**
No Issues Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between scheduled changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, or low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: The fix varies depending on the severity. Initially, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test. More severe cases may require replacing valve cover, piston rings, or ultimately the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil consumption test) - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can wear prematurely, leading to a stretched chain. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, a check engine light, and potential misfire codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**
*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system can trigger the check engine light and a "reduced engine power" warning. Issues can stem from a faulty DEF injector, DEF level sensor, or DEF pump.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for trouble codes and testing the components. Replacement of the faulty part is usually the fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. This can manifest as noticeable jolts or delays during gear changes.
    *   Solution: A software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) may help in some cases. In other cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ depending on the component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (Later Production, paired with 3.6L)**

*   **"Chuckle" or "Shudder" at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A distinct "chuckle" or shuddering sensation, especially when driving at low speeds (20-40 mph), is a common complaint. This is often attributed to the torque converter clutch (TCC) engagement.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and replacement with an updated fluid formulation (Mobil Delvac Synthetic ATF) has been known to fix the issue. In some cases, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs can develop a squeaking noise, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring bushings or replacing the bushings can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on whether bushings need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyLink infotainment system can experience freezing, crashing, or delayed responses.
    *   Solution: Software updates are available. Sometimes a full system reset is required. In some cases, the entire head unit needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for parasitic draws. A faulty module or accessory may be draining the battery. Replacing the battery or fixing the parasitic draw is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Bed Rail Caps Cracking/Fading**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic bed rail caps are prone to cracking or fading, especially in sunny climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the bed rail caps.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Lid Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The latch on the center console lid can break easily, preventing the lid from staying closed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the latch or the entire center console lid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Chevrolet Colorado has a mix of minor and more significant issues. The 3.6L V6 can experience excessive oil consumption and timing chain issues which can be costly to repair. The transmissions, both the 6-speed and 8-speed automatics, have reported issues with shifting and shuddering, which may require a software update, fluid change, or even more serious repairs. Electrical issues, such as the infotainment system freezing and battery drain, are also relatively common. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, making a thorough inspection essential before purchasing a used 2017 Colorado.
