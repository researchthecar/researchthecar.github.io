The 2010 Chevrolet Colorado is a compact pickup truck that offered a blend of utility and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 2.9L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 185 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 3.7L inline-5 cylinder engine producing 242 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine choice. Owners generally appreciated the Colorado's maneuverability and decent fuel economy, especially with the smaller engines. However, some disliked the cramped rear seating in the extended cab models and the somewhat dated interior design.
