The 2009 Chevrolet Colorado is a mid-size pickup truck offering versatility for both work and personal use. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 185 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 2.9L inline-4 producing 185 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque (this was later superseded by the 3.7L I5 in later model years), and a 3.7L inline-5 producing 242 hp and 242 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Colorado's maneuverability and fuel efficiency compared to full-size trucks, while common criticisms include its relatively basic interior and some reliability concerns.
