The 2024 Chevrolet Colorado is a mid-size pickup truck offering a blend of work capability and everyday usability. It comes standard with a turbocharged 2.7L inline-4 engine, available in three output levels. The base engine produces 237 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. A mid-range tune delivers 310 hp and 391 lb-ft of torque, while the high-output version also produces 310 hp but increases torque to 430 lb-ft. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Colorado's updated interior, improved ride quality, and off-road capabilities (especially in the ZR2 trim). Common dislikes include the lack of a V6 option (compared to previous generations), and some concerns about the long-term reliability of the new turbocharged engine.
