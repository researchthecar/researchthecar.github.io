The 2004 Chevrolet Colorado marked the beginning of a new generation of mid-size trucks for Chevrolet, replacing the long-running S-10. It was available in multiple cab configurations (regular, extended, and crew cab) and with two engine options: a 2.8L inline-4 engine producing 175 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5L inline-5 engine producing 220 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Colorado for its maneuverability, fuel economy (relative to larger trucks), and car-like ride. However, common complaints included issues with the interior plastics, some reliability concerns, and the somewhat underpowered base engine, depending on usage.

**Summary:**

The 2004 Chevrolet Colorado has a mix of potential issues, with engine and electrical problems being among the most concerning. Cylinder head cracks on the 2.8L and oil pressure sensor issues on the 3.5L can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM can be frustrating to diagnose and resolve. While some suspension and interior issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, transmission problems can be a major expense. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect any prospective purchase thoroughly.
