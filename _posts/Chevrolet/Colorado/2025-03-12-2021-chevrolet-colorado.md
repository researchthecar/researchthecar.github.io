Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado, categorized by component and engine/transmission configuration, formatted for your website.

The 2021 Chevrolet Colorado is a mid-size pickup truck that appeals to buyers looking for a more manageable size than full-size trucks, while still offering decent capability. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 producing 200 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 producing 308 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Duramax turbodiesel producing 181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L inline-4 engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L V6 and 2.8L Duramax turbodiesel are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its maneuverability, comfortable ride (depending on trim), and available diesel engine. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior, and the sometimes-clunky 8-speed transmission.
