The 2020 Chevrolet Colorado is a mid-size pickup truck offering a blend of practicality and comfort. It comes in several trims, including Work Truck, LT, Z71, and ZR2. Engine options include a 2.5L Inline-4 (200 hp and 191 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (308 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (181 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque). The V6 engine is generally paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.5L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A 6-speed automatic transmission is available with the diesel engine. People appreciate the Colorado for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel), and available off-road capabilities (especially in the ZR2 trim). Common complaints revolve around the infotainment system, some build quality issues, and the relatively high price point compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption between oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently, low oil level warnings, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels closely and adding oil as needed. Some owners have had success with switching to a different brand or viscosity of oil. In more severe cases, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for oil changes/top-offs) to $3,000+ (for engine repair/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

* **Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, especially at startup or when the engine is cold. Can lead to rough running, misfires, and eventually engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, which often requires removing the cylinder head.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Camshaft Position Actuator Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, poor acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes often point to camshaft position actuator issues.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft position actuator(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

* **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues with the DEF system, including sensor failures, DEF pump failures, and clogged injectors. Can lead to reduced engine power, warning lights, and the engine entering "limp mode."
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the specific issue with the DEF system and replacement of the faulty component(s). This could include sensors, pumps, or injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 3.6L V6)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears (1st to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd). Hesitation or delay when accelerating from a stop. This can often feel like a "bump" or "clunk" during shifting.
    * Solution: Transmission flush and fill with updated fluid. In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can help. For more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (flush/fill) to $3,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (radio, navigation, etc.) freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes completely. This can occur randomly and may require restarting the vehicle to resolve temporarily.
    * Solution: Software updates to the infotainment system. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment screen/unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $800+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period of time, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle. This can be caused by parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    * Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component. This may involve testing individual circuits and components to isolate the problem.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Heater Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters stop working, either completely or only heating partially. This can be due to a faulty heating element, wiring issues, or a problem with the seat heater control module.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the specific cause of the seat heater failure and replacement of the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Chevrolet Colorado, while a capable and versatile truck, does have some common issues owners have reported. Engine issues such as lifter failures, camshaft position actuator issues, and DEF problems for the diesel engine can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the 8-speed automatic can lead to harsh shifting. Electrical problems such as infotainment freezing and battery drain are also common. These issues vary in severity and cost, ranging from minor inconveniences to major repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect any used Colorado before purchase, and consider obtaining a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic.
