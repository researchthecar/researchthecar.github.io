### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Chevrolet Colorado generally exhibits good reliability, particularly with its gasoline engines and transmissions. The 2.8L Duramax diesel engine, while offering excellent torque and fuel economy, has a few documented issues related to its Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) system and glow plugs, which are common for modern diesel powertrains and can incur moderate repair costs. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are also noted but do not appear to be systemic. Overall, the Colorado is a solid choice for a mid-size truck, with most potential issues being manageable and not indicative of widespread design flaws.
