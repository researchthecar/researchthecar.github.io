The Bugatti Divo, produced in limited quantities in 2021, is a hypercar based on the Chiron, known for its enhanced aerodynamics and track-focused performance. It features the same powerhouse as the Chiron: an 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine producing a staggering 1,500 horsepower and 1,180 lb-ft of torque. The engine is exclusively paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the Divo for its exclusivity, stunning design, and incredible performance capabilities. However, some criticisms often include the extremely high price tag and the limited usability in everyday driving scenarios due to its track-focused nature.
