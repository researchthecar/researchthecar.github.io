The 2022 Bugatti Divo is a limited-production, track-focused hypercar derived from the Bugatti Chiron. It boasts an 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine producing 1,500 horsepower and 1,180 lb-ft of torque. It is available only with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners typically praise its stunning design, incredible performance, and exclusivity. Common dislikes revolve around its extremely high price tag, limited practicality due to its track focus, and potential for very expensive maintenance. Given the limited production run of the Divo (only 40 were made), finding widespread and commonly reported issues is challenging. Data is limited to automotive forums and owner reports, which may not always be verifiable.
