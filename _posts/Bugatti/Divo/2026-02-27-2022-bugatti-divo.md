# 2022 Bugatti Divo

### Overview
The 2022 Bugatti Divo represents the pinnacle of hypercar engineering, focusing on extreme performance, bespoke luxury, and track-focused aerodynamics. As a limited-production model derived from the Chiron, its technical complexity is immense. Reliability data for such exclusive vehicles is scarce in public domains, as owners typically engage with authorized service centers for any concerns. The Divo's design prioritizes performance over long-term, everyday usability, meaning any potential issues would likely stem from its highly specialized components and extreme operating conditions rather than common automotive failures. Maintenance and repair are handled by a select few highly trained technicians.
