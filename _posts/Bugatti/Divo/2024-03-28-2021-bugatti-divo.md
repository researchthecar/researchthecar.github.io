## 2021 Bugatti Divo

The 2021 Bugatti Divo is a limited-edition supercar based on the Chiron. It features a revised body design that improves aerodynamics and downforce. The Divo is powered by the same 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine as the Chiron, which produces 1,500 horsepower and 1,180 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission option is a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic.

Despite its high price tag, the Divo has received mixed reviews. Some critics have praised its performance and handling, while others have found it to be too expensive and impractical.
