    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, loss of power, fuel smell. The fuel injectors in the W16 engine can fail due to the high pressures and extreme operating conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injectors. Requires specialized tools and expertise due to the engine's complex design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises, reduced power, error codes. The turbochargers, due to their high boost pressures and heat, are prone to wear and potential failures.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the affected turbocharger(s). The W16 engine has four turbochargers, so the cost can escalate quickly if multiple units need attention.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $25,000+

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, jerky shifts, difficulty engaging gears. The dual-clutch transmission experiences significant stress due to the engine's immense power. The clutches are known to wear out relatively quickly, especially with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch pack. This is a complex procedure that requires specialized tools and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $25,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission not shifting properly, getting stuck in gear, error messages on the dashboard. The mechatronic unit controls the shifting functions of the transmission.
