The 2009 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 is an iconic supercar known for its groundbreaking performance and opulent luxury. Its centerpiece is the quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 engine, producing a staggering 1,001 horsepower and 922 lb-ft of torque. This engine is exclusively mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the Veyron's mind-bending acceleration, top speed, and exclusivity. Conversely, criticisms frequently revolve around the extremely high running costs, complex maintenance requirements, and limited practicality for everyday use. Because it has no other engine and transmission options, these are the only options available for this particular model.
