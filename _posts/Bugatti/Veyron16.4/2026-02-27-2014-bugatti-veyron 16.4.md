### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 is a marvel of engineering, with its core powertrain and structural components demonstrating remarkable durability given its extreme performance capabilities. However, the complexity inherent in such a hypercar means that specialized components, particularly within the transmission (DSG mechatronics, clutch packs) and suspension (adaptive dampers), can be sources of significant repair costs if issues arise. Electrical systems, especially the infotainment and ECU, may also present rare but expensive problems. While routine maintenance is crucial, major failures are infrequent, but when they occur, they demand specialized expertise and substantial financial investment, typical for vehicles in this ultra-luxury and high-performance segment.
