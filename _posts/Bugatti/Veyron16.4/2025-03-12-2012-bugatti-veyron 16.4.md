The 2012 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 is a marvel of engineering, renowned for its incredible speed and opulent luxury. The heart of this beast is an 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine, producing an astonishing 1,001 horsepower and 922 lb-ft of torque. This immense power is routed through a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Veyron's exhilarating acceleration, exclusive status, and meticulous craftsmanship. Criticisms often revolve around the car's extraordinarily high running costs, complex maintenance requirements, and limited practicality.
