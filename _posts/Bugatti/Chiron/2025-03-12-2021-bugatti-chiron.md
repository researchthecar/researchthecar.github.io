The 2021 Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine, all-wheel-drive hypercar known for its extreme performance and luxury. The standard engine is an 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine producing 1,500 horsepower and 1,180 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. There is also a Chiron Sport version that has the same engine, but is lighter weight and has a stiffer suspension. The Chiron is praised for its unparalleled acceleration, opulent interior, and exclusivity. However, criticisms often include its very high price tag, limited practicality, and substantial running costs.

**Engine**

**8.0L Quad-Turbocharged W16**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of fuel injector failures leading to rough idling, misfires, and potential engine damage. This is a crucial part that needs to work for optimal engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injectors, with careful inspection of the fuel system for any contamination.

**Summary**

The 2021 Bugatti Chiron, while an incredible feat of engineering, is not without its potential issues. The most common problems reported revolve around the complex engine and transmission, with potential failures in the fuel injection system, cooling system, clutch, and mechatronic unit. Suspension and electrical issues also occur. Due to the car's complexity and high cost of parts, repairs can be exceptionally expensive, potentially reaching tens of thousands of dollars or more. While some issues are considered less severe, the high cost of ownership is definitely something to be aware of.
