### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Alfa Romeo 166 is a stylish and engaging car, but it requires diligent maintenance and awareness of its potential weak points. Common issues revolve around the Twin Spark engine's timing belt and ignition, the Busso V6's oil leaks, and diesel variants' DPF and turbocharger systems. Transmission reliability can vary, with automatics sometimes requiring attention to the torque converter or valve body. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and ABS sensors, are not uncommon. Suspension components like bushings can wear, and exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Interior climate control fans and seat wear are also noted. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the driving experience and unique character of the 166 to be worth the investment in upkeep.
