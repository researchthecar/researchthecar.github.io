### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Alfa Romeo 166 offers a unique blend of style and driving pleasure, but it is not without its potential reliability concerns. The Twin Spark engines can suffer from camshaft wear and water pump issues, while the V6 Busso engines are more prone to oil leaks. Diesel variants, particularly the JTDm, may face DPF and turbocharger problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the Q-System, can be costly to repair if the torque converter or valve body fails. Electrically, the Body Control Module and window regulators are known weak points. Suspension components like bushings and springs require attention, and rust can be an issue on older examples. Interior wear and climate control display problems are also common. While not a universally unreliable car, prospective owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs and the need for diligent upkeep, especially concerning the more complex mechanical and electrical systems. Regular servicing and addressing issues promptly are key to maintaining this Italian executive.
