### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Alfa Romeo 166, while a desirable car for its style and driving dynamics, presents a mixed reliability picture. The iconic Busso V6 engines are generally robust but can suffer from oil leaks and thermostat issues. The Twin Spark engines are more prone to head gasket and cam belt failures, requiring diligent maintenance. Diesel JTDm engines can face DPF and turbocharger problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the Q-System, are a known weak point with potential torque converter and valve body issues. Electrical gremlins, especially with the BCM and window regulators, are not uncommon. Suspension components like bushings can wear, leading to noise and handling degradation. Rust can be a concern on older examples. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of maintenance and repairs, which can be higher than average for the marque.
