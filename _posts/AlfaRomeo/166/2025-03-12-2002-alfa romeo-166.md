The 2002 Alfa Romeo 166 is a stylish Italian executive car known for its distinctive design and engaging driving experience. Engine options included a 2.0L Turbo inline-4, a 2.5L V6, a 3.0L V6, and a 3.2L V6, paired with either a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0L V6, for example, produced around 226 hp and 203 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praised the car's handling, unique styling, and comfortable interior. However, common complaints often centered around the car's reliability, electrical gremlins, and the high cost of parts and maintenance. This model is not electric.

**Summary**

The 2002 Alfa Romeo 166, while admired for its styling and driving dynamics, suffers from several common reliability issues. Engine problems such as timing belt and turbocharger failures can be severe and costly. Transmission problems, particularly with synchro wear in the manual gearboxes and slipping in the automatic, are also prevalent. Electrical gremlins and suspension issues further contribute to the overall maintenance burden. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making ownership potentially expensive, especially if deferred maintenance is needed.
