### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Alfa Romeo GTV is a desirable sports coupe with a characterful driving experience. Its reliability is a mixed bag; while the core mechanicals can be robust, specific components are known to require attention. The Twin Spark engines are prone to camshaft and ignition issues, while the V6 Busso engines require diligent timing belt maintenance. Manual transmissions can develop synchromesh problems or require clutch replacements. Suspension bushings and electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and central locking, are also common. Rust can be a significant concern, especially on older examples. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to developing problems, the GTV can remain a rewarding and stylish car to own.
