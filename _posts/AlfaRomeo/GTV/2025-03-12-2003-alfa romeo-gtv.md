The 2003 Alfa Romeo GTV is a stylish and sporty coupe, known for its distinctive Italian design and engaging driving experience. Available engine options included the 2.0L Twin Spark inline-four, producing approximately 150 horsepower and 137 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.0L V6 "Busso" engine, producing around 220 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the GTV for its beautiful aesthetics, nimble handling, and the characterful sound of the V6 engine. However, common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with electrical systems, as well as higher than average maintenance costs.
