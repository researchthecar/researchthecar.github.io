The 2008 Alfa Romeo GT is a stylish and sporty coupe, appreciated for its distinctive Italian design and engaging driving experience. Engine options for the 2008 model year included a 1.8L Twin Spark inline-4 (140 hp, 123 lb-ft torque), a 2.0L JTS inline-4 (165 hp, 151 lb-ft torque), a 3.2L V6 (240 hp, 221 lb-ft torque), and a 1.9L JTD diesel inline-4 (150-170 hp, varying torque). Transmission options were a 5-speed manual (1.8L and 1.9L), a 6-speed manual (2.0L, 3.2L and 1.9L), and a 6-speed Selespeed automated manual (2.0L). Owners often praise the GT's attractive styling and nimble handling, but common criticisms include reliability concerns and the cost of maintenance.

**Engine**

**1.8L Twin Spark**

* **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, loss of power, poor fuel economy, and potential stalling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty VVT actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L JTS**

* **Direct Injection Issues (Carbon Buildup)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, hesitation upon acceleration, reduced power, and potential engine misfires. This is due to carbon deposits accumulating on the intake valves, as the direct injection system doesn't wash the valves with fuel.
    * Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting or chemical cleaning) or installation of an oil catch can to reduce oil vapor recirculation.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Selespeed Actuator Problems (2.0L JTS with Selespeed Transmission Only)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, warning lights on the dashboard, and potential failure to start.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the Selespeed actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

* **Timing Belt Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noise from the engine, potential for catastrophic engine damage if the belt snaps.
    * Solution: Regular replacement of the timing belt and associated components (tensioners, idler pulleys) according to the manufacturer's recommended intervals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (Preventative Maintenance)
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.9L JTD**

* **EGR Valve Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential for the engine to go into limp mode.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Swirl Flap Issues (intake manifold)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and potential for damage if the flaps break off and enter the engine.
    * Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold or removal of the swirl flaps.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Selespeed (6-Speed Automated Manual)**
* **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, slow or jerky gear changes, warning lights, and eventual inability to select gears.
    * Solution: Replacement of the Selespeed hydraulic pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Wishbone/Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings or the entire wishbone/control arm assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Dashboard Display Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Pixel loss, dimming, or complete failure of the dashboard display.
    * Solution: Replacement or repair of the dashboard display unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window failing to move up or down, or moving slowly and erratically.
    * Solution: Replacement of the window regulator mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Door Handle Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door handle breaking or becoming difficult to use.
    * Solution: Replacement of the door handle mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sticky Interior Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some interior plastics, particularly on the center console, can become sticky and unpleasant to touch over time due to the degradation of the coating.
    * Solution: Cleaning and re-coating the affected trim pieces or replacing them.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the extent of the issue and chosen solution)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2008 Alfa Romeo GT, while attractive, suffers from a variety of potential issues. Engine problems range from VVT actuator failures in the 1.8L to carbon buildup in the 2.0L JTS and swirl flap issues in the 1.9L JTD. The Selespeed transmission is known for hydraulic pump problems. Suspension issues, particularly with front wishbone bushings, are also common. Electrical problems include dashboard display failures and window regulator issues. Interior trim can become sticky. Repair costs can vary significantly but can be high, especially for engine and transmission-related problems. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchase decision, planning for potential maintenance and repairs.
