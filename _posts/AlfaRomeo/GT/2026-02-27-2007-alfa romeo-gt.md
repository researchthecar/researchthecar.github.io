### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Alfa Romeo GT presents a mixed reliability profile. While the petrol engines (1.9L JTS and 3.2L JTS) and manual transmissions generally hold up well with no widespread reported issues, the diesel variants (1.9L JTDm and 2.4L JTDm) are more prone to issues related to the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and EGR valve, common in many modern diesels. Suspension components, particularly front wishbone bushings and rear springs, can require attention. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or window regulators, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain areas, and interior wear on the driver's seat bolster is common. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing specific known issues can contribute to a more reliable ownership experience, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas.
