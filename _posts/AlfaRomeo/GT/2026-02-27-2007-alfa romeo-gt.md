### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Alfa Romeo GT presents a mixed reliability profile. Diesel variants are more prone to issues related to the DPF and EGR systems, common in many modern diesels. Manual transmissions, particularly the M32 gearbox, can suffer from bearing wear. Suspension components like wishbone bushings and rear springs are also noted areas for potential attention. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or window regulators, can occur. Exterior rust, especially in common areas, and interior wear on seats are also points to consider. Despite these potential issues, many problems are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, allowing owners to enjoy the GT's distinctive character.
