### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Alfa Romeo GT presents a mixed reliability profile. While its engines, particularly the JTDm diesels, can be robust, they are susceptible to issues like DPF and EGR problems. Petrol engines, especially the Twin Spark, require diligent maintenance to avoid cam belt related failures. The manual transmissions, particularly the M32 gearbox, are known for bearing wear. Electrical gremlins and common exterior issues like rust are also points to consider. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the driving experience and styling of the GT rewarding, provided they are aware of and prepared for these specific reliability concerns.
