### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Alfa Romeo GT presents a mixed reliability profile. While its engines and transmissions can offer engaging performance, specific components like DPFs on diesel models and timing chains on some petrol variants require attention. Suspension components, particularly bushings and springs, are also noted areas for potential wear. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window mechanisms, can occur. Exterior rust, especially in common areas, and interior trim degradation are also points to consider. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the GT's driving experience and styling outweigh the maintenance demands, provided regular and proactive servicing is undertaken.
