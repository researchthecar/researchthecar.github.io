The 2007 Alfa Romeo GT is a stylish coupe praised for its distinctive Italian design and engaging driving experience. Available engine options include the 1.8L Twin Spark Inline-4 (140 bhp, 123 lb-ft), the 2.0L JTS Inline-4 (165 bhp, 151 lb-ft), and the 3.2L Busso V6 (240 bhp, 221 lb-ft). Diesel options include a 1.9L JTD Inline-4 (150 bhp, 225 lb-ft).
