Engine options for the 2004 model year include the 1.6L Twin Spark (120 hp, 107 lb-ft), 1.8L Twin Spark (140 hp, 123 lb-ft), 2.0L Twin Spark (150 hp, 137 lb-ft), 2.0L JTS (165 hp, 151 lb-ft), 2.5L V6 (192 hp, 165 lb-ft), and the 1.9L JTD diesel (115 hp, 203 lb-ft) and 2.4 JTD diesel (136 hp, 224 lb-ft). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (available on the 2.0 JTS, 2.5 V6 and diesel engines), and a 4-speed automatic (Selespeed). Owners often praise the 156 for its engaging driving dynamics and iconic Italian styling. Common complaints include a reputation for electrical gremlins, suspension wear, and relatively high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, particularly on startup, indicates a failing variable valve timing (VVT) variator. This affects engine performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VVT variator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Alfa Romeo V6 engine is an interference engine. This means if the timing belt fails it causes extensive damage. The timing belt and water pump should be replaced together according to a rigid schedule.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt and water pump. Extensive engine repairs are required if the timing belt breaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+ (belt and pump) or significantly more if the engine is damaged.

    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per leak depending on the location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.9L JTD/2.4 JTD Diesel**

*   **MAF (Mass Air Flow) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, poor fuel economy, and potential stalling can result from a faulty MAF sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, poor performance, and engine warning lights.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Selespeed**

*   **Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Selespeed automated manual transmission utilizes a hydraulic pump to actuate gear changes. The pump can fail, leading to difficulty shifting, complete transmission failure, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Selespeed pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Actuator Problems**

**Summary**

The 2004 Alfa Romeo 156 is a rewarding but demanding car to own. The most common issues range from relatively minor electrical gremlins and suspension wear to more significant engine problems, especially with the VVT variator and Selespeed transmission. Rust can also be a concern, depending on the car's history and location.  Repair costs can vary widely, but it's essential to factor in the potential for higher-than-average maintenance expenses when considering purchasing a 156. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the car's service history and have it inspected by a mechanic familiar with Alfa Romeos.
