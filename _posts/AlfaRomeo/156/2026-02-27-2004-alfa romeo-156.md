### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Alfa Romeo 156, while a desirable car for its driving pleasure and aesthetics, presents a mixed reliability picture. Common issues tend to revolve around the diesel particulate filters (DPF) on JTDm engines, timing belt maintenance on Twin Spark petrol engines, and potential failures within the Selespeed automated manual transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Body Control Module and window regulators, can also surface. Suspension components like wishbone bushings are known wear items. Rust can be a concern, especially on older models or those exposed to harsh climates. Despite these potential pitfalls, many issues are well-documented and repairable, making diligent maintenance and pre-purchase inspections key for owners.
