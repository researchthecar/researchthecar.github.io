### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Alfa Romeo 156, while a desirable car for its style and driving experience, is known to have specific reliability concerns. Diesel engines, particularly the JTDm variants, can suffer from DPF issues and turbocharger problems. Petrol Twin Spark engines require diligent maintenance, especially regarding the cam belt. The Selespeed transmission is a notable weak point, often requiring expensive repairs. Suspension components like wishbone bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and window regulators, can also arise. Exterior rust is a concern for cars in certain climates. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of maintenance and repairs, which can be higher than average for the segment.
