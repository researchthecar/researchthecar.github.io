### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Alfa Romeo 156 is a car that rewards passionate owners with its driving pleasure and distinctive style. However, potential buyers should be aware of its specific reliability quirks. Engines, particularly the Twin Spark petrol, require diligent maintenance, especially regarding the timing belt. Diesel engines can suffer from turbo and EGR issues. The Selespeed automatic transmission is a known weak point, often requiring costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and window regulators, are not uncommon. Rust can also be a concern on older examples. While not as universally reliable as some German or Japanese rivals, many issues are well-documented and repairable, making it a viable choice for those who prioritize character and driving experience over absolute dependability, provided a thorough pre-purchase inspection is conducted.
