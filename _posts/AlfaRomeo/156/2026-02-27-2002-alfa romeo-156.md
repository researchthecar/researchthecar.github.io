### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Alfa Romeo 156 presents a mixed reliability picture. While its engines, particularly the Twin Spark and JTD diesels, can be robust if maintained, they are prone to specific issues like variator problems or turbocharger wear. The Selespeed transmission is a notable weak point, often requiring significant investment to keep operational. Suspension components, especially bushings, can wear and lead to noise. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or sensors, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern on older models. Despite these potential drawbacks, for owners willing to address these issues with proper maintenance and timely repairs, the 156 can still offer an engaging and stylish driving experience.
