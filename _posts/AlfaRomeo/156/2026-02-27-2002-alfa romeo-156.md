### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Alfa Romeo 156 presents a classic case of Italian automotive charm mixed with potential reliability concerns. While the Twin Spark petrol engines are known for their engaging performance, they demand diligent maintenance, particularly regarding the timing belt. The JTD diesel engines are generally more robust but can suffer from turbocharger and EGR issues. The Selespeed transmission, while innovative, is a common source of expense due to its hydraulic system. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and window regulators, are not uncommon. Suspension components, particularly bushings, can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Overall, the 156 requires an owner who is prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs and is willing to address specific known issues proactively.
