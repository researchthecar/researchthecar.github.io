**Introduction to the 2014 Alfa Romeo Giulietta**

The 2014 Alfa Romeo Giulietta is a compact executive car known for its stylish design, agile handling, and premium interior. It was offered with a range of engines and transmissions, including gasoline-powered 1.4-liter MultiAir, 1.7-liter TBI, and 1.8-liter TBI engines, as well as a 2.0-liter JTDM diesel engine.
