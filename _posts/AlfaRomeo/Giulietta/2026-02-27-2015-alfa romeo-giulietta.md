### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Alfa Romeo Giulietta presents a mixed reliability profile. While its chassis and exterior/interior components generally hold up well, potential owners should be particularly mindful of the engine and transmission. Petrol models with the MultiAir engine can experience issues with the MultiAir unit itself. Diesel variants, common in many markets, are susceptible to DPF and EGR valve problems, especially if driven primarily on short urban journeys. The TCT dual-clutch transmission, while offering sporty performance, has a known risk of mechatronic unit or actuator failures, which can be costly to repair. Manual transmissions are generally more robust, with clutch wear being the primary concern. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, can also occur. Regular maintenance and mindful driving habits, especially for diesel particulate filters, are crucial for maximizing the Giulietta's longevity.
