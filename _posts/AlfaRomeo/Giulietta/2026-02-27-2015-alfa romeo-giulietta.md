### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Alfa Romeo Giulietta presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components and chassis are generally robust, potential owners should be mindful of specific issues. The MultiAir petrol engine can experience unit failures, and both diesel engines are susceptible to DPF problems, particularly if driven primarily in urban environments. The TCT dual-clutch transmission has also seen reports of gear selection issues. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these common faults, the Giulietta can remain a rewarding and stylish vehicle.
