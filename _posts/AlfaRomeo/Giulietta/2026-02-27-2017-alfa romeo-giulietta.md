### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulietta presents a mixed reliability profile. While the manual transmission and chassis components generally hold up well, owners should be mindful of potential issues with the MultiAir petrol engine unit and the TCT dual-clutch transmission, which can exhibit jerky shifting. Diesel variants are susceptible to DPF problems, a common concern for modern diesels. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Despite these potential drawbacks, the Giulietta remains a desirable option for those prioritizing style and driving engagement, provided they are prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs and specific repair needs compared to more mainstream competitors.
