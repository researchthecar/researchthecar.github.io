### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulietta presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the petrol MultiAir and diesel JTDm variants, are prone to specific issues like turbocharger problems, DPF regeneration issues, and EGR valve malfunctions, which can be costly to repair. The TCT automatic transmission has also seen reports of mechatronic unit and clutch pack failures. While the manual transmission and suspension systems appear more robust, electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, can occur. Exterior and interior components generally fare better with no widespread reported issues. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors, especially concerning the powertrain. Regular servicing and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating these potential problems.
