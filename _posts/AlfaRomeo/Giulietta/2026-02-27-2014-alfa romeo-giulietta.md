### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Alfa Romeo Giulietta presents a mixed reliability profile. While its chassis and exterior/interior components generally hold up well, potential owners should be particularly mindful of the engine and transmission systems. Diesel variants are prone to DPF and EGR issues, common in many modern diesels. Petrol MultiAir engines can suffer from unit failures. The TCT automatic transmission, while offering performance, has a history of mechatronic unit and solenoid problems, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Careful pre-purchase inspection and a budget for potential repairs, particularly for the powertrain, are recommended.
