### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Alfa Romeo Giulietta, while offering a compelling driving experience, exhibits some common reliability concerns, particularly within its powertrain. Petrol engines can suffer from turbocharger and MultiAir unit issues, while diesel variants are more prone to DPF and EGR problems. The TCT automatic transmission, though advanced, can be a source of costly repairs if the mechatronic unit or clutch packs fail. Suspension components like bushings and shock absorbers may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. The exterior and interior generally hold up well, with no widespread critical failures reported. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the possibility of higher maintenance costs compared to more mainstream competitors.
