The 2019 Alfa Romeo Giulietta is a stylish and sporty hatchback offered in several configurations. Engine options include a 1.4L turbocharged petrol engine (around 120 hp and 158 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.0L turbocharged petrol engine (ranging from 170 hp to 240 hp depending on the trim). Transmission options were primarily a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed TCT (Twin Clutch Transmission) automatic. People generally like the Giulietta for its distinctive Italian styling, agile handling, and relatively comfortable ride. Common complaints include concerns about reliability, the quality of some interior materials, and the relatively small size of the rear seats and trunk.
