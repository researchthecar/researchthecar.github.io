### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Alfa Romeo Giulietta presents a mixed reliability profile. While its engines and transmissions can offer engaging performance, they are also the most common sources of significant issues, particularly the MultiAir petrol engines and the TCT automatic transmission. Diesel variants are prone to DPF and EGR problems, common in many modern diesels. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and infotainment, can also be a concern. Suspension components like wishbone bushings may require attention. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the Giulietta's driving pleasure and distinctive styling outweigh the risks, provided they are prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs compared to more mainstream competitors.
