### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Alfa Romeo Giulietta presents a mixed reliability profile. While the chassis and general exterior/interior components are generally robust, potential owners should be aware of specific issues, particularly with the MultiAir petrol engine and the TCT dual-clutch transmission. Diesel variants, especially the 2.0L JTDm, can experience DPF and EGR valve problems, common in many modern diesels. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also noted. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning the DPF and transmission fluid changes, is crucial. Despite these potential concerns, the Giulietta remains a desirable option for those prioritizing style and driving engagement, provided they are prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs compared to some rivals.
