### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Alfa Romeo Giulietta presents a mixed reliability profile. While the chassis and exterior/interior components generally hold up well, potential owners should be particularly mindful of the engine and transmission options. Diesel variants are susceptible to DPF and EGR issues, common in many modern diesels. Petrol MultiAir engines can experience issues with the MultiAir unit itself. The TCT automatic transmission, while offering performance benefits, has a history of mechatronic unit and solenoid problems, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are also noted. Careful pre-purchase inspection and budgeting for potential repairs, especially concerning the powertrain, are recommended.
