The 2003 Alfa Romeo 147 is a stylish and sporty compact hatchback that offered a unique blend of Italian flair and driving dynamics. Common engine options included the 1.6L Twin Spark, 2.0L Twin Spark, and the 1.9L JTD diesel. The 2.0L Twin Spark engine produces around 150 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a Selespeed automated manual. Owners typically praise the 147 for its sharp handling, distinctive styling, and engaging driving experience. However, it is often criticized for its reliability issues, electrical gremlins, and relatively high maintenance costs.

**Summary**

The 2003 Alfa Romeo 147, while offering a sporty and stylish driving experience, is prone to several issues. Engine problems like VVT variator and coil pack failures are common across the petrol engines. The Selespeed transmission can be particularly problematic and expensive to repair. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also frequent concerns. While individual repair costs may vary, the cumulative effect of these issues can make the 147 a relatively high-maintenance vehicle. The severity of the issues range from moderate (coil pack failure) to severe (Selespeed transmission failure) impacting both running costs and overall reliability.
