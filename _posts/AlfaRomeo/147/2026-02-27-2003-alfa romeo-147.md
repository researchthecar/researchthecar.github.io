### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Alfa Romeo 147 presents a mixed reliability picture. While its engines, particularly the Twin Spark variants, can be prone to specific issues like timing belt and water pump problems, and the diesel engines may face turbo or EGR valve concerns, these are often manageable with timely maintenance. The Selespeed transmission is a notable area of potential expense due to its complex hydraulic system. Suspension components like bushings can wear, and electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM, are not uncommon. Rust can also be a concern depending on the vehicle's history and climate. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the driving experience and distinctive styling outweigh the reliability concerns, provided a diligent maintenance schedule is followed.
