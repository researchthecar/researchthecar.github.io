### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Alfa Romeo 147 presents a mixed reliability picture. While its engines, particularly the JTD diesels, can be robust if maintained, petrol Twin Sparks require diligent attention to timing belt intervals. The Selespeed transmission is a notable weak point, often incurring significant repair costs. Suspension components like wishbone bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and window regulators, are also reported. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance and repair costs compared to more mainstream competitors, with a strong emphasis on proactive maintenance and specialized servicing, particularly for the Selespeed gearbox.
