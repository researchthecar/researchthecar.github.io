**Introduction:**

The 2002 Alfa Romeo 147 is a compact hatchback that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 1.6-liter Twin Spark inline-four that produced 105 horsepower and 108 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 1.8-liter Twin Spark inline-four that produced 140 horsepower and 126 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0-liter Twin Spark inline-four that produced 150 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.9-liter JTD inline-four turbodiesel that produced 115 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a five-speed manual, a six-speed manual, and a five-speed Selespeed automated manual.

The 147 was praised for its stylish design, sporty handling, and comfortable interior. However, it was also criticized for its high fuel consumption and poor reliability.
