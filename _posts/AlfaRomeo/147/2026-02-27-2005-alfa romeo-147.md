### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Alfa Romeo 147 presents a mixed reliability profile. While its petrol engines, particularly the Twin Spark variants, can be prone to timing belt issues and VVT problems if not meticulously maintained, the JTDm diesel engines face challenges with DPFs and turbochargers. The Selespeed transmission is a notable area of concern, often requiring significant investment to keep operational. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module, and common suspension wear on wishbone bushings are also reported. Rust can be an issue on older examples. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the driving experience and distinctive styling outweigh the maintenance demands, provided a proactive approach to servicing and timely repairs.
