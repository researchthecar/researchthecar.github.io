### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Alfa Romeo 147 presents a mixed reliability profile. While its petrol Twin Spark engines can suffer from variator and ignition issues, and the diesel JTDm engines are prone to DPF and EGR problems, these are often addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. The Selespeed transmission is a notable area for potential expense due to its complex hydraulic system. Suspension components like wishbone bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and window regulators, can also arise. Rust can be a concern in certain environments. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the driving experience and distinctive styling outweigh the reliability concerns, provided they are prepared for the associated maintenance costs.
