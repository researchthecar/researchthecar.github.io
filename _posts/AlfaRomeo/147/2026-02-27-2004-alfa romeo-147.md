### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Alfa Romeo 147 presents a mixed reliability picture. While its engines, particularly the JTDm diesels, can be robust with proper maintenance, they are prone to specific issues like DPF and EGR problems. Petrol Twin Spark engines require diligent timing belt maintenance to avoid catastrophic failure. The Selespeed transmission is a notable weak point, often requiring significant investment to maintain. Suspension components and certain electrical items, such as window regulators and the BCM, can also develop faults. Rust can be a concern on older models. Overall, the 147 demands attentive maintenance and a willingness to address potential Italian car quirks, especially concerning the Selespeed gearbox and electrical systems.
