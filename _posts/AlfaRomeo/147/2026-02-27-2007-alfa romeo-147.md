### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Alfa Romeo 147 presents a mixed reliability profile. While its engines, particularly the JTDm diesels, can be robust if maintained, they are prone to specific issues like DPF and EGR problems. Petrol Twin Spark engines require diligent timing belt maintenance to avoid catastrophic failure. The Selespeed transmission is a notable weak point, with potential for costly hydraulic system repairs. Suspension components and certain electrical items, such as the BCM and window regulators, can also require attention. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate and care. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance costs.
