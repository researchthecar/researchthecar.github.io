### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Alfa Romeo 147 presents a mixed reliability profile. While its engines, particularly the JTDm diesels, can be robust if maintained, they are prone to specific issues like DPF clogging and turbo problems. Petrol Twin Spark engines require attention to their VVT systems and ignition components. Transmissions, especially the Selespeed automated manual, can be a significant source of expense due to hydraulic system failures. Suspension components like wishbone bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and window regulators, are not uncommon. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs, especially concerning the Selespeed gearbox and electrical systems, and factor in the cost of addressing these known issues.
