### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Alfa Romeo 147 presents a mixed reliability picture. While its engines, particularly the Twin Spark variants, require diligent maintenance (especially cam belt changes), they can be robust. The JTD diesel engines are generally more reliable but can suffer from turbo or EGR issues. The Selespeed transmission is a known weak point, often requiring significant investment to maintain. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and window regulators, are not uncommon. Suspension components like bushings can wear, and rust is a concern on older examples. Despite these potential issues, the 147 remains a desirable car for those who appreciate its driving character and Italian flair, provided they are prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs than some rivals.
