# 2020 Alfa Romeo 4C

### Overview
The 2020 Alfa Romeo 4C, a lightweight, mid-engine sports car, prioritizes performance and driving dynamics over everyday practicality and long-term reliability. While its focused design offers an exhilarating driving experience, it's important to note that it is a niche vehicle with a more complex maintenance profile than typical sedans or SUVs. Owners often accept a higher likelihood of minor issues in exchange for its unique character and track-focused capabilities. This data reflects common reported concerns, excluding routine maintenance and standard wear and tear.
