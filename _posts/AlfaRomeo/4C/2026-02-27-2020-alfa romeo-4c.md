# 2020 Alfa Romeo 4C Reliability Guide

### Overview
The 2020 Alfa Romeo 4C, a lightweight, mid-engine sports car, prioritizes performance and driving dynamics over everyday practicality and long-term reliability. While its focused design offers an exhilarating driving experience, it's important to note that it is a niche vehicle with a production run that concluded in 2020. Owners often report a high level of satisfaction with its handling and unique character. However, like many low-volume, performance-oriented vehicles, it can be more susceptible to certain issues compared to mass-produced sedans. Maintenance and repair costs can also be higher due to specialized parts and fewer service centers.
