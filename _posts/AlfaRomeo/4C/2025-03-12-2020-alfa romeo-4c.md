*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and potential check engine light activation are possible, sometimes caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils or spark plugs. Proper diagnosis using an OBD-II scanner is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Irregular idle, decreased fuel efficiency, potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Identify and seal the leaking vacuum hose or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (TCT)**

*   **Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, jerky or rough gear changes, especially at lower speeds. This is a known characteristic of some dual-clutch transmissions, but excessive roughness indicates a potential problem.
    *   Solution: A software update or recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) may help. In more severe cases, clutch replacement or internal transmission repair may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ for software updates, $3,000 - $8,000+ for clutch replacement or major repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, delayed gear changes, RPM flares without corresponding acceleration.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty components within the transmission, potentially including clutch packs, solenoids, or valve body issues. Transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Harsh Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4C is known for a stiff suspension setup, resulting in a harsh ride, especially on rough roads. This is inherent to the car's design, but excessive harshness might indicate worn shocks or suspension components.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn shocks or struts can slightly improve ride quality. Consider aftermarket adjustable coilovers for more customizable damping.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on components and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Creaking or popping noises from the suspension, especially during turns or over bumps. This can be caused by worn bushings, ball joints, or other suspension components.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension bushings, ball joints, or other relevant components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the specific component and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights, including check engine, ABS, or airbag lights, may illuminate due to sensor failures. Specific symptoms depend on the affected sensor (e.g., oxygen sensor, mass airflow sensor).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor using an OBD-II scanner and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor depending on the type and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rapid battery drain, especially when the car is not driven frequently.
    *   Solution: Investigate potential parasitic draws on the battery (e.g., aftermarket accessories, faulty modules). Test and replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement, $100 - $500+ for diagnosing and fixing parasitic draws.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, causing reduced visibility.
    *   Solution: Remove headlight housing, dry it, and reseal it. If resealing doesn't work, replace the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for resealing, $500 - $1,500+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that certain interior trim pieces, especially those with a soft-touch finish, can become sticky or tacky over time.
    *   Solution: Cleaning with specific products designed for soft-touch materials may temporarily improve the issue. However, replacement of the affected trim piece is often the only permanent solution.
