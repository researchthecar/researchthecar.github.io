### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Alfa Romeo 4C is a niche sports car where performance and driving engagement are paramount. Reliability is generally considered average for a low-volume exotic, with some specific areas requiring attention. The turbocharged engine and dual-clutch transmission are the most common sources of significant issues, particularly concerning performance and shifting. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, can also occur.
