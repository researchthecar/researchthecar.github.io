The 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C is a lightweight, mid-engined sports car known for its engaging driving experience and distinctive Italian styling. It came with a single engine option, a turbocharged 1.75-liter four-cylinder producing 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DCT) was the sole transmission choice. Owners generally appreciate the 4C's responsive handling, exotic looks, and raw driving feel. Common complaints include a harsh ride, limited practicality, a cramped interior, and some reliability concerns.
