The powertrain, particularly the TCT transmission, is the most common source of reported issues, with harsh shifting and warning lights being notable concerns. Engine-related problems like turbocharger issues and coolant leaks are also documented. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, can add to the ownership experience. However, the chassis, suspension, exterior, and interior components generally fare better, with fewer widespread problems. Prospective owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs and a greater likelihood of encountering specific mechanical issues compared to more mainstream sports cars.
