The 2019 Alfa Romeo 4C Spider is a lightweight, mid-engine sports car known for its sharp handling and distinctive Italian styling. It's powered by a 1.75-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners love the 4C's raw driving experience, its small size, and its unique aesthetics. However, it's often criticized for its stiff ride, limited practicality, lack of power steering, and some reliability concerns.
