### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Alfa Romeo 4C offers an exhilarating driving experience but comes with a reliability profile that requires careful consideration. The turbocharged engine and dual-clutch transmission are the primary areas where owners may encounter issues, such as turbocharger problems or transmission hesitation, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted. While the suspension, exterior, and interior generally fare well, the specialized nature of the 4C means repairs can be more expensive and parts less readily available than for mainstream vehicles. Prospective buyers should factor in potential maintenance and repair costs and seek out well-maintained examples.
