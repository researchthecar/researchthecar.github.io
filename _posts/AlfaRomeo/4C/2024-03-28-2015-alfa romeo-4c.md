**Introduction**

The 2015 Alfa Romeo 4C is a lightweight, mid-engined sports car that delivers an exhilarating driving experience. It is powered by a 1.75-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with a six-speed dual-clutch transmission. The 4C is praised for its handling, performance, and exotic styling, but it also has some notable issues.

**Engine**

**1.75-liter Turbocharged Four-Cylinder Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail, leading to a loss of power and acceleration. Symptoms include a loud whistling noise, reduced engine performance, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the turbocharger, which costs around $2,000 - $3,000+.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip and potentially damage the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, an illuminated check engine light, and rough engine operation. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner and related components, which costs around $1,000 - $2,000+.

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

* **Clutch Pack Failure:** The clutch pack can wear out prematurely, leading to slipping and shuddering during gear changes. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, slipping gears, and a burning smell from the transmission. The solution is to replace the clutch pack, which costs around $1,500 - $2,500+.
* **Transmission Control Unit Failure:** The transmission control unit (TCU) can malfunction, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not at all. Symptoms include delayed or rough shifting, a check engine light, and the transmission stuck in one gear. The solution is to replace the TCU, which costs around $1,000 - $1,500+.
