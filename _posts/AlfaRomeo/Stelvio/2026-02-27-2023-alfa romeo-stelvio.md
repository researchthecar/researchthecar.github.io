### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Alfa Romeo Stelvio presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components like the engine and transmission are generally robust, particularly the 2.0L turbo, owners should be aware of potential issues such as turbocharger lag, oil leaks, and occasional transmission shudder. The Quadrifoglio's V6, while powerful, can be more prone to coolant leaks and engine mount wear. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, and specific suspension components like control arm bushings are also noted. The Q4 AWD system's transfer case actuator can be a point of failure. Overall, the Stelvio requires diligent maintenance and prompt attention to any reported symptoms to ensure long-term reliability, with repair costs potentially being higher than average for premium European vehicles.
