### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, while a desirable vehicle for its performance and style, exhibits some common reliability concerns, particularly within its powertrain and electrical systems. The turbocharged engines, especially the potent V6 in the Quadrifoglio, can be prone to issues like turbocharger problems, oil leaks, and engine mount wear. The eight-speed automatic transmission may occasionally suffer from harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted. However, the suspension and interior/exterior components generally appear to be more robust. Prospective buyers should factor in potential repair costs for these specific areas, especially when considering a used model.
