### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, while praised for its driving dynamics and design, exhibits some common issues typical of a first-generation luxury vehicle. Engine-related concerns, particularly with the turbocharger and potential oil leaks, are noted for the standard 2.0L. The high-performance Quadrifoglio variant can experience engine mount and coolant leak issues. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting and TCM faults, are also reported for the 8-speed automatic. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are present. However, suspension, exterior, and interior components appear relatively robust with no widespread critical failures documented. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential areas and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections, especially for higher-mileage examples.
