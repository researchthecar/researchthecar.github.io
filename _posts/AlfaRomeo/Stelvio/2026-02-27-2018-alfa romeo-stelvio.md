### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, while praised for its driving dynamics and design, presents a mixed reliability profile. Owners have reported issues primarily concerning the powertrain, including turbocharger problems and oil leaks on the 2.0L engine, and engine mount and coolant leaks on the more powerful 2.9L V6. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings may require attention. However, the exterior and interior generally hold up well. Potential buyers should be aware of these specific technical concerns and factor in potential repair costs, especially for the higher-performance Quadrifoglio model.
