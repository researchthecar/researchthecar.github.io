### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Alfa Romeo Stelvio presents a mixed reliability profile. While its performance-oriented engines and ZF transmission are generally robust, owners have reported specific issues. The 2.0L turbo can experience turbocharger and oil leak problems, while the more potent 2.9L V6 in the Quadrifoglio models may face engine mount and coolant leak concerns. Transmission issues, though not widespread, can manifest as harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are noted. Exterior and interior trim can also be sources of minor annoyance with water leaks and rattles. Despite these points, many owners find the driving experience and styling outweigh the potential for these repairs, which are often manageable in cost if addressed promptly.
