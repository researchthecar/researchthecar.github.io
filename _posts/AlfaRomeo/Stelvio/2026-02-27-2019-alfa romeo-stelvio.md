### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Alfa Romeo Stelvio presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components like the engine and transmission are generally robust, particularly the ZF 8-speed automatic, owners should be aware of potential issues such as turbocharger lag and oil leaks on the 2.0L engine, and engine mount or coolant leaks on the more powerful V6. Suspension components, especially bushings and active dampers, can require attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. The exterior and interior generally hold up well, with no widespread critical failures reported. Overall, the Stelvio offers an engaging driving experience, but potential buyers should factor in the possibility of higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors, especially for the Quadrifoglio variant.
