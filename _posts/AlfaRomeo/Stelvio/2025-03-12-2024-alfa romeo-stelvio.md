**Summary**

The 2024 Alfa Romeo Stelvio presents a mixed bag. While it's praised for its performance and styling, potential buyers should be aware of potential reliability issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the infotainment system, and transmission concerns seem to be the most frequently reported. The cost of repairs can range from relatively minor fixes to more expensive component replacements, making pre-purchase inspection and extended warranties a worthwhile consideration. The engine issues, while present, seem less widespread than electrical and transmission problems, but potential oil consumption is still a factor to consider.
