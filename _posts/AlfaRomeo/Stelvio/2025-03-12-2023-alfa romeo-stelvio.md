**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L engine consuming more oil than expected between oil changes. This can manifest as the "low oil" warning light illuminating more frequently than normal.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is crucial. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection is recommended. The issue might be addressed by replacing the PCV valve or in more severe cases, replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.9L Twin-Turbo V6 (Quadrifoglio)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature turbocharger failure on the Quadrifoglio's engine. Symptoms include a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining, screeching), and potentially error codes related to turbocharger performance.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Inspecting the oil feed lines and ensuring proper lubrication are crucial to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 8-Speed Automatic (All Models)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifts, particularly when cold or during specific driving conditions (e.g., low speeds, uphill).
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can improve shift quality. In other cases, replacing the valve body is required. Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update), $1,500 - $3,000 (valve body replacement), $300 - $500 (fluid/filter change)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, particularly in the front end. This can lead to clunking noises over bumps and a decrease in handling precision.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings. Depending on the extent of the wear, replacing entire control arms might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 per corner (depending on parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system is a common source of complaints, with reports of freezing, crashing, slow response times, and Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If problems persist, a software update (if available) from the dealer may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset), $100 (software update), $1,000 - $2,000+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional reports of sensor malfunctions, affecting systems like parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, and adaptive cruise control.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using an OBD-II scanner to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the malfunctioning sensor.

**Summary**

The 2023 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, while praised for its performance and styling, does present owners with potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine (oil consumption, turbocharger failure in the Quadrifoglio) and electrical systems (infotainment glitches, sensor malfunctions). Transmission issues, suspension bushing wear, and interior rattles are also noteworthy.
