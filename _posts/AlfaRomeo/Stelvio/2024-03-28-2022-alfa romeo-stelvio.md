Owners appreciate the Stelvio's striking Italian design, responsive handling, and potent engines. However, it has also been noted for its limited interior space, infotainment system glitches, and reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**
- **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves:** Valve deposits lead to decreased engine performance, rough idling, and increased emissions. Fix involves walnut blasting or manually cleaning the valves.
- **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failures:** Premature wear or defects can cause fuel pressure drop, resulting in engine stalling or power loss. Requires fuel pump replacement.
- **Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Issues:** Malfunctioning wastegate actuator can affect turbo boost, leading to reduced power and potential engine damage. Replacement of the actuator may be necessary.
- Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**2.9L Twin-Turbocharged V6**
- **Connecting Rod Bearing Failure:** Premature bearing wear can lead to knocking noises, engine damage, and potential catastrophic failure. Replacement of the crankshaft and connecting rods is required.
- **Oil Pump Issues:** Faulty oil pump can cause insufficient lubrication, resulting in engine damage. Oil pump replacement and associated labor is needed.
- **Valve Spring Failure:** Broken valve springs can lead to engine damage and require replacement of the springs and associated components.
- Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission**
- **Delayed Gear Shifting:** Transmission hesitates or delays in shifting gears, resulting in poor driving experience. Software update or transmission control module replacement may be needed.
- **Shuddering or Jerking:** Violent vibrations or jerks during gear shifts can indicate transmission issues. Fluid replacement or transmission overhaul may be necessary.
- **Torque Converter Failure:** Premature wear or defects can lead to slipping, overheating, and transmission failure. Replacement of the torque converter and associated components is required.
