### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio presents a generally reliable package, particularly in its core mechanical components like the transmission and suspension, where major widespread issues are not commonly reported. However, owners should be aware of potential concerns primarily within the electrical system, specifically with the infotainment unit's responsiveness and occasional battery drain issues. The engine, while powerful, can experience oil leaks and, in the higher-performance Quadrifoglio variant, potential issues with engine mounts or cooling systems. These are not universal but represent areas where proactive maintenance or prompt attention to symptoms is advisable. Overall, the Stelvio offers a rewarding driving experience, but potential buyers should factor in the possibility of addressing these specific technical points.
