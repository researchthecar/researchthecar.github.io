### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio presents a generally reliable package, particularly concerning its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The 2.0L turbocharged engine and 8-speed automatic transmission are robust, though occasional issues like turbo lag or harsh shifting can arise and typically require software updates or fluid services. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, and minor interior rattles are the most commonly reported nuisances. Exterior paint's susceptibility to chipping is also a point of note. While not immune to issues, most problems are manageable and do not indicate systemic failures, allowing the Stelvio to remain a desirable option for those prioritizing driving engagement and style.
