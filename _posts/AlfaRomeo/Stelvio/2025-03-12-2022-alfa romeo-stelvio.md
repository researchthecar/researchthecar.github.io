Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2022 Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a stylish and sporty SUV known for its engaging driving dynamics and Italian flair. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 280 horsepower and 306 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its distinctive design, athletic handling, and comfortable front seats, some owners have noted concerns about reliability, electronic glitches, and the infotainment system's responsiveness.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported needing to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings on the dashboard or visible oil loss.
    *   Solution: The first step is to monitor oil levels and consumption rates accurately. If consumption is high, a dealer inspection may be necessary to check for leaks or other issues. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+, depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional hesitation during acceleration or, in some cases, stalling, particularly at lower speeds. This may be intermittent and not always easily reproducible.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics may be needed to check the fuel system, ignition system, and sensors. Software updates to the engine control unit (ECU) may also address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for diagnostics and software updates; more for component replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (ZF 8HP50)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. There might also be a noticeable delay or hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) might resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may also help. More severe cases might require valve body replacement or, in rare instances, transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software updates; $300 - $800 for fluid flush and filter change; $1,000 - $3,000+ for valve body replacement or transmission repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: A software update to the infotainment system might resolve the issue. In some cases, resetting the system or disconnecting the battery for a short period may temporarily fix the problem. If the issue persists, a replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates; $500 - $1500+ for infotainment unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions in various sensors, such as parking sensors or blind spot monitoring systems, can lead to false alerts or a complete failure of the system.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per sensor, depending on location and complexity.
