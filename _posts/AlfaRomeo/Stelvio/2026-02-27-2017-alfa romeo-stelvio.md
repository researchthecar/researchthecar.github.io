The 2017 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, while a compelling choice for its driving dynamics and design, exhibits some common first-year model concerns. The 2.0L turbocharged engine can experience issues with the turbocharger and oil leaks, while the 8-speed automatic transmission may present with shifting anomalies. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted. The suspension, exterior, and interior components appear to be relatively robust with no widespread reported failures. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential areas and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections, especially for vehicles with higher mileage or a less-than-perfect maintenance history.
