### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, while a stylish and engaging SUV, exhibits some common first-year model concerns, particularly in its powertrain. The 2.0L turbo engine can experience turbo lag or failure, and oil leaks are not uncommon. The high-performance 2.9L V6 in the Quadrifoglio variant is more prone to overheating and turbo issues. The 8-speed automatic transmission may develop harsh shifting or fluid leak problems. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system freezes and intermittent battery drain, are also reported. Suspension components like bushings can wear prematurely, leading to noise and handling degradation. Exterior and interior components are generally reliable, with no widespread critical failures noted. Prospective buyers should consider these potential repair costs when evaluating a 2017 Stelvio.
