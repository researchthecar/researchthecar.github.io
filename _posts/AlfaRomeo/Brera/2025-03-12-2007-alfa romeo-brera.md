The 2007 Alfa Romeo Brera is a stylish grand tourer available as a coupe. It boasts Italian design flair and sporty handling, making it a desirable car for enthusiasts. However, potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine options for the 2007 Brera include the 2.2 JTS inline-4 (185 hp, 169 lb-ft torque) and the 3.2 JTS V6 (260 hp, 239 lb-ft torque). Transmission choices typically consist of a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic (Selespeed in some markets). What people love about the Brera is its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and engaging driving experience. The downsides often cited include potential reliability concerns, higher running costs, and limited rear passenger space.

**Engine**

**2.2 JTS Inline-4**
* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup or when idling. This indicates wear or stretching of the timing chain, which can lead to incorrect valve timing and potential engine damage. Engine may also run rough or have reduced power.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. It's also recommended to inspect the camshaft sprockets for wear.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 2.2 JTS engine is known for relatively high oil consumption. Owners may notice the oil level decreasing significantly between oil changes, requiring frequent top-ups.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and topping up as needed. In some cases, the oil consumption may be reduced by using a higher viscosity oil. In more severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (for oil top-ups) - $3000+ (for engine rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.2 JTS V6**
* **Thermostat Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine overheating or running cooler than normal. The temperature gauge may fluctuate erratically, and the heater may not blow hot air.
    * Solution: Replacement of the thermostat.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Intake Manifold Swirl Flaps**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the intake manifold area, particularly at idle. Loss of power, reduced fuel economy, and potential engine management light illumination. The swirl flaps within the intake manifold can wear out and become loose, causing performance issues and potential damage if they break apart and enter the engine.
    * Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold or removal of the swirl flaps (although this may affect emissions and performance).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, or a high biting point on the clutch pedal. Noises from the clutch area when engaging or disengaging the clutch.
    * Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing. It is often recommended to replace the flywheel at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Selespeed - where applicable)**

* **Selespeed System Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, particularly between 1st and 2nd. Warning lights on the dashboard related to the Selespeed system. The hydraulic pump, actuators, or sensors within the Selespeed system can fail, leading to shifting problems.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the specific fault using diagnostic equipment. Replacement of the faulty component, such as the hydraulic pump, actuator, or sensor. Recalibration of the Selespeed system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Upper Wishbone/Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Knocking or creaking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Vague steering and uneven tire wear. The bushings in the front upper wishbones/control arms are prone to wear, leading to play in the suspension and associated noises.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front upper wishbones/control arms or replacement of the bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to operate correctly, making grinding noises, or falling into the door. The window regulators are known to be weak and prone to failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Central Locking System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Doors failing to lock or unlock with the remote or key. Intermittent operation of the central locking system.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the fault (which could be a faulty door lock actuator, wiring issue, or control module). Repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking (particularly in hot climates)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or use of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (dashboard cover) - $2000+ (dashboard replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system not blowing cold air. Noises from the air conditioning compressor.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air conditioning compressor, receiver drier, and expansion valve. System recharge.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Alfa Romeo Brera is a visually striking car that can provide an enjoyable driving experience. However, it is essential to be aware of the common issues, which can range from relatively minor electrical faults to more significant engine and transmission problems. The 2.2 JTS engine is known for timing chain issues and oil consumption, while the 3.2 JTS V6 can suffer from thermostat and intake manifold problems. Suspension wear and electrical issues (window regulators, central locking) are also relatively common. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the specific fault, but some repairs can be expensive. Careful inspection and a pre-purchase check by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
