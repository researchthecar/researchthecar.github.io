### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Alfa Romeo Brera is a car that prioritizes style and driving pleasure over outright long-term reliability. Owners should be prepared for potential issues, particularly with the diesel engines' DPF and EGR systems, and some electrical components like the infotainment and window regulators. Suspension wear, especially wishbone bushings, is also a common point of attention. While the petrol V6 is generally more robust, the diesel variants present more documented problems. Interior wear, particularly on leather seats, is also a consideration. Despite these potential drawbacks, for those who value its unique design and driving experience, proactive maintenance and awareness of common faults can help mitigate some of these reliability concerns.
