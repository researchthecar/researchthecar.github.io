The 2008 Alfa Romeo Spider is a stylish Italian roadster that offers a unique driving experience. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.2L inline-4 producing approximately 185 horsepower and 169 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.2L V6 generating around 260 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 6-speed manual transmission, while the V6 could also be paired with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Spider's beautiful design, engaging handling, and the sound of the V6 engine.
