The 2003 Alfa Romeo Spider is a stylish and sporty roadster, appreciated for its Italian design and engaging driving experience. It was offered with a 2.0-liter Twin Spark inline-four engine producing around 150 horsepower and 137 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.0-liter V6 engine producing around 192 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, depending on the market. The engine can be paired to either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its open-top driving experience and distinctive styling. However, potential downsides include higher maintenance costs compared to some other roadsters and the relative complexity of its systems.

**Summary:**

The 2003 Alfa Romeo Spider can be a rewarding vehicle to own, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine and transmission issues, particularly with the variator on the 2.0L engine and the 5-speed manual's synchros, can be expensive to fix. Suspension and electrical problems are also frequent concerns. Convertible top issues and interior trim fragility contribute to the overall maintenance burden. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can quickly escalate, making a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic essential. Overall the Alfa Romeo Spider can be a fun car, but requires diligent care and can have above-average ownership costs.
