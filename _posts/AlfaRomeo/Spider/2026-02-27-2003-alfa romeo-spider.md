### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Alfa Romeo Spider, particularly with the V6 engine, is known for its engaging driving experience and distinctive styling. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as oil leaks, particularly on the V6, and potential wear on the Twin Spark engine's camshafts. Transmission reliability can vary, with manual clutches and automatic solenoids being points of concern. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and window regulators, are not uncommon. The convertible top mechanism can also require attention. While not a vehicle for those seeking low-maintenance motoring, addressing these known issues proactively can help maintain the Spider's charm and performance.
