### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Alfa Romeo Spider is a desirable sports car with character, but potential buyers should be aware of its specific reliability quirks. The Twin Spark and V6 engines, while characterful, can suffer from wear-related issues like camshaft problems and oil leaks, and the V6 requires diligent timing belt maintenance. Manual transmissions are generally robust, but clutch wear is common; automatics can develop leaks and solenoid issues. Suspension components like bushings and ball joints are prone to wear, and electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and central locking, are not uncommon. The convertible top mechanism and potential for rust are also key areas to inspect. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the Spider can remain a rewarding car to own.
