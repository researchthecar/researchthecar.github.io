### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Alfa Romeo 159 offers a compelling blend of style and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of its specific reliability quirks. Diesel engines, particularly the 1.9L and 2.4L JTDm, are prone to DPF and EGR issues, while the automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit shifting problems. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and sensor faults, are also noted. Suspension components, specifically front wishbone bushings, may require attention. While the petrol engines and manual transmissions are generally more robust, a thorough pre-purchase inspection and a commitment to regular, specialized maintenance are highly recommended to ensure a satisfying ownership experience.
