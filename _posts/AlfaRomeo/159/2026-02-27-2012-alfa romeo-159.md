### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Alfa Romeo 159 offers a compelling blend of style and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of its specific reliability quirks. Diesel variants, particularly the 1.9L and 2.4L JTDm, are prone to DPF and EGR issues, common in many modern diesels. Petrol engines, especially the TBi, can experience turbocharger-related problems. Automatic transmissions may develop leaks or solenoid issues. Electrically, the Body Control Module and various sensors are known weak points. While suspension components like wishbone bushings can wear, and interior electronics like the Blue & Me system can be temperamental, these are often manageable with informed maintenance. Overall, the 159 requires a more attentive owner than some rivals, but for those who appreciate its character, the rewards can be significant.
