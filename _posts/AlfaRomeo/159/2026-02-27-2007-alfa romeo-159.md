### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Alfa Romeo 159 offers a compelling blend of style and driving pleasure, but potential buyers should be aware of its reliability profile. Diesel variants, particularly the 2.4L, are prone to DPF and EGR issues, while petrol engines can suffer from timing chain or belt problems. Transmission reliability is generally average, with manual clutches and automatic gear selection being common wear points. Suspension components like wishbone bushings and rear springs may require attention. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and sensors, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior climate control systems may develop faults. Proactive maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended for this model.
