### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Alfa Romeo 159 offers a compelling blend of style and driving pleasure, but potential owners should be aware of its reliability quirks. Diesel variants, particularly the 1.9L and 2.4L JTDm, are more prone to issues related to the DPF and EGR systems, which can be costly to repair. The Q-Tronic automatic transmission may also experience occasional gear selection problems. On the electrical front, BCM glitches and sensor failures are not uncommon. Suspension components, specifically front wishbone bushings, can wear prematurely. While petrol engines and manual transmissions generally fare better, proactive maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended to mitigate potential repair costs and ensure a more enjoyable ownership experience.
