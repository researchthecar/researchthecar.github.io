**Summary**

The 2007 Alfa Romeo 159, while praised for its style and driving experience, is prone to several common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around engine timing chain problems (particularly in the 2.2 JTS), swirl flap failures in both petrol and diesel engines, and bearing failures in the M32 manual gearbox. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor electrical issues to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission overhauls. Overall, while the 159 offers a unique and attractive package, buyers should factor in the potential for higher-than-average maintenance costs.
