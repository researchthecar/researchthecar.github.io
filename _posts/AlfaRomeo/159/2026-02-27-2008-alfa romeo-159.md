### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Alfa Romeo 159 offers a compelling blend of style and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of its reliability profile. Diesel variants, particularly the 1.9L and 2.4L JTDm, are prone to DPF and EGR issues, common in many modern diesels. Petrol engines have fewer widespread issues, though the 2.2L JTS can suffer from timing chain problems. Transmission reliability is generally decent, with manual clutches being a wear item and automatics occasionally experiencing fluid leaks or solenoid faults. Suspension components like wishbone bushings and shock absorbers can require replacement. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and various sensors, are also reported. Overall, the 159 requires attentive maintenance and a willingness to address specific common faults to ensure a positive ownership experience.
