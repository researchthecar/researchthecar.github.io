**Introduction:**

The 1992 Alfa Romeo 164 is an executive sedan that was known for its stylish design, luxurious interior, and impressive performance. It was powered by a variety of engines, including a 2.0-liter Twin Spark engine producing 148 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 187 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter V6 engine producing 162 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners praised the car's handling, braking, and comfort, but criticized its reliability.

* **Water pump failure:** The water pump can fail, leading to coolant leaks and overheating. Replacement of the water pump and labor costs around $400 - $600+.

**2.5-liter V6**

* **Ignition coil failure:** The ignition coils can fail, causing misfires, reduced engine performance, and increased fuel consumption. Replacement of the ignition coils costs around $200 - $400+.
* **Exhaust manifold gasket failure:** The exhaust manifold gasket can fail, causing exhaust leaks and decreased engine performance. Replacement of the gasket and labor costs around $300 - $500+.
* **Oxygen sensor failure:** The oxygen sensor can fail, leading to incorrect fuel mixture and reduced engine efficiency. Replacement of the oxygen sensor costs around $200 - $400+.

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out over time, causing slipping, difficulty shifting, and eventual failure. Replacement of the clutch and labor costs around $1000 - $2000+.
* **Shift linkage problems:** The shift linkage may loosen or wear out, causing difficulty shifting gears. Adjustment or replacement of the shift linkage costs around $200 - $400+.
* **Transmission mount failure:** The transmission mounts can fail, causing the transmission to move excessively and potentially damage other components. Replacement of the mounts and labor costs around $300 - $500+.

**4-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip when shifting gears, causing hesitation, delayed acceleration, and reduced engine power. Repair involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission, which costs around $2000 - $4000+.
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing shuddering, slipping, and overheating. Replacement of the torque converter and labor costs around $1500 - $2500+.
* **Valve body malfunction:** The valve body can malfunction, leading to shift problems, delayed engagement, and other transmission issues. Replacement of the valve body and labor costs around $1000 - $2000+.

**Suspension**

* **Strut/shock absorber wear:** The struts and shock absorbers can wear out over time, leading to decreased ride comfort, reduced handling, and premature tire wear. Replacement of the struts/shocks and labor costs around $600 - $1200+.
* **Control arm bushing failure:** The control arm bushings can fail, causing clunking noises, reduced handling, and excessive tire wear. Replacement of the bushings and labor costs around $300 - $600+.
* **Sway bar link failure:** The sway bar links can fail, leading to clunking noises, reduced handling, and premature tire wear. Replacement of the links and labor costs around $200 - $400+.

**Electrical**

* **Battery failure:** The battery can fail over time, causing difficulty starting the vehicle or complete electrical failure. Replacement of the battery costs around $100 - $200+.
* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, leading to insufficient charging of the battery and potential electrical problems. Replacement of the alternator and labor costs around $500 - $800+.
* **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, preventing the vehicle from starting. Replacement of the starter and labor costs around $300 - $500+.
