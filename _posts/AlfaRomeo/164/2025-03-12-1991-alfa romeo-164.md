The 1991 Alfa Romeo 164 is a stylish and sporty Italian sedan that offered a unique blend of performance and luxury for its time. Engine options included a 2.0L Twin Spark inline-four cylinder, a 3.0L V6, and a turbocharged 2.0L inline-four cylinder. The 3.0L V6, found in the 164S, produced around 200 horsepower and 189 lb-ft of torque. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, with a four-speed automatic transmission available on some models. Enthusiasts often praise the 164 for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and engaging driving dynamics. However, potential owners should be aware that Alfa Romeos of this era are known for electrical gremlins and potential maintenance costs associated with their complex engineering.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the timing belt fails, the engine is an interference design, meaning the valves can collide with the pistons. This can cause significant engine damage, including bent valves, damaged pistons, and potentially a cracked cylinder head. Symptoms include sudden engine stalling, a loud clatter from within the engine, or an inability to start.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended service interval (typically every 30,000-60,000 miles). If the timing belt has already failed, the engine needs to be disassembled, inspected, and repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets are common as the gaskets age and harden. Symptoms include oil puddles under the car, a burning oil smell, and visible oil around the valve covers.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Twin Spark Inline-Four**

* **Variator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The variator is part of the variable valve timing system. If it fails, the engine may run rough, have reduced power, and poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replace the variator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Five-Speed Manual**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The synchros, particularly in 2nd gear, can wear out over time, leading to difficulty shifting into gear, grinding noises during shifts, or popping out of gear.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission, including replacing worn synchros.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic transmission can experience slipping between gears, delayed shifting, or erratic shift patterns. This is often due to worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service, including flushing the fluid and replacing the filter. If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (service) - $3000+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Self-Leveling Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 164 models were equipped with a self-leveling rear suspension. This system can fail due to worn-out hydraulic struts, a failing hydraulic pump, or leaks in the hydraulic lines. Symptoms include a sagging rear end, a bumpy ride, or a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty components, such as the hydraulic struts, pump, or lines. It is often more cost-effective to convert to a standard suspension setup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Bushings and Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings and ball joints can wear out over time, leading to loose handling, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings and ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Grounding Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Alfa Romeos of this era are known for their grounding issues. Poor grounding can cause a variety of electrical problems, including intermittent lighting, malfunctioning gauges, and starting problems.
    *   Solution: Clean and tighten all grounding points throughout the car. Add additional ground straps if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as the coolant temperature sensor, mass airflow sensor, and crankshaft position sensor, can fail, leading to poor engine performance, stalling, or a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power window motors can fail, preventing the windows from going up or down.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can be a significant problem, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Common rust areas include the wheel wells, rocker panels, and floor pans.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Treat affected areas with rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Headlight Switch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headlight switch is known to have issues and malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replace the headlight switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The climate control system can be complex and prone to issues. Common problems include a malfunctioning compressor, a leaking evaporator, or a faulty control panel.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific problem and repair or replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks over time due to exposure to sunlight and heat.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+

**Summary:**

The 1991 Alfa Romeo 164 is a charming but potentially troublesome classic. The most significant issues revolve around electrical problems, engine maintenance (especially the timing belt on the V6), and rust. While some repairs may be relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission overhauls or rust repair, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be prepared for regular maintenance and potential repairs and factor this into their purchasing decision.
