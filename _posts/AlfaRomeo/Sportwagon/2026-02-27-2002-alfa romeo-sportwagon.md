### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Alfa Romeo Sportwagon offers a compelling blend of style and utility, but potential buyers should be aware of its reliability quirks. Engines, particularly the Twin Spark petrol variants, can be prone to issues like camshaft wear and ignition coil failures. Diesel engines, while generally more robust, can suffer from turbocharger and EGR valve problems. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, may require attention to clutch components or torque converter issues. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module, are not uncommon. Suspension components like bushings can wear, and rust can be a concern on older examples. While not without its challenges, diligent maintenance and addressing known issues can help keep this stylish Italian wagon on the road.
