The 2012 Alfa Romeo Mito is a stylish and sporty supermini known for its distinctive Italian design and engaging driving experience. Engine options included a range of petrol and diesel engines, with the most common being the 1.4-liter MultiAir petrol engine, available in various states of tune. Other engines included the 1.3-liter and 1.6-liter JTDM diesel engines, as well as a less common 1.4-liter Turbo petrol. Transmission options were primarily a 5- or 6-speed manual, and a 6-speed TCT (Twin Clutch Transmission) automatic, depending on the engine. The 1.4-liter MultiAir engine, in its 135 bhp form, produces around 152 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Mito for its sharp handling, stylish looks, and relatively economical running costs. However, criticisms often include concerns about reliability, particularly electrical issues, and the relatively firm ride.
