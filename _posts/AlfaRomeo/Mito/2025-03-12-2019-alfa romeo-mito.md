The 2019 Alfa Romeo Mito is a stylish supermini known for its sporty handling and distinctive Italian design. Engine options for the 2019 Mito included the 0.9L TwinAir Turbo petrol engine producing 85 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, the 1.4L MultiAir Turbo petrol engine producing 140 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and the 1.3L JTDM diesel engine producing 95 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 6-speed TCT (Twin Clutch Transmission) automatic depending on the engine. Owners often praise the Mito for its sharp steering, attractive styling, and relatively affordable price point. Conversely, criticisms often include the firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and concerns about reliability.

**Engine**

**0.9L TwinAir Turbo**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 0.9L TwinAir engine is known for excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored and topped up regularly. Symptoms include the oil warning light illuminating, smoky exhaust, and a noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Regularly check and top up the oil. Consider switching to a higher viscosity oil. If the problem persists, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L MultiAir Turbo**

*   **MultiAir Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MultiAir unit, which controls valve timing, is prone to failure. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idling, reduced power, and potential engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty MultiAir unit. It's crucial to diagnose correctly, as other issues can mimic these symptoms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.3L JTDM Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Short journeys can prevent the DPF from regenerating properly, leading to clogging and reduced performance. Symptoms include a DPF warning light, reduced power, and potentially a limp mode.
    *   Solution: Perform a forced DPF regeneration (either by driving at higher speeds for an extended period or using a diagnostic tool). If the DPF is severely clogged, it may require cleaning or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for forced regeneration), $500 - $1500+ (for DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**
No Issues Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear and slippage, especially under hard driving conditions. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, a high biting point, and a burning smell.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and possibly the flywheel.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed TCT (Twin Clutch Transmission)**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit, which controls the TCT transmission's shifting, can experience failures. This can cause jerky shifting, delayed engagement, failure to shift, or getting stuck in a gear. Error codes related to solenoids or pressure sensors might also be present.
    *   Solution: The mechatronic unit needs to be replaced or rebuilt. A software update might also be recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn front suspension bushings can cause knocking noises, imprecise steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings. Replacing the entire control arm may be more cost-effective in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dashboard Warning Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spurious or intermittent illumination of various dashboard warning lights, often without an apparent underlying issue. This can range from ABS and airbag lights to engine management lights.
    *   Solution: Requires a thorough diagnostic scan to identify the root cause. Could be a faulty sensor, wiring issue, or a software glitch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The door handles, particularly the exterior driver's side handle, are prone to breakage or malfunction, making it difficult to open the door.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty door handle assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may experience freezes, slow response times, and connectivity issues (Bluetooth, USB).
    *   Solution: Try a software update or reset the system. If the problem persists, the unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $500+ (for unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Alfa Romeo Mito, while appealing in terms of style and handling, does present some potential reliability concerns. Engine issues, particularly excessive oil consumption in the TwinAir engine and MultiAir unit failures in the 1.4L MultiAir Turbo, are relatively common and can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially within the TCT automatic, can also lead to significant expenses. Suspension and electrical faults, while less severe, can still be frustrating. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, ensuring thorough inspection and maintenance history review.
