### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Alfa Romeo MiTo presents a mixed reliability profile. While its exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential owners should be aware of specific engine and transmission concerns. The TwinAir and MultiAir engines, while offering good performance, can be prone to issues like turbocharger failure and MultiAir unit problems, respectively. Diesel variants may encounter DPF issues. The Dualogic automated manual transmission has also seen reports of actuator failures. Manual transmissions are generally more robust but clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, can also occur. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring a more reliable ownership experience.
