### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Alfa Romeo MiTo presents a mixed reliability profile. The petrol engines, particularly the TwinAir and MultiAir variants, can be prone to specific component failures like turbochargers and the MultiAir unit, respectively. Diesel models may encounter DPF issues, common in many modern diesels. Transmission reliability is generally fair, though clutch wear on manuals and potential actuator problems on the Dualogic automatic are noted. Suspension components like bushings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also reported. Exterior and interior components are generally robust with no widespread critical failures documented. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and ensure regular maintenance, especially for the more complex engine and transmission systems.
