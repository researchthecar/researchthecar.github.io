### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Alfa Romeo MiTo presents a mixed reliability profile. The petrol MultiAir engine can be prone to issues with its namesake unit, while diesel variants may encounter problems with the DPF and turbocharger, common concerns for modern diesels. The TCT automatic transmission, while offering convenience, has a higher potential for costly mechatronic or actuator failures compared to the more robust manual gearbox. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are also noted. Beyond these specific points, the suspension, exterior, and interior generally hold up well, with no widespread critical failures reported. Prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for higher maintenance costs, especially with the TCT transmission and diesel particulate filter systems.
