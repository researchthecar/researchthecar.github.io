Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2015 Alfa Romeo Mito, organized by category and engine/transmission type. The 2015 Alfa Romeo Mito is a stylish and sporty subcompact hatchback known for its Italian flair and agile handling. Engine options vary depending on the market but typically include turbocharged petrol and diesel engines. The 1.4L MultiAir Turbo petrol engine, a popular choice, produces around 135 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Mito's distinctive design, engaging driving experience, and relatively good fuel economy. However, common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system and some engine components, as well as concerns about parts availability and higher maintenance costs compared to mainstream competitors.

**Engine**

**1.4L MultiAir Turbo Petrol (135HP)**

*   **MultiAir Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MultiAir system controls valve actuation, and failures can lead to rough running, misfires, loss of power, and the "check engine" light illuminating. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to the MultiAir solenoid or system performance are common.

**Summary**

The 2015 Alfa Romeo Mito, while stylish and fun to drive, is prone to several issues that can lead to significant repair costs. Engine problems (particularly with the MultiAir system and turbochargers), transmission issues (especially in the TCT dual-clutch models), and electrical gremlins are the most concerning. Suspension wear and interior trim issues are also common. While not all Mitos will experience all of these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in higher maintenance costs when considering purchasing this vehicle. Severity of the issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially reaching thousands of dollars.
