The 2018 Alfa Romeo Mito is a stylish subcompact hatchback known for its sporty handling and Italian flair. Engine options for the 2018 model year include a 1.4-liter turbocharged MultiAir inline-4 engine, offered in various states of tune. For example, the 1.4L Turbo MultiAir produces around 135 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, or higher states of tune can produce 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (TCT). Owners generally appreciate the Mito's distinctive design and agile driving dynamics, but some dislike its limited rear passenger space and potentially higher maintenance costs compared to more mainstream competitors.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbo MultiAir (135 hp/150 lb-ft)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, engine running rough, and blue smoke coming from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Check the PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve and the turbocharger. A faulty PCV valve can cause excessive crankcase pressure and oil consumption. A leaking turbocharger can also contribute to this issue. If those components are operating correctly, then an engine rebuild may be required if piston rings are the cause of the oil consumption.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (PCV Valve), $800 - $2000+ (Turbocharger), $3000+ (Engine Rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **MultiAir Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The MultiAir system, which controls valve timing and lift, can experience actuator failures. Symptoms include rough idling, reduced engine power, and the check engine light illuminating. Error codes can indicate a faulty actuator.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty MultiAir actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Description/Symptoms: The MultiAir system, which controls valve timing and lift, can experience actuator failures. Symptoms include rough idling, reduced engine power, and the check engine light illuminating. Error codes can indicate a faulty actuator.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty MultiAir actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (TCT)**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 6-speed TCT transmission, including rough or jerky shifting, hesitation during acceleration, and occasional clunking noises. This is more pronounced at low speeds.
    * Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. Perform a transmission adaptation reset using diagnostic equipment. If the problem persists, the transmission may require a software update or internal repairs, potentially including replacing the clutch packs or valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Fluid Check/Top-Up), $100 - $300 (Adaptation Reset), $1500 - $4000+ (Transmission Repair/Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission's shifting functions, can fail. Symptoms can include difficulty shifting gears, transmission going into limp mode, and error codes related to the transmission control system.
    * Solution: Replace the Mechatronic unit. This often requires specialized tools and knowledge.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, particularly in the front suspension. Symptoms include knocking or squeaking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps, and vague steering.
    * Solution: Replace the worn bushings. It's often recommended to replace multiple bushings at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported glitches and freezes with the infotainment system. Symptoms can include unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and navigation system errors.
    * Solution: Try a system reset. Check for software updates. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (System Reset), $0 - $100 (Software Update), $500 - $1500+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures (ABS, Wheel Speed)**
    * Description/Symptoms: ABS and wheel speed sensors are prone to failure. Symptoms include the ABS light illuminating, traction control system malfunctioning, and speedometer errors.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor and replace it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Condensation can build up inside the headlight housings, affecting visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs and electrical components.
    * Solution: Remove the headlight housings and dry them out thoroughly. Check the seals and vents for damage and replace them if necessary. Applying sealant to the seams may help prevent future condensation.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (Seal/Vent Replacement & Sealing)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking can appear on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: The dashboard can be repaired using specialized repair kits or replaced entirely.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 (Repair), $1000+ (Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Alfa Romeo Mito, while stylish and fun to drive, can suffer from several issues. Engine problems include excessive oil consumption and MultiAir actuator failures. The TCT transmission can exhibit rough shifting and, in more severe cases, mechatronic unit failure. Suspension bushing wear is also a common complaint. Electrical issues, such as infotainment system glitches and sensor failures, and minor exterior and interior issues may also occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the condition of the car.
