### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Alfa Romeo MiTo presents a mixed reliability picture. While its engines, particularly the MultiAir petrol units, can be prone to specific component failures like the MultiAir unit itself, and diesel variants may encounter DPF issues, these are often addressable with specialized knowledge. Transmission reliability varies, with manual clutches being a wear item and the Dualogic automatic requiring careful maintenance to avoid costly hydraulic or actuator problems. Suspension components like wishbone bushings can wear, leading to noise. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or sensors, are also a possibility. Exterior and interior components generally hold up well, with no widespread critical failures reported. Prospective buyers should factor in potential repair costs for the known engine and electrical issues.
