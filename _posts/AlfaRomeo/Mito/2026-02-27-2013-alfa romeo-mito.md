### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Alfa Romeo MiTo presents a mixed reliability profile. While its engines, particularly the MultiAir variants, can be prone to specific unit failures (MultiAir unit, turbocharger), and the Dualogic transmission has known actuator issues, many owners report satisfaction with the manual gearbox. Suspension components like bushings can wear, and electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and parasitic drain, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, the MiTo requires diligent maintenance and a willingness to address potential Italian-specific quirks. Prospective buyers should factor in potential repair costs for the noted components.
