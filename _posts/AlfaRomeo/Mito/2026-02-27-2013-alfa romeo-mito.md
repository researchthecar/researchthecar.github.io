### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Alfa Romeo MiTo presents a mixed reliability picture. While its engines, particularly the MultiAir variants, can be prone to specific component failures like the MultiAir unit itself, and diesel models may face DPF and EGR issues, these are often addressable with specialized knowledge. Transmissions, especially the Dualogic automated manual, can be a source of significant expense if actuators fail. Electrical gremlins and minor exterior/interior issues are also noted. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls and factor in the cost of specialized maintenance, particularly for the more complex engine and transmission options.
