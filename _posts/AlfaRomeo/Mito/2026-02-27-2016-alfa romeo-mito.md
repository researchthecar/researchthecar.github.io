### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Alfa Romeo MiTo presents a mixed reliability profile. While its design and driving experience are strong points, potential buyers should be mindful of specific issues, particularly with the TwinAir and MultiAir engines, and the Dualogic transmission. Diesel variants may encounter DPF and EGR problems common to modern diesels. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM glitches and battery drain, can also occur. The manual gearbox, particularly the M32, is known for bearing wear. Suspension, exterior, and interior components generally fare better, with no widespread critical failures reported. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential reliability concerns.
