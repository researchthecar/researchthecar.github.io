### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Alfa Romeo MiTo presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the TwinAir and MultiAir variants, can be prone to specific component failures like turbocharger issues and MultiAir unit problems, respectively. Diesel engines may encounter DPF and EGR issues common to modern diesels. The manual transmission, especially the M32 gearbox, is known for bearing wear, while the Dualogic automatic can suffer from actuator failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior generally hold up well with no widespread reported issues. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential mechanical and electrical weak points and factor in potential repair costs.
