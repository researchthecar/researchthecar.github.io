The 2016 Alfa Romeo Mito is a stylish and sporty subcompact hatchback, known for its distinctive Italian design and engaging driving experience. The 2016 model year offered various engine options. The 1.4L MultiAir Turbo petrol engine, producing around 135-170 horsepower and 150-184 lb-ft of torque (depending on the trim), is a common choice and will be focused on here. Other engine options included a 1.3L JTDM diesel and a smaller 0.9L TwinAir petrol engine. Transmission options generally included a 5- or 6-speed manual and a 6-speed TCT (Twin Clutch Transmission) automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often appreciate the Mito's unique styling, nimble handling, and relatively fuel-efficient engines. Common dislikes include the sometimes firm ride, occasional reliability concerns, and limited rear passenger space.
