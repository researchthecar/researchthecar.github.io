### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia, while a compelling driver's car, exhibits some common first-year model issues, particularly concerning its turbocharged engines and the electronic systems. Owners may encounter issues related to turbocharger performance, oil leaks, and infotainment system glitches. The transmission, while generally robust, can sometimes exhibit less-than-smooth shifting. However, the suspension and exterior/interior components appear to be relatively solid, with no widespread critical failures reported.
