The 2019 Alfa Romeo Giulia is a stylish and sporty sedan known for its engaging driving dynamics and Italian flair. It came with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 280 horsepower and 306 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.9L twin-turbocharged V6 producing 505 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque exclusively in the Quadrifoglio trim. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Giulia's sharp handling, powerful engines, and distinctive design. Common criticisms include concerns about reliability, electrical quirks, and the infotainment system's usability.
