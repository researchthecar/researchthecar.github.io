The 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia marked the brand's return to the compact executive sedan market, aiming to compete with established players like BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The standard engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 280 horsepower and 306 lb-ft of torque. A higher-performance Quadrifoglio model is available with a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V6 engine. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Giulia is praised for its sharp handling, sporty driving dynamics, and distinctive Italian styling. Criticisms often include concerns about reliability, electrical gremlins, and a less refined interior compared to its German rivals.
