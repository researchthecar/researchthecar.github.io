**Introduction:**

The 2021 Alfa Romeo Giulia is a compact luxury sports sedan that offers a refined driving experience with responsive handling and a potent engine. It comes with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-four with 280 horsepower and 306 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.9L twin-turbocharged V6 with 505 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include an 8-speed automatic for both engines. The Giulia is praised for its stylish design, exhilarating performance, and upscale interior, but some owners have reported issues with certain components.

* **Water Pump Failure:** The water pump may fail, resulting in coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage. Replacement of the water pump is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**2.9L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

* **Fuel Injector Issues:** Faulty fuel injectors can cause engine misfires, rough idling, and performance problems. Replacement of the injectors is typically the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Leaks may develop in the transmission fluid lines or seals, causing fluid loss and potential transmission damage. Repair involves replacing or repairing the faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Shifting Problems:** Some owners have reported difficulties with smooth shifting, such as hesitation, slipping, or grinding noises. Transmission software updates or repairs may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
