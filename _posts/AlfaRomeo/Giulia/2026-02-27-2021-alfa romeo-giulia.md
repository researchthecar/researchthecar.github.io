### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Alfa Romeo Giulia offers an engaging driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of certain reliability concerns. The 2.0L turbo engine can experience turbocharger issues and oil leaks, while the Quadrifoglio's 2.9L V6 may face engine mount and coolant leak problems. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, and minor exterior paint imperfections have also been noted. Interior wear on leather components is also a possibility over time. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these issues suggest that proactive maintenance and a willingness to address specific component failures are important for Giulia owners.
