### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Alfa Romeo Giulia offers an engaging driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of certain reliability concerns. The 2.0L turbo engine can experience turbocharger issues and oil leaks, while the high-performance 2.9L V6 in the Quadrifoglio variant may face engine mount and coolant leak problems. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components, particularly bushings and active dampers, are also noted areas for potential wear. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are reported. Exterior paint quality and interior trim rattles can detract from the premium feel. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these issues suggest that diligent maintenance and a willingness to address specific component failures are important for Giulia owners.
