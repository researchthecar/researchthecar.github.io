The 2022 Alfa Romeo Giulia is a compact luxury sedan celebrated for its sporty handling, stylish Italian design, and engaging driving experience. The Giulia's strengths lie in its sharp steering, athletic chassis, and distinctive aesthetics. However, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential drawbacks. Common criticisms often revolve around reliability concerns, infotainment system quirks, and a smaller dealer network compared to some competitors. The 2022 Giulia is primarily offered with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 280 horsepower and 306 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. There is also the Quadrifoglio, which is not the focus of this response.
