Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues reported for the 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options.

The 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia is a stylish and sporty compact luxury sedan known for its sharp handling and distinctive Italian design. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 280 horsepower and 306 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 producing 505 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque (Giulia Quadrifoglio). Both engines were paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. What people like about the Giulia is its engaging driving experience, striking looks, and powerful engine options. Some common dislikes include reported reliability issues, infotainment system quirks, and a relatively small dealer network.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia, while praised for its driving dynamics and styling, can be prone to certain reliability issues. Engine problems, particularly coolant loss and HPFP failure in the 2.0L turbo and turbocharger failures and oil leaks in the Quadrifoglio, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, electrical glitches, and suspension wear are also common concerns. While some issues may be minor and easily resolved, others can be more severe, leading to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic experienced with Alfa Romeo vehicles.
