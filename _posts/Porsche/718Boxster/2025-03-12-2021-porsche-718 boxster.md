The 2021 Porsche 718 Boxster is a mid-engine roadster lauded for its sharp handling, driver engagement, and stylish design. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged flat-four producing 300 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L turbocharged flat-four making 350 hp and 309 lb-ft of torque (Boxster S), and a 4.0L naturally aspirated flat-six generating 394 hp and 309 lb-ft of torque (Boxster GTS 4.0) or 414 hp and 309 lb-ft of torque (Boxster Spyder/GT4). Transmission choices are a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Common praises for the Boxster include its balanced chassis, responsive steering, and potent engine options. Criticisms often revolve around the four-cylinder engine's sound, some interior material choices, and the relatively high price point.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Flat-Four**
*   **No Issues Found**

**2.5L Turbocharged Flat-Four**
*   **No Issues Found**

**4.0L Naturally Aspirated Flat-Six**
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. The exact cause is not always clear, but it has been attributed to a combination of factors, including the engine's design and driving style.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and adhering to Porsche's recommended oil change intervals are advised. In some cases, a Porsche dealer may perform an oil consumption test to determine if consumption is within acceptable limits or if further investigation is needed. Some owners have sought warranty claims for possible engine defects.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: The cost of addressing excessive oil consumption can vary significantly depending on the root cause. If a major engine repair or replacement is necessary, costs could reach upwards of $10,000 or more.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**
*   **No Issues Found**

**7-Speed PDK (Dual-Clutch Automatic)**
*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of rough shifting, particularly at lower speeds, and occasional hesitation when accelerating from a stop. The PDK transmission is known for its generally smooth and quick shifts, but occasional quirks have been noted.
    * Solution: A PDK adaptation reset and software update by a Porsche dealer may resolve some shifting issues. In more severe cases, component replacement within the PDK unit might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: A PDK adaptation reset and software update can range from $200 - $500. If component replacement is needed within the PDK unit, costs can vary widely depending on the parts required, potentially reaching $3,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**
* **PASM Damper Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) dampers, resulting in a loss of damping control and a noticeably degraded ride quality. This can manifest as excessive bouncing, instability over bumps, or unusual noises from the suspension.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed PASM damper(s). It's often recommended to replace dampers in pairs (front or rear) to ensure balanced suspension performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ per pair, depending on labor rates and whether OEM or aftermarket parts are used.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine or requiring a jump-start.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws, such as aftermarket accessories or malfunctioning electronic modules that are draining power when the car is off. A battery tender can help maintain the battery's charge during periods of inactivity. In some cases, a replacement battery may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ for a new battery and diagnostic testing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**
*   **Air Conditioning Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the air conditioning system not blowing cold air consistently or failing to operate properly. This may be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or other issues within the A/C system.
    *   Solution: A professional A/C system diagnosis to identify the source of the problem. Repairing or replacing the faulty components, such as the compressor, condenser, or refrigerant lines, and recharging the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+, depending on the specific issue and the parts that need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Porsche 718 Boxster is a well-regarded sports car, but some owners have experienced issues. Most issues appear to be relatively minor. However, the 4.0L flat-six engines have been shown to have excessive oil consumption issues. A notable suspension issue involves premature PASM damper failure, which can be relatively costly to repair. Electrical problems, such as battery drain, are also reported. Finally, interior issues involving the air conditioning system have been mentioned. The potential costs of these repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for more extensive work.
