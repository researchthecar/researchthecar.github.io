The 2017 Porsche 718 Boxster is a mid-engine roadster that offers a thrilling driving experience. The base model comes equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-four engine producing 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, mated to either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. Higher trims feature a more powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-four. Owners typically praise the Boxster's sharp handling, responsive engine, and stylish design. Common complaints revolve around the somewhat controversial engine sound compared to the previous flat-six models, as well as the limited storage space.
