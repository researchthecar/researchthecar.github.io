**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Flat-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**2.5L Turbocharged Flat-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**4.0L Naturally Aspirated Flat-6**

*   **Oil starvation during track use (specifically Spyder RS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine failure, excessive oil consumption, knocking noises. This issue is more prevalent in track environments due to the extreme cornering forces.
    *   Solution: Porsche has issued a recall for reprogramming the ECU. The latest software should prevent oil starvation. Installing a high-quality aftermarket baffled oil pan and Accusump system or using high viscosity oil is also beneficial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Accusump kits run between $500 - $1500+, ECU reflash is generally free. Baffled Oil Pan $1,000 - $3,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**7-Speed PDK**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Low-Speed Maneuvers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the PDK exhibiting hesitation or jerking, particularly when shifting at low speeds or during parking maneuvers.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, replacement of the PDK unit or specific components within it may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update may be covered under warranty. PDK unit replacement can range from $10,000 - $15,000+.

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system, responsible for infotainment and navigation, occasionally freezes or crashes.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealership usually resolves this. Some owners report that a hard reset (disconnecting the battery briefly) can also temporarily fix the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are usually free under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **False Low Tire Pressure Warning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sometimes gives false low-pressure warnings, even when tire pressures are within the correct range.
    *   Solution: Resetting the TPMS system via the PCM may temporarily resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the TPMS sensors may need to be inspected and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: TPMS sensor replacement $100 - $300 per sensor.
