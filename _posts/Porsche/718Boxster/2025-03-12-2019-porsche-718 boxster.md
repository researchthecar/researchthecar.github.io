The 2019 Porsche 718 Boxster is a mid-engine roadster praised for its sharp handling, responsive steering, and overall driving experience. The base model comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-4 engine producing 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-4 producing 350 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque in the S model, and a 4.0-liter naturally aspirated flat-6 producing 394 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque in the GTS model. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic.

The PDK transmission can experience costly Mechatronic unit failures. Suspension issues can arise with the PASM dampers, and electrical problems with the PCM system may occur. Convertible top malfunctions can also require expensive repairs. Overall, while not every car will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of them and have the vehicle inspected, particularly for the PDK transmission and PASM systems, prior to purchase. The cost to repair these issues could range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, making pre-purchase inspection crucial.
