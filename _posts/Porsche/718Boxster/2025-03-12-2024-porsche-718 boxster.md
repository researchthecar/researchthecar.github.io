The 2024 Porsche 718 Boxster is a mid-engine roadster celebrated for its exceptional handling, precise steering, and driver-focused experience. It's available with several engine options, including a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-four producing 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-four producing 350 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0-liter naturally aspirated flat-six generating 394 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque (GTS 4.0) or 493 hp and 331 lb-ft (718 Spyder RS). Transmission options include a six-speed manual and a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the Boxster's agility and engaging driving dynamics but some find the base four-cylinder engine lacks the character of the flat-six and some models, such as the GTS 4.0, command a premium price.
