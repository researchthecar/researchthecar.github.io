The 2022 Porsche 718 Boxster is a mid-engine sports car known for its sharp handling, responsive steering, and engaging driving experience. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-4 producing 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-4 producing 350 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0-liter naturally aspirated flat-6 producing 394-493 horsepower and 309-317 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Common praises include the car's athleticism, communicative chassis, and relatively compact size. Criticisms often involve the turbocharged flat-4's sound (compared to the flat-6) and the limited practicality inherent in a two-seat convertible.
