**Engine**

**5.7L V10**

*   **Camshaft Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature camshaft wear can occur, leading to reduced engine performance, increased valve train noise (ticking), and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of camshafts and followers, along with inspection of the oil system for contaminants.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Titanium Connecting Rod Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Carrera GT utilizes titanium connecting rods, which while lightweight, can be more susceptible to wear and potential fatigue failure over time, particularly with improper maintenance or track use. Symptoms can range from increased engine noise to catastrophic engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the titanium connecting rods with upgraded aftermarket steel connecting rods is a common preventative measure, or replacing them with new OEM titanium rods.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Valve springs can weaken or break, leading to valve float, misfires, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of all valve springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
