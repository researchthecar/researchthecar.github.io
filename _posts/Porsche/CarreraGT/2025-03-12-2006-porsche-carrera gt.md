Engine oil and coolant leaks can occur, and the titanium connecting rods are a known weak point, especially with aggressive driving. The clutch requires a skilled driver and can be expensive to replace, and the transmission can suffer from synchro wear. Suspension dampers can leak, and electrical issues such as battery drain can also arise. Overall, while the Carrera GT offers unparalleled performance, maintenance and repairs can be costly, making pre-purchase inspection and a thorough service history crucial.
