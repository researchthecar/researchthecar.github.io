### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Porsche Panamera is a robust vehicle with a generally good reliability record for its class. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly concerning the engine's timing chain and coolant systems, especially on V6 and V8 models. The PDK transmission can be prone to mechatronics unit failures or clutch wear, while the air suspension on PASM-equipped models may develop leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also noted. While some repairs can be costly, proactive maintenance and addressing early symptoms can mitigate significant problems. Overall, the Panamera offers a compelling luxury performance experience, but potential buyers should factor in the possibility of higher-than-average repair costs for certain components.
