The 2023 Porsche Panamera is a luxury performance sedan/hatchback offering a blend of driving excitement and opulent comfort. Engine options range from a 2.9L twin-turbo V6 to a 4.0L twin-turbo V8 and plug-in hybrid variants. The base 2.9L V6 produces 325 hp and 331 lb-ft of torque. Critics often praise the Panamera's handling, powerful engine options, and luxurious interior. Common dislikes include the high price tag and some complicated infotainment controls. All engines are paired with an 8-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission.

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system, which controls navigation, audio, and vehicle settings, may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can occur randomly or when using specific features.
    *   Solution: A software update from Porsche is typically required to address the underlying software bugs causing the issue. In some cases, a hardware replacement of the PCM unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are generally free at the dealership. PCM unit replacement could range from $1,500 - $3,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can cause starting issues, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. The issue is often attributed to parasitic drain from various electronic modules not shutting down correctly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the module causing the excessive drain. Software updates or replacement of the faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+, depending on the module requiring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Creaking/Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported creaking or rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear hatch area, especially when driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Locating and isolating the source of the noise. This may involve tightening fasteners, applying felt tape to contact points, or replacing worn trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions can occur, including failure to open or close properly, sticking, or excessive noise during operation. In some cases, the sunroof may leak water into the cabin.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the sunroof mechanism, including cleaning and lubricating the tracks, replacing worn components (e.g., seals, motor), or realigning the sunroof panel.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+, depending on the nature of the problem and parts required.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Panamera's optional air suspension can experience problems, including air leaks, compressor failure, or uneven ride height. Warning lights on the dashboard may indicate a fault.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the air suspension system, including checking for leaks, testing the compressor, and inspecting the ride height sensors. Repair may involve replacing the air struts, compressor, or other components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+, depending on the component needing replacement.
