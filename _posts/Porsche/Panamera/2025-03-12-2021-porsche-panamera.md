The 2021 Porsche Panamera is a luxury performance sedan (and wagon - Sport Turismo) offering a blend of comfort, technology, and driving excitement. It's available with a range of powertrains, including a 2.9L Twin-Turbo V6 producing 325 hp and 331 lb-ft of torque, a 4.0L Twin-Turbo V8 producing 473 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque, and various hybrid configurations boosting power even further. The Panamera is generally praised for its handling, powerful engines, and luxurious interior. However, some owners have reported issues with the electronics, air suspension, and certain engine components. Dislikes often center around the high price tag, complicated infotainment system, and the cost of maintenance and repairs. All Panamera models use an 8-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) dual-clutch transmission.
