### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Porsche Panamera offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, with a generally solid reliability record. The V6 engines and Tiptronic transmission are particularly robust. However, owners of V8 models should be aware of potential oil and coolant leaks, which can be costly to repair. The PDK transmission, while offering superior performance, has had documented issues with its mechatronics unit and clutch packs, representing a significant potential expense. Air suspension systems can also develop leaks over time. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are not uncommon. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these specific potential issues, the Panamera can remain a reliable and enjoyable vehicle.
