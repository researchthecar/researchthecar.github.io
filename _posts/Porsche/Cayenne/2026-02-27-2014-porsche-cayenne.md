### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Porsche Cayenne is a well-built luxury SUV with a generally strong reliability record. The most common reported issues tend to be related to the engine (coolant leaks, ignition coils, turbocharger issues on V8 models, DPF/EGR on diesel) and the transmission (fluid leaks, torque converter). Suspension components, particularly air suspension systems, can also require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are not uncommon. While not a high-maintenance vehicle in terms of routine issues, addressing these specific potential problems proactively can ensure continued optimal performance and longevity.
