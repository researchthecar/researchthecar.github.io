### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Porsche Cayenne generally demonstrates good reliability, particularly in its exterior and interior components, which show no widespread issues. The powertrain, while robust, can be prone to specific concerns such as coolant leaks and ignition coil failures in V6 models, and oil leaks or turbocharger issues in V8 variants. Diesel models may encounter DPF or EGR valve problems. Transmission issues are less common but can involve fluid leaks or torque converter faults. Suspension, especially air suspension systems, can develop leaks or sensor issues. Electrical gremlins like battery drain and infotainment glitches are also noted. Overall, the Cayenne is a reliable luxury SUV, but owners should be aware of potential engine and suspension-related repairs, especially as mileage increases.
