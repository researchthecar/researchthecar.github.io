It was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 3.6L V6, 4.8L V8, and 4.5L V8 diesel engine, paired with a 6-speed manual, 6-speed Tiptronic automatic, or 8-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission. Despite its premium appeal, the 2009 Cayenne has encountered some common issues reported by owners.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

Symptoms include rough idling, rattling noises, and engine misfires. The solution involves replacing the timing chain and related components. Estimated cost to fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
* **Coolant leaks:** The coolant reservoir or hoses may develop leaks, leading to overheating problems. Symptoms include a low coolant level warning light and visible coolant leaks. The solution involves replacing the affected components. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $600

**4.8L V8**

* **Intake manifold failure:** The intake manifold can crack, causing a vacuum leak and poor engine performance. Symptoms include rough idling, misfiring, and a check engine light. The solution involves replacing the intake manifold. Estimated cost to fix: $1,200 - $2,000
* **Engine oil leaks:** The camshaft adjuster solenoids or oil cooler lines may leak, causing low oil levels and potential engine damage. Symptoms include visible oil leaks and an oil level warning light. The solution involves replacing the leaking components. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,200

**4.5L V8 Diesel**

* **Engine emissions control system issues:** The diesel particulate filter (DPF) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system may experience problems, leading to poor engine performance and increased emissions. Symptoms include reduced power, exhaust smoke, and a check engine light. The solution involves cleaning or replacing the affected components. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $3,000

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch may wear out prematurely, leading to difficulty shifting gears and a loss of power transmission. Symptoms include slipping, shuddering, and a burning smell. The solution involves replacing the clutch and pressure plate. Estimated cost to fix: $1,200 - $1,800

**6-Speed Tiptronic Automatic**

* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter may experience shuddering or slipping, causing harsh gear changes and loss of power. Symptoms include erratic transmission behavior and a check engine light. The solution involves replacing the torque converter. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,000+

**8-Speed Tiptronic S Automatic**

* **Shifting problems:** Some early models may experience delayed or rough shifting, particularly in low gears. Software updates or transmission servicing may resolve the issue. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500
