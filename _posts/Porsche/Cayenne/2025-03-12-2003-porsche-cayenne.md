The 2003 Porsche Cayenne marked Porsche's entry into the SUV market. Available engine options included a 3.2L VR6 producing 247 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.5L V8 in two variants: the Cayenne S with 340 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, and the Cayenne Turbo with 450 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Cayenne's performance handling capabilities and luxurious interior, but some common complaints include high maintenance costs and potential reliability issues.
