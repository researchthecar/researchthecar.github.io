**Introduction:**
The 2016 Porsche Cayenne is a mid-size luxury SUV that offers a wide range of engine and transmission options. The base model comes with a 3.6-liter V6 engine, while other options include a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6, a 4.8-liter V8, and a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8. The Cayenne can be equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission, an 8-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission, or a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission.

Despite its popularity, some owners have reported issues with their Cayenne. These issues range from minor annoyances to more serious problems.

**Engine**

**3.6-liter V6**

* **Intake Valve Carbon Buildup:** Carbon buildup on the intake valves can reduce engine power and fuel economy. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and reduced power. Cleaning the intake valves is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip and potentially damaging the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, loss of power, and poor fuel economy. Replacing the timing chain and tensioner is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $3,500+.

**3.0-liter Turbocharged V6**

* **Turbocharger Wastegate Failure:** The turbocharger wastegate can fail, causing boost pressure to leak and reducing engine power. Symptoms include reduced power, increased fuel consumption, and a whistling noise from the engine. Replacing the turbocharger is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+.

**4.8-liter V8**

* **Cylinder Bore Scoring:** The cylinder bores in the 4.8-liter V8 engine can score, causing oil consumption and loss of compression. Symptoms include increased oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, and reduced engine power. Reboring the cylinders or replacing the engine is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+.

**Transmission**

**6-speed Manual Transmission**

* **Shift Linkage Issues:** The shift linkage can become loose or worn, causing difficulty shifting gears. Replacing the shift linkage is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500.
* **Synchronizer Failure:** The synchronizers in the transmission can fail, making it difficult or impossible to shift gears. Replacing the transmission is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+.

**8-speed Tiptronic S Automatic Transmission**

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** The mechatronic unit, which controls the automatic transmission, can fail. Symptoms include gear changes that are slow or rough, slipping gears, and loss of power. Replacing the mechatronic unit is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+.
* **Torque Converter Lockup Failure:** The torque converter lockup can fail, causing the transmission to slip and increasing fuel consumption. Replacing the torque converter is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+.

**7-speed PDK Dual-Clutch Transmission**

* **Clutch Pack Failure:** The clutch packs in the PDK transmission can fail, causing the transmission to slip and lose power. Replacing the clutch packs is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+.
* **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** The mechatronic unit, which controls the dual-clutch transmission, can fail. Symptoms include gear changes that are slow or rough, slipping gears, and loss of power. Replacing the mechatronic unit is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+.
