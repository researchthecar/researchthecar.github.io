The 2011 Porsche Cayenne marked the second generation of Porsche's popular SUV, offering a blend of performance, luxury, and practicality. The base model came equipped with a 3.6-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 4.8-liter V8 in the Cayenne S (400 hp, 369 lb-ft), a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 in the Cayenne Turbo (500 hp, 516 lb-ft), and a diesel option. All engines were available with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Cayenne's handling, powerful engines, and luxurious interior. Criticisms frequently focused on the high cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as the complex electronics that could sometimes be problematic.
