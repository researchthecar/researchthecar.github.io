**Summary**

The 2014 Porsche Cayenne, while offering a luxurious driving experience, exhibits several common issues across its various engine and component systems. Engine problems range from coolant leaks and supercharger failures to turbocharger issues and high-pressure fuel pump failures in the diesel variant, depending on the specific engine configuration. Transmission issues with the 8-speed Tiptronic S are also common, with valve body problems leading to shifting issues. Suspension problems, particularly with the air suspension, and electrical issues like battery drain and infotainment system malfunctions, also contribute to potential maintenance costs. The severity and cost of these repairs can be significant, particularly those involving turbochargers, superchargers, or complete air suspension replacements. While the Cayenne offers a desirable blend of performance and luxury, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs.
