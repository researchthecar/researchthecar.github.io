The 2023 Porsche 718 Spyder is a high-performance roadster celebrated for its exceptional handling, powerful engine, and open-air driving experience. It comes exclusively with a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six engine producing 414 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque. It comes with a 6-speed manual transmission only. While adored for its engaging driving dynamics, responsive engine, and classic design, some owners have reported specific issues. This document compiles common issues and complaints reported by owners, categorized by major vehicle components.

**Engine**

**4.0-Liter Flat-Six**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups. The consumption rate can vary, but some report needing to add a quart of oil every 1,000-2,000 miles.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection is recommended to check for leaks or internal engine issues. Sometimes, switching to a different oil viscosity can help. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change and top off) - $10,000+ (engine repair or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The valve can crack and send metal into the engine causing catastrophic engine failure. This issue has been seen across multiple Porsche vehicles with the 4.0 engine including the GT4 and GT3 models.
    * Solution: Replace the engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $30,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Difficulty Shifting into 1st or 2nd Gear When Cold**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report difficulty engaging 1st or 2nd gear, particularly when the engine and transmission are cold. The issue usually improves as the transmission warms up.
    * Solution: Some have found success by using a different transmission fluid. Others have had the dealer adjust the shifter linkage. In more severe cases, internal transmission repairs may be needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (fluid change) - $500 (shifter adjustment) - $3,000+ (transmission repair).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reboot.
    * Solution: Software updates are the most common fix. In some instances, a hardware replacement of the PCM unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (PCM replacement).

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the car is not driven regularly.
    * Solution: Ensure all accessories are turned off when the car is parked. A trickle charger or battery maintainer can help prolong battery life during periods of inactivity. A dealer inspection can identify any parasitic draws.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (trickle charger) - $300 (battery replacement) - $200+ (diagnosis of parasitic draw).
