The 2016 Porsche Cayman is a mid-engine sports car celebrated for its balanced handling, engaging driving dynamics, and distinctive Porsche styling. The base model features a 2.7-liter flat-six engine producing 275 horsepower and 213 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. The Cayman S boasts a 3.4-liter flat-six engine generating 325 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, also available with the same transmission choices. Drivers generally appreciate the Cayman's precise steering, responsive throttle, and overall athleticism. However, some criticisms include the relatively small cargo capacity and the high cost of optional features.
