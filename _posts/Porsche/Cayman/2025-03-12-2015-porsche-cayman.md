The 2015 Porsche Cayman is a mid-engine sports car celebrated for its precise handling, responsive steering, and overall driving experience. Engine options include a 2.7-liter flat-6 producing 275 horsepower and 213 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4-liter flat-6 generating 325 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque in the S model.
