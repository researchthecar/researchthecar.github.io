The 2008 Porsche Cayman is a mid-engine sports car praised for its balanced handling, engaging driving experience, and distinctive Porsche styling. Engine options for this model year include a 2.7L flat-six producing 245 horsepower and 201 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4L flat-six generating 295 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque in the Cayman S. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, or a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Common criticisms include the limited storage space and higher maintenance costs associated with owning a Porsche.

**Summary**

The 2008 Porsche Cayman offers a thrilling driving experience, but like many performance vehicles, it's not without its potential issues. Engine oil leaks and, less frequently, IMS bearing concerns (especially in earlier production years) can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, particularly second gear pop-out in the 6-speed manual, are also something to be aware of. Electrical glitches, such as climate control or instrument cluster failures, can add to the maintenance burden. While many of these issues are not universally experienced, pre-purchase inspections and thorough maintenance records are crucial for potential buyers. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to significant financial investments for repairs.
