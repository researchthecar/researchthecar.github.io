The 2007 Porsche Cayman is a mid-engine sports car known for its exceptional handling and driver engagement. Engine options included a 2.7L flat-6 producing 245 horsepower and 201 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4L flat-6 producing 295 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque in the Cayman S. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual (2.7L only), 6-speed manual, or a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Cayman's balanced chassis, precise steering, and overall driving experience. Common criticisms include limited storage space, a somewhat dated interior, and the potential for costly repairs associated with owning a Porsche.

**Summary**

The 2007 Porsche Cayman, while a desirable sports car, is not without its potential issues. The most significant concern is the IMS bearing failure, which can lead to major engine damage. RMS leaks and oil separator failures are also relatively common and can add to the cost of ownership. Suspension components such as control arm bushings and strut mounts are also prone to wear and can affect handling. While not all Caymans will experience these issues, it is important to be aware of them when considering purchasing one. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine work. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified Porsche mechanic are highly recommended.
