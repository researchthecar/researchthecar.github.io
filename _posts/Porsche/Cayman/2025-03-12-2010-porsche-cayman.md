The 2010 Porsche Cayman is a mid-engine sports car known for its excellent handling and balanced performance. Engine options include a 2.9L flat-6 producing 265 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4L flat-6 producing 320 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque in the Cayman S. Transmission options are a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Drivers often praise the Cayman's precise steering, engaging driving dynamics, and overall build quality. Criticisms sometimes include limited storage space and relatively high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.9L Flat-6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points, including the rear main seal (RMS), valve cover gaskets, and oil cooler. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the location of the leak and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.4L Flat-6 (Cayman S)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.9L, oil leaks can occur from the rear main seal, valve cover gaskets, and oil cooler.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the location of the leak and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intermediate Shaft (IMS) Bearing Failure (Although less common in the 987.2 generation, still a possibility)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A failing IMS bearing can cause metallic debris in the oil, a rattling noise from the engine, and eventually catastrophic engine failure. This is less common on the 987.2 (2009-2012) than previous generations, but is still worth noting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the IMS bearing with an upgraded version is recommended, though labor intensive. Some may also opt to replace the entire engine if significant damage has already occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $6000+ depending on extent of damage and chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Slave Cylinder Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, soft or spongy clutch pedal, clutch pedal sticking to the floor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch slave cylinder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed PDK (Dual-Clutch Automatic)**

*   **PDK Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional hesitation when accelerating, rough or jerky shifts, particularly at low speeds.
    *   Solution: A PDK software update or PDK service (fluid and filter change) may resolve the issue. In some cases, valve body repair/replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (software update) - $3000+ (valve body replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, vague steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Climate Control Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The climate control blower motor stops working, resulting in no air conditioning or heat.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings.
    * Solution: Removing the headlight assembly, drying it out, and resealing the housing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard/Trim Adhesive Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adhesive holding the dashboard leather or trim pieces together may fail, causing separation or delamination.
    *   Solution: Re-gluing the affected areas, or replacing the entire panel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+ depending on the extent of the damage and the chosen repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Porsche Cayman is a generally reliable sports car, but owners may encounter issues such as oil leaks from the engine, particularly in the 2.9L and 3.4L engines. The PDK transmission can experience hesitation or rough shifting. Suspension issues like control arm bushing wear are also fairly common. While IMS bearing failure is less prevalent in this generation, it is still a potential concern, especially in the 3.4L engine. Electrical issues such as blower motor failure can also occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, with estimated costs varying greatly depending on the specific problem and the repair needed.
