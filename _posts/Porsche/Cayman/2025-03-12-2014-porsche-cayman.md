The 2014 Porsche Cayman is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car known for its exceptional handling and engaging driving experience. The base model is equipped with a 2.7-liter flat-six engine producing 275 horsepower and 213 lb-ft of torque. The Cayman S features a 3.4-liter flat-six engine, delivering 325 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) dual-clutch transmission. Many owners praise the Cayman's precise steering, balanced chassis, and overall fun-to-drive nature. Common complaints include limited cargo space, a relatively firm ride, and the high cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**2.7L Flat-Six**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various points on the engine, including the rear main seal and valve cover gaskets. This can lead to oil consumption, a burning smell, and visible oil stains.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. In severe cases, more extensive engine repairs may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the source and severity of the leak.

**3.4L Flat-Six**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.7L engine, the 3.4L can also develop oil leaks from the rear main seal, valve cover gaskets, and other areas. Symptoms include oil consumption, burning smell, and visible leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty seals or gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the source and severity of the leak.

*   **Piston Ring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption. This can be caused by faulty piston rings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings usually resolves the oil consumption issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear or failure can occur, particularly in cars driven aggressively. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch assembly, including the pressure plate, friction disc, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

**7-Speed PDK**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mechatronic unit is the electro-hydraulic control unit for the PDK transmission. Failure of this unit can cause erratic shifting, failure to engage gears, or complete loss of transmission function.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the Mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $7000+

*   **Gear Selection Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties shifting between gears, delayed shifts, or unexpected downshifts can occur.
    *   Solution: PDK adaption/relearn using PIWIS diagnostic tool, fluid change, or replacement of the transmission control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+

**Suspension**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery can drain quickly, especially if it sits unused for extended periods. This can result in difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Identify and address the source of the parasitic drain, which can be caused by faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery. A battery tender can also help maintain the battery's charge during periods of inactivity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors can fail, resulting in a warning light on the dashboard and inaccurate tire pressure readings.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty TPMS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per sensor

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks can occur around the door seals, windows, or sunroof, leading to water intrusion into the cabin.
