Oil leaks are also a possibility, though typically less severe. Transmission reliability is good for both manual and automatic options, with clutch wear being a common maintenance item for manuals. Electrical gremlins are infrequent, with window regulators and occasional headlight condensation being the most cited problems. Overall, the Cayman offers a rewarding ownership experience with a solid foundation, provided potential buyers are aware of and prepared for the possibility of IMS-related repairs.
