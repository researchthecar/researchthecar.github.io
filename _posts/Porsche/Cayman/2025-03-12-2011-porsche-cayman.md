The 2011 Porsche Cayman is a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its sharp handling and engaging driving experience. The base Cayman features a 2.9-liter flat-six engine producing 265 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. The Cayman S boasts a 3.4-liter flat-six engine with 320 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally praise the Cayman's balanced chassis, precise steering, and overall driving dynamics. Common criticisms include a relatively small cargo capacity and some interior components that may feel dated compared to newer vehicles.
