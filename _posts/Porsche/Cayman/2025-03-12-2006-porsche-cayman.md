The 2006 Porsche Cayman is a mid-engine sports car that offers a thrilling driving experience and distinctive styling. The base model comes equipped with a 2.7L flat-six engine producing around 245 horsepower and 201 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful Cayman S variant is also available, featuring a 3.4L flat-six engine that generates approximately 295 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are available with either a 5-speed manual (base Cayman only), a 6-speed manual, or a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Cayman for its precise handling, balanced chassis, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some common complaints include concerns about reliability, particularly with the engine and some electrical components, as well as the relatively high cost of maintenance and repairs.
