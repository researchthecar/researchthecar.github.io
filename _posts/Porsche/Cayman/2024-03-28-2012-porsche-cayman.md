The Porsche Cayman is a mid-engine sports car manufactured by Porsche. It was introduced in 2006 as the successor to the 986 Boxster and is available in both coupe and convertible (Boxster) body styles. For the 2012 model year, the Cayman received a facelift and a number of mechanical updates. It is available with two engine options: a 2.7-liter flat-six with 245 horsepower and a 3.4-liter flat-six with 330 horsepower. Both engines are mated to a six-speed manual or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.
