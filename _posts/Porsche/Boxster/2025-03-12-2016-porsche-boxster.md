The 2016 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster known for its exceptional handling and engaging driving experience. The base model features a 2.7-liter flat-6 engine producing 265 horsepower and 206 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful Boxster S is available with a 3.4-liter flat-6 that makes 315 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the Boxster's precise steering, balanced chassis, and refined interior, but some criticize the relatively small cargo space and the cost of optional features. Some complain that the base engine can feel underpowered compared to the "S" model.

**Summary**

The 2016 Porsche Boxster is generally a reliable sports car, but certain issues can arise. Engine oil leaks and water pump failures are common across both engine options. The PDK transmission can experience hesitation or rough shifting, potentially requiring costly repairs. Suspension issues, particularly with the PASM shocks, can also occur. Electrical problems, such as door lock actuator failures and convertible top issues, are less frequent but can be frustrating. While the severity of these issues varies, the cost of repair, particularly for the PDK and PASM systems, can be significant, underscoring the importance of thorough inspection and maintenance.
