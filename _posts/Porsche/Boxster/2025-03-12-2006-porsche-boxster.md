The 2006 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster that offers a thrilling driving experience. For this model year, the available engine options include a 2.7L flat-six producing around 240 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L flat-six in the Boxster S producing approximately 280 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual (2.7L only), a 6-speed manual, or a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Boxster's balanced handling, responsive steering, and open-air driving experience. Common complaints center around potential maintenance costs, particularly concerning the intermediate shaft (IMS) bearing and other age-related issues.

**Summary**

The 2006 Porsche Boxster offers a great driving experience but has some potential reliability concerns, primarily related to the IMS bearing. Oil leaks, suspension component wear, and electrical issues with the convertible top are also common as the car ages. The IMS bearing issue can be very costly if it leads to engine failure, but preventative maintenance can mitigate this risk. Other repairs tend to be moderately priced, though labor costs can be high due to the car's design. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
