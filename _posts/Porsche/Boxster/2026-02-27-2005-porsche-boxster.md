### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Porsche Boxster (987) is a desirable sports car with a generally good reliability record, especially concerning its transmissions and exterior/interior components. The primary areas of concern revolve around the engine, specifically the potential for Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing failure and rear main seal leaks, which are known issues for this generation of Porsche flat-six engines. These can be costly to repair if they occur. Electrical issues, such as window regulators and headlight switches, are also documented but are typically less severe and expensive to fix than engine problems. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of inspection and possible preventative maintenance, particularly for the IMS bearing.
