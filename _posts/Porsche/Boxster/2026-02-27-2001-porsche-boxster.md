### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Porsche Boxster, while a desirable sports car, presents several potential reliability concerns, primarily centered around its engine and convertible top. The Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing is a well-documented, albeit not universal, failure point that can lead to catastrophic engine damage if it fails. Rear main seal leaks are also common. The convertible top mechanism can be a source of leaks and operational issues. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and ignition switches can also arise. Despite these potential issues, many Boxsters have been well-maintained and can offer an engaging driving experience. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs, especially for the engine and top.
