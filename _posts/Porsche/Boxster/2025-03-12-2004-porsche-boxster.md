The 2004 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster known for its balanced handling and sporty driving experience. The base model came equipped with a 2.7-liter flat-six engine producing 225 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. An "S" model was also available with a larger 3.2-liter flat-six engine, producing 264 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission (2.7L) or a 6-speed manual transmission (3.2L), or a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Boxster for its engaging driving dynamics and iconic Porsche styling, while common complaints include the cost of maintenance and the potential for certain age-related mechanical issues.
