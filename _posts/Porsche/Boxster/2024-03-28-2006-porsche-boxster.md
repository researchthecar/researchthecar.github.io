**Summary:**

The 2006 Porsche Boxster is a capable sports car, but it is not without its issues. The most serious problem is the intermediate shaft bearing failure in the 2.7-liter engine, which can be catastrophic and expensive to fix. Other common issues include the VarioCam adjuster failure in the 3.2-liter engine, torque converter failure in the five-speed automatic transmission, and alternator and battery discharge issues in the electrical system. While many of these issues can be fixed for relatively low cost, the potential for a major engine failure is a significant concern.
