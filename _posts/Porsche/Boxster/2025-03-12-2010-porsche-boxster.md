The 2010 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster offering a thrilling driving experience with precise handling and a stylish design. The base model features a 2.9-liter flat-six engine producing 255 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, with the seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission available as an option. Drivers appreciate the Boxster's responsive steering, balanced chassis, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some owners have reported issues related to engine components, electrical systems, and interior trim.

**Engine**

**2.9L Flat-Six**

*   **Intermediate Shaft (IMS) Bearing Failure (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While less prevalent in the 2009 and later Boxster models due to an updated IMS bearing design, there's still a remote chance of IMS bearing failure, especially in early production 2009 models. Symptoms include metallic shavings in the oil filter, a rattling noise from the engine, or a complete engine seizure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the IMS bearing with an upgraded aftermarket bearing is the preventative fix. If failure has already occurred, a complete engine rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ (Preventative), $10,000+ (Engine Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the rear main seal (RMS), valve cover gaskets, and oil cooler seals. Symptoms include oil spots under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking seals or gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the location of the leak.
