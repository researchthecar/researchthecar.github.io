The 2001 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster that offers a sporty driving experience. The base model comes equipped with a 2.7-liter flat-six engine producing 217 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful Boxster S variant is also available. The Boxster is generally praised for its balanced handling, responsive steering, and engaging driving dynamics. However, some common complaints include expensive maintenance, potential for certain mechanical failures, and a relatively small trunk. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic (Tiptronic).

**Engine**

**2.7L Flat-Six**

*   **IMS Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A potentially catastrophic engine failure caused by the intermediate shaft (IMS) bearing failing. Symptoms can include a metallic rattling noise, oil leaks, or sudden engine seizure. This is a more prevalent issue in earlier models with the single-row bearing.
    *   Solution: Replace the IMS bearing with an updated, more robust bearing. Options include ceramic hybrid bearings or retrofit kits that eliminate the IMS bearing altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Main Seal (RMS) Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the rear of the engine, where it connects to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear main seal. Often done in conjunction with an IMS bearing replacement since the engine and transmission need to be separated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500 (if done separately)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (General)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: General oil leaks coming from various places on the engine
    *   Solution: Replace gaskets

*   **Slipping or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, or failure to shift properly.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. However, more serious cases may require a rebuild or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Convertible Top Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the convertible top to operate properly, including sticking, slow operation, or complete failure.
