The 2011 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster known for its engaging driving dynamics and stylish design. The base model features a 2.9-liter flat-six engine producing 255 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. The Boxster S boasts a 3.4-liter flat-six engine with 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally praise the Boxster for its precise handling, responsive engines, and open-air driving experience. Common criticisms include the relatively small interior space, limited storage, and the higher cost of maintenance and repairs compared to more mainstream vehicles.
