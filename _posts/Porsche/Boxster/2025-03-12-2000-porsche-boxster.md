The 2000 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster known for its balanced handling and engaging driving experience. The standard engine option is a 2.7L flat-six producing 217 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.2L flat-six, producing 250 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, was available in the Boxster S trim. The car came with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Boxster's precise steering, responsive throttle, and overall fun-to-drive nature. Common complaints include maintenance costs, the fragility of some plastic interior components, and some known mechanical issues.
