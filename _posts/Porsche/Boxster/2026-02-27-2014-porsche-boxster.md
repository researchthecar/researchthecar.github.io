### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Porsche Boxster is a mechanically sound sports car with a reputation for good reliability, especially concerning its core powertrain and chassis components. The most significant potential issue across both engine variants is the Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing, a known concern for older Porsche models, though less prevalent in later iterations. Transmission reliability is generally high, with the manual being exceptionally robust. The PDK, while advanced, can occasionally suffer from mechatronics or clutch issues. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon but are typically manageable. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of wear, particularly regarding the IMS bearing and potential oil leaks, are key to ensuring long-term dependability for this engaging roadster.
