The 2012 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster that offers a thrilling driving experience. The base model comes with a 2.9-liter flat-six engine producing 255 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful option is the Boxster S, which boasts a 3.4-liter flat-six engine delivering 315 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) dual-clutch transmission. Praised for its balanced handling, precise steering, and responsive engines, the Boxster provides an engaging open-top driving experience. Some criticisms include the relatively small interior space and the higher running costs associated with Porsche ownership.
