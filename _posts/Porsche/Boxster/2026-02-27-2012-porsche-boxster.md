### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Porsche Boxster is a well-built sports car with a generally strong reliability record. The most significant potential issues revolve around the Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing, which can lead to catastrophic engine failure if it fails, and potential leaks from the oil cooler. For PDK transmissions, mechatronics unit failures and clutch wear are noted concerns. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the convertible top mechanism and window regulators, can also arise. While these issues exist, they are not universally present, and many Boxsters are owned without major problems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any unusual noises or warning lights are crucial for ensuring long-term reliability.
