The 2005 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster lauded for its balanced handling and engaging driving experience. The standard engine for the 2005 Boxster is a 2.7-liter flat-six producing 240 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.2-liter flat-six, producing 280 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, is available in the Boxster S. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual (2.7L), a 6-speed manual (3.2L), or a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Boxster's nimble handling, responsive steering, and open-top experience. Common complaints often revolve around the cost of maintenance and potential for certain mechanical issues associated with older Porsche models.

**Summary**

The 2005 Porsche Boxster, while a rewarding sports car to own, is susceptible to age-related issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine, particularly the IMS bearing, which can lead to catastrophic engine failure if not addressed proactively. RMS leaks and AOS failures are also common. Suspension components like control arm bushings wear out over time, impacting handling. Electrically, the convertible top motor and ignition switch can fail. The Tiptronic transmission can suffer from valve body issues. Overall, potential owners should budget for maintenance and repairs, as these issues can be costly to address. While some issues are relatively minor, the potential for major engine repairs means a thorough pre-purchase inspection is crucial.
