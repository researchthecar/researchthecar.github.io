### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Porsche Boxster, while a rewarding driver's car, exhibits some common issues typical of its age and design. The most significant concern revolves around the engine, particularly the potential for Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing failure and rear main seal leaks, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can include clutch wear on manuals and torque converter or valve body problems on automatics. Suspension components like strut mounts and bushings are also known wear items. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and window regulators, can surface. The convertible top's hydraulic system is another area to monitor. Despite these potential pitfalls, many Boxsters have been well-maintained and can offer reliable performance if these known issues are addressed proactively or have already been repaired.
