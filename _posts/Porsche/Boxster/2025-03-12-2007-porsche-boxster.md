The 2007 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster known for its balanced handling and engaging driving experience. Available engines included a 2.7L flat-six producing 245 horsepower and 201 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4L flat-six in the Boxster S producing 295 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were offered with either a 5-speed manual (2.7L only), a 6-speed manual, or a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Boxster's precise steering, responsive throttle, and overall sporty feel. However, some common complaints include higher maintenance costs compared to other vehicles, potential engine issues, and a somewhat small interior.
