### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Porsche Boxster is a mechanically sound vehicle with a generally positive reliability record. The most significant potential concern revolves around the Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing, a known issue for this generation of Porsche flat-six engines, which can lead to catastrophic engine failure if it gives way. Rear main seal leaks are also a possibility. Beyond these engine-specific concerns, the transmissions (manual and automatic) and suspension systems are typically robust. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulator failures and headlight switch issues, are not uncommon but are generally less severe and costly to repair. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of the IMS bearing, the 2007 Boxster can be a rewarding and reliable sports car.
