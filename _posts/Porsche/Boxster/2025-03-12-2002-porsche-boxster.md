The 2002 Porsche Boxster is a mid-engine roadster that offers a fun and engaging driving experience. The base model is equipped with a 2.7-liter flat-6 engine producing 217 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, while the Boxster S boasts a 3.2-liter flat-6 generating 250 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. Drivers often praise the Boxster for its balanced handling, responsive steering, and overall sporty feel. Downsides often include the limited storage space, some maintenance complexities, and the potential for costly repairs, particularly concerning the IMS bearing.
