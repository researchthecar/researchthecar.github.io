**Summary**

The 2021 Porsche Macan, while lauded for its performance and luxury, can present owners with a range of issues. Engine problems like HPFP failures in the 2.0L and coolant leaks in the V6, transmission quirks, and potential air suspension issues can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins with battery drain and PCM malfunctions can also be frustrating. Interior rattles and sunroof problems, though less critical, can detract from the ownership experience. While some issues can be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes, others may require more substantial investments, making pre-purchase inspections and extended warranties worthwhile considerations.
