**Summary**

The 2016 Porsche Macan offers a thrilling driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly timing chain issues on the 2.0L engine, oil leaks on the 3.6L engine, and coolant leaks on the 3.0L, can be costly to repair. PDK transmission problems, like Mechatronic unit failures or clutch slippage, are also a significant concern. Electrical issues, air suspension problems (if equipped), sunroof problems, and interior component failures can add to the ownership expenses. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars. Pre-purchase inspections and a thorough maintenance history are highly recommended.
