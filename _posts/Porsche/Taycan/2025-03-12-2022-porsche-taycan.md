Available in several trims, including the base Taycan, 4S, GTS, Turbo, and Turbo S, the car offers various power outputs and battery sizes. The base Taycan features a single-motor, rear-wheel-drive configuration, while higher trims utilize dual-motor, all-wheel-drive systems. Horsepower ranges from around 402 hp to over 750 hp in the Turbo S with overboost. Torque figures vary similarly based on trim and battery pack. What people often love about the Taycan is its blend of performance and electric technology, its sporty driving dynamics, and its luxurious interior. Some common dislikes include the high price tag, range limitations compared to some other EVs, and the complexity of the infotainment system.

**Electric Motor**

**Performance Battery Plus (All Trims)**

*   **Battery Degradation Concerns**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing slightly faster-than-expected battery degradation over the first year or two of ownership, leading to a reduction in overall range.
    *   Solution: Porsche recommends regular battery health checks and proper charging habits (avoiding frequent charging to 100% and prolonged storage at high or low states of charge). If degradation is excessive, warranty coverage may apply, but this is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: If within warranty, covered. Out of warranty, replacing the battery pack is extremely expensive, potentially costing $20,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 12V auxiliary battery draining, leading to starting problems or electrical malfunctions. This can manifest as a "Key Not Detected" error or other electrical gremlins.
    *   Solution: Dealers typically diagnose the cause of the drain, which can range from a faulty module to an issue with the charging system. Solutions can include software updates, replacing the 12V battery, or replacing a malfunctioning module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+, depending on the cause and the necessary repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunctions (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with air suspension can experience issues such as uneven ride height, suspension warning lights, or a complete failure of the air suspension system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for leaks in the air lines, faulty air struts, and issues with the air compressor or control module. Repairs can range from replacing a leaking air strut to replacing the compressor or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+, depending on the component that needs replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system can experience various glitches, including freezing, lagging, random reboots, and connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the primary solution, but in some cases, a hardware replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free. Hardware replacement can cost $1,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the charging system can include failure to charge, slow charging speeds, or error messages related to the charging port or charging equipment.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the charging port, the onboard charger, the charging cable, and the electrical system. Solutions can include replacing the charging port, updating the software, or replacing the onboard charger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+, depending on the component that needs replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Park Assist, Lane Keep Assist, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with parking sensors, lane keep assist, or other driver-assistance features can occur, resulting in false alerts, system failures, or inaccurate readings.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the sensors for damage or obstructions, calibrating the sensors, or replacing faulty sensors or control modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the sensor and the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Creaking/Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing creaking or rattling noises from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior components, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: This usually involves locating the source of the noise and applying felt tape, foam padding, or other sound-dampening materials to eliminate the friction between the components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the severity and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Porsche Taycan is a highly desirable electric vehicle that delivers impressive performance and luxury. While generally reliable, some owners have reported issues with battery degradation, the infotainment system, and electrical components. The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor glitches and others requiring more significant repairs. The cost of repairs can also range widely, from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for more extensive repairs, especially those related to the battery or air suspension. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect the vehicle's history and condition before making a purchase.
