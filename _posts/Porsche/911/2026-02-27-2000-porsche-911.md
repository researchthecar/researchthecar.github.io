# 2000 Porsche 911

### Overview
The 2000 Porsche 911 (996 generation) represents a significant shift for the iconic sports car, introducing water-cooling and a more modern design. While generally considered a capable and engaging vehicle, this generation is known to have specific areas that require attention from an ownership perspective. Early models, in particular, faced some well-documented challenges, primarily concerning the 'M96' engine's internal components and potential for IMS bearing failure. Transmission reliability is generally good, but as with any performance vehicle, maintenance is key. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components exhibit a mixed reliability profile, with some common issues emerging over time.
