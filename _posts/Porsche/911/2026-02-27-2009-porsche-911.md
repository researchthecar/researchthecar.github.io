### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Porsche 911 is a highly reliable sports car, with most owners reporting satisfaction. The primary concern for models equipped with the Mezger engine (GT3 variants) is the absence of the Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing, which is a known failure point on other 911 engines of this era. For Carrera models, the IMS bearing is a significant potential issue that requires attention, either through preventative maintenance or repair if symptoms arise. Oil leaks are also a possibility but generally manageable. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulator failures, can occur but are not widespread. Overall, the 2009 911 offers a compelling blend of performance and dependability, provided potential IMS issues are understood and addressed.
