The 2012 Porsche 911, part of the 991 generation, is celebrated for its blend of performance and everyday usability. Engine options include a 3.4L flat-six producing 350 horsepower and 287 lb-ft of torque (Carrera), a 3.8L flat-six producing 400 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque (Carrera S), and a turbocharged 3.8L flat-six producing 500 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque (911 Turbo). Transmission choices consist of a 7-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch PDK automatic. Owners generally praise the 911 for its precise handling, powerful engines, and iconic design. Criticisms often involve the relatively high cost of ownership and potential for expensive repairs, especially as the cars age.
