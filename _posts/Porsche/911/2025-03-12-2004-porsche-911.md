Engine options include a 3.6L flat-six producing 320 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque (Carrera and Targa) and a 3.6L flat-six producing 415 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque (Turbo). Available transmissions are a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic. Owners generally appreciate the 911's handling, acceleration, and iconic styling, but some dislike the potential for high maintenance costs and specific component failures.
