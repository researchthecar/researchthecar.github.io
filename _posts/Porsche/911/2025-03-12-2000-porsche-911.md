The 2000 Porsche 911 (996 generation) is a sports car known for its performance and handling. Available as a coupe, convertible (Cabriolet), or Targa, it offered a range of engine and transmission options. The base model featured a 3.4L flat-six engine producing around 300 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Higher performance models, like the Carrera 4S and Turbo, offered even more power. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic. Common praises include the responsive handling, powerful engine, and iconic design, while criticisms often involve the "fried egg" headlights, interior materials, and potential for costly repairs.
