The 2018 Porsche 911 is a sports car lauded for its exceptional performance, handling, and iconic design. The base Carrera models feature a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged flat-six engine producing 370 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include higher-output versions of the same 3.0-liter engine, a 3.8-liter flat-six in the GT3, and a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged flat-six in the Turbo models. Transmission choices include a 7-speed manual and a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Owners typically praise the 911's driving dynamics, build quality, and timeless appeal. Common criticisms involve the high price tag, limited rear seat space (in models equipped with rear seats), and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Summary**

The 2018 Porsche 911, while a desirable sports car, can experience a range of issues. Engine issues such as timing chain cover oil leaks and fuel injector failure, particularly on the 3.0L engines, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the PDK, suspension problems with the PASM shocks, and electrical problems with the PCM can also lead to significant repair bills. It is important to note that, while these are common issues, not every 2018 Porsche 911 will experience them. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Porsche technician is highly recommended. The severity and cost of these issues can vary significantly based on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
