The 2002 Porsche 911 (996 generation) is a sports car appreciated for its engaging driving dynamics, iconic styling, and relatively accessible price point compared to later models. It's available as a coupe, convertible, and Targa. Engine options include a 3.6L flat-six (Carrera, Targa, Cabriolet) producing 320 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 3.6L flat-six (Turbo) producing 415 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque.
