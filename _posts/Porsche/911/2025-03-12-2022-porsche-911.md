**Summary**

The 2022 Porsche 911, while an exceptional sports car, has been reported to have some common issues. Engine oil and coolant leaks are prevalent, particularly in the 3.0L turbocharged flat-six, and can become expensive if left unchecked. The PDK transmission can also experience issues with harsh shifting, and electrical problems with the PCM are also fairly common. Suspension malfunctions with the PASM system can also be a costly repair. While these issues may not affect every vehicle, potential buyers should be aware of these concerns and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to more significant repairs, with costs varying from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the specific problem and its complexity.
