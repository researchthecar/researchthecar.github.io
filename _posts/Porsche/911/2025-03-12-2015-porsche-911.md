The 2015 Porsche 911 is a performance icon, praised for its sharp handling, powerful engines, and luxurious interior. However, like all vehicles, it has its share of potential problems. The 2015 911 offered a range of engines including a 3.4L flat-six producing 350 horsepower and 287 lb-ft of torque (Carrera), a 3.8L flat-six producing 400 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque (Carrera S), and a turbocharged 3.8L flat-six producing 520 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque (Turbo). Transmission options included a 7-speed manual and a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Common criticisms include the high cost of maintenance and repairs, and some find the rear seats to be virtually unusable. Many people love its classic styling, exhilarating driving experience, and the prestige of owning a Porsche.

**Summary**

The 2015 Porsche 911, while a desirable sports car, can present owners with various issues. Engine oil leaks and potential cylinder scoring are significant concerns, particularly for the 3.8L engine. The PDK transmission can suffer from Mechatronic unit failures, leading to expensive repairs. Electrical problems, such as battery drain and PCM issues, are also relatively common. Suspension and interior issues are also a possibility. While some issues may be minor and relatively inexpensive to address, others, such as engine rebuilds or PDK transmission repairs, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect any used 2015 911 before purchase.
