The 2019 Porsche 911 (992 generation) represents the eighth generation of the iconic sports car. It blends classic 911 styling with modern technology and performance. Engine options for the 2019 911 Carrera and Carrera S models included a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged flat-six engine, producing 379 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque in the Carrera, and 443 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque in the Carrera S. Both engines were available with either an 8-speed dual-clutch PDK transmission or a 7-speed manual (though the manual arrived slightly later in the model year). Owners praise the 992 for its improved performance, refined interior, and updated technology. Common dislikes include the increased complexity and some concerns about long-term reliability due to the turbocharged engines and extensive electronics.
