The 2003 Porsche 911, often referred to as the 996 generation, is a sports car celebrated for its performance and iconic design. It came with several engine options, including the base 3.6L flat-six producing 320 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, and the turbocharged 3.6L flat-six found in the 911 Turbo, generating 415 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic. Many appreciate the 996 for its engaging driving dynamics and accessible price point compared to later 911 models. Common complaints often revolve around the Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing issue and the potential for rear main seal (RMS) leaks.

**Summary**

The 2003 Porsche 911 (996) is a desirable sports car, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The IMS bearing failure is a significant concern, as it can lead to catastrophic engine damage, making a pre-purchase inspection essential. RMS leaks are also common and can be costly to address. Other issues, such as turbocharger problems on the Turbo models and suspension wear, should also be inspected. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, so budgeting for potential maintenance is crucial.
