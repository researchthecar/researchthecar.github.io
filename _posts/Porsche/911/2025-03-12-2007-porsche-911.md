The 2007 Porsche 911 (997.1 generation) is a highly desirable sports car known for its iconic design, engaging driving dynamics, and powerful engines. Engine options include the 3.6L flat-six producing 325 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.8L flat-six producing 355 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque (Carrera S). Transmission options consist of a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic. Owners often praise the 911's precise handling, strong acceleration, and timeless styling. Common complaints revolve around maintenance costs, the IMS bearing issue in some models (addressed below), and the somewhat cramped interior for larger drivers.

**Engine**

**3.6L Flat-Six (Carrera)**

*   **IMS Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A failing IMS (Intermediate Shaft) bearing can cause engine damage due to metal contamination, eventually leading to catastrophic engine failure. Symptoms include unusual engine noises (e.g., rattling or ticking), metal shavings in the oil filter, and potential oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IMS bearing with an aftermarket upgraded bearing is recommended, often done in conjunction with a clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of engine damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Rear Main Seal - RMS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from the rear main seal, located between the engine and transmission. Symptoms include oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and visible oil residue around the transmission bell housing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the RMS. This often requires removing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replacement of the RMS. This often requires removing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil can leak from the valve cover gaskets as they age and become brittle. The leaks often occur on the exhaust side of the engine. Symptoms include oil drips onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Electrical**

*   **Convertible Top Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The convertible top mechanism can experience issues, including failure to open or close properly, slow operation, or unusual noises. This can be caused by faulty sensors, hydraulic pump issues, or damaged linkages.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the specific cause (sensor, pump, or linkage) and repair or replacement of the affected component(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels on the LCD screen in the instrument cluster may fail, leading to incomplete or unreadable information.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings can occur, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the headlight components.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlights and resealing them, or replacing the headlight assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Professional cleaning to remove the coating, or replacement of the affected parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Porsche 911 is a desirable sports car, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues. The IMS bearing issue, though not universally prevalent, is a serious concern on some models and can lead to significant engine damage. Oil leaks, particularly from the rear main seal, are also common. Electrical and interior issues can also arise. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs like engine or transmission work can be costly. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Porsche mechanic are highly recommended.
