The 2001 Porsche 911 (996 generation) is a sports car known for its performance and iconic design, though this generation is sometimes criticized for its "fried egg" headlights. The base model featured a 3.4-liter flat-six engine producing 300 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included the 3.6-liter flat-six in the Carrera and the turbocharged engines in the 911 Turbo models. Transmission options were a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic. Owners appreciate the 996's handling and driving experience, but common complaints revolve around engine issues, particularly related to the Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing.
