### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Porsche 911 (991) generally exhibits strong reliability, consistent with the brand's performance heritage. The most notable potential issues revolve around the Intermediate Shaft (IMS) bearing, a known concern for earlier 911 generations that can still affect this model, and potential leaks from the rear main seal. The PDK transmission, while advanced, can experience issues with its mechatronics unit or clutch packs. The manual transmission is typically very robust. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, can occur. The chassis, suspension (excluding potential PASM damper issues), exterior, and interior components are generally well-built and reliable. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any unusual noises or warning lights are crucial for maintaining the long-term reliability of this high-performance sports car.
