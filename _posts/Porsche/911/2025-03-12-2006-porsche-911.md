The 2006 Porsche 911 (997 generation) is a desirable sports car known for its performance and iconic design. Available as a Carrera, Carrera S, Targa, or Turbo, the 2006 models offered several engine and transmission options. The base Carrera featured a 3.6L flat-6 engine producing 325 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. The Carrera S received a larger 3.8L flat-6, boosting output to 355 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed Tiptronic automatic. Owners often praise the 911's handling, steering feel, and driving experience, but potential drawbacks include higher maintenance costs and specific known issues with certain components.
