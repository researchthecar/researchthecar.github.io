The 2022 Porsche 718 Cayman is a mid-engine sports car available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-four and a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-six. The 2.0-liter engine produces 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.5-liter engine produces 350 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed manual transmission or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.
