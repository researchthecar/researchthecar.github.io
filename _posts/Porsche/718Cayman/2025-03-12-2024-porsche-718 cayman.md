The 2024 Porsche 718 Cayman is a popular sports car known for its exceptional handling and engaging driving experience. It's available with several engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 2.0L turbocharged flat-4 producing 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Higher trims offer a 2.5L turbocharged flat-4 with 350 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque or a naturally aspirated 4.0L flat-6, delivering 394 hp in the GTS 4.0, and 493 hp in the GT4 RS. Transmission choices typically include a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the Cayman's precise steering, balanced chassis, and distinctive Porsche styling. Common complaints revolve around limited cargo space, a relatively firm ride, and the high cost of options.
