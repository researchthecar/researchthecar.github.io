The 2018 Porsche 718 Cayman is a mid-engine sports car praised for its precise handling, engaging driving dynamics, and stylish design. Available engine options for the 2018 Cayman include a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-four producing 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-four producing 350 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque in the Cayman S. Both engines are offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners typically appreciate the Cayman's responsive steering, balanced chassis, and overall performance. Some criticisms include the flat-four engine sound (compared to the older flat-six engines) and the relatively high price point.
