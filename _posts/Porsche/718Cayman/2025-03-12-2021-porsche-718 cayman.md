The 2021 Porsche 718 Cayman is a mid-engine sports car known for its exceptional handling and engaging driving experience. It's offered with several engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-4 producing 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. A 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-4 that generates 350 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque is available for the S model. The GTS 4.0 and GT4 models feature a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-6, which produces 394 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque for the GTS 4.0 and 414 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque for the GT4. Transmission choices include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Owners typically praise the Cayman for its precise steering, balanced chassis, and overall fun-to-drive nature. Common complaints revolve around the base engine's sound, the limited practicality of a two-seater sports car, and the relatively high cost of options.

**Summary**

The 2021 Porsche 718 Cayman is generally a reliable sports car. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The most frequently reported problems relate to oil and coolant leaks, particularly in the 2.0L and 2.5L turbocharged engines, as well as electrical gremlins like PCM failures and battery drain. Harsh shifting in the PDK transmission has also been noted. Most repairs range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, although a PCM replacement or engine repair can quickly escalate costs. While significant recalls are not common, addressing potential issues early can prevent more serious and expensive repairs down the line.
