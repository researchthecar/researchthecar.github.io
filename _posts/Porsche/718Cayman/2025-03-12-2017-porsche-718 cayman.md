The 2017 Porsche 718 Cayman is a mid-engine sports car known for its sharp handling and driver-focused experience. The base model came equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-4 engine producing 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. The Cayman S offered a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-4 engine that delivers 350 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic. Owners typically praise the Cayman's precise steering, balanced chassis, and responsive engines. Common complaints include the flat-4 engine sound (compared to the previous flat-6), and some find the infotainment system dated.
