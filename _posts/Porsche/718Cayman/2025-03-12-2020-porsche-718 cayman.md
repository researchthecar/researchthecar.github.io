The 2020 Porsche 718 Cayman is a popular sports car known for its exceptional handling, stylish design, and engaging driving experience. It comes with several engine and transmission options. The base model features a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-four engine producing 300 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-four engine producing 350 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque is available in the Cayman S. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on both engines, while a seven-speed PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) dual-clutch transmission is optional. Many owners praise the 718 Cayman for its precise steering, balanced chassis, and responsive engines. Some common complaints include the flat-four engine's sound, which some find less appealing than the traditional flat-six, and the limited storage space.
