The 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and traditional body-on-frame construction. It came standard with a 4.6L Modular V8 engine, producing around 220 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. No other engine options were available. A 4-speed automatic transmission was the only transmission option. Owners often praise the Grand Marquis for its reliability, ease of maintenance, and smooth highway cruising. Common complaints include its relatively poor fuel economy and somewhat dated styling.

**Summary**

The 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues like intake manifold cracks, spark plug thread issues, transmission problems, air suspension failures (if equipped), and electrical gremlins. While some repairs, like replacing a blend door actuator or repairing minor rust, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as a transmission rebuild or air suspension overhaul, can be costly. Overall, pre-purchase inspection focusing on these common issues will assist in mitigating potential costly repair bills.
