The 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and traditional styling. It was only available with a 4.6L Modular V8 engine, producing approximately 220 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Grand Marquis for its reliability, smooth ride, and simple, easy-to-repair design. Common dislikes include its relatively poor fuel economy, dated styling, and somewhat uninspired handling compared to more modern vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it's prone to certain issues. The most common problems revolve around the engine's intake manifold and spark plug threads, the transmission's shifting characteristics, and the air suspension (if equipped). Electrical issues like blend door actuator failure and window regulator problems are also fairly common. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in colder climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or suspension overhauls, can be quite costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering a 2002 Grand Marquis.
