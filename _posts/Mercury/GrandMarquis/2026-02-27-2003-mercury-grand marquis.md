### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis is generally a reliable vehicle, particularly its powertrain. The 4.6L V8 engine and 4R70W transmission are known for their durability when properly maintained. However, common issues for vehicles of this age and platform include potential intake manifold cracks and spark plug blow-outs on the engine, and solenoid or band issues in the transmission. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints can wear, and if equipped with air suspension, the compressor is a potential failure point. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling are cosmetic but common. Interior climate control blend doors and power seat modules can also require attention. Overall, while not immune to age-related problems, many Grand Marquis models offer a solid ownership experience with proactive maintenance addressing these known issues.
