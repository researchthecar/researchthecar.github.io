### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercury Grand Marquis is a generally reliable vehicle, especially concerning its core powertrain. The 4.6L V8 engine is known for its durability, though intake manifold gasket leaks and cam sync issues are documented. The 4-speed automatic transmission is also robust but can develop torque converter or fluid leak problems with age. Suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links are common wear items. Electrical issues, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior paint and interior HVAC components are also areas where owners might encounter issues. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing these specific potential problems, the Grand Marquis can offer many years of dependable service.
