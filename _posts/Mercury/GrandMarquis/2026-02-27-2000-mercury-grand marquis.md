### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mercury Grand Marquis is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly its robust 4.6L V8 engine. Common issues tend to be concentrated in areas like the transmission (specifically the 4R70W), where solenoid failures and band wear can occur. Suspension components, such as ball joints, may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are also reported. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling are common for vehicles of this age. While not immune to problems, most issues are repairable and well-documented, making the Grand Marquis a potentially good value if properly maintained and any existing issues are addressed.
