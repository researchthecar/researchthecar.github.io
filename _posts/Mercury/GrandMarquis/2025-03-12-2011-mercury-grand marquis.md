The 2011 Mercury Grand Marquis is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and traditional body-on-frame construction. It came standard with a 4.6L Modular V8 engine producing 224 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Grand Marquis for its reliability, smooth ride, and ease of maintenance, but dislike its dated styling, poor fuel economy, and less-than-agile handling compared to more modern vehicles.
