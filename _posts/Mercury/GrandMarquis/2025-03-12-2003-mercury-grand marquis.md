The 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. All 2003 Grand Marquis models came equipped with the 4.6L Modular V8 engine, producing 220 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque (single exhaust) or 235 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque (dual exhaust). This engine was paired with a 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the car's smooth highway cruising, large trunk, and traditional American sedan feel. Common complaints include its outdated styling, relatively poor fuel economy compared to newer vehicles, and handling that prioritizes comfort over sportiness.

**Engine**

**4.6L Modular V8 (Single & Dual Exhaust)**

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, overheating, loss of power, and coolant smell. Cracks often develop in the composite intake manifold, specifically around the coolant crossover passage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold with an updated version (often utilizing an aluminum coolant crossover) is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to weak aluminum threads. This results in a loud popping noise, misfire, and potential damage to the spark plug and surrounding components.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the cylinder head. Thread repair kits are available but may not be a permanent solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on repair method and extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling, or erratic idle speed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shifting Problems/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or failure to shift. Can be caused by worn valve body components or internal wear in the transmission.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution could range from a fluid flush and filter change to valve body repair/replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during light acceleration, or unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the car sagging, compressor running constantly, or error messages on the dashboard. Common failure points include the air springs (bags) themselves, the air compressor, and the height sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air spring(s), compressor, or height sensor(s). Conversion to coil springs is also a common alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the component and whether converting to coil springs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps. Steering wander or looseness.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the temperature of the air coming from the vents. The actuator controls the blend door, which mixes hot and cold air.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to go up or down, or making grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the lower body panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage, especially in areas with heavy road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on severity, $100 - $1000+ per area.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine problems such as intake manifold failure and spark plug thread issues can be costly to repair. Transmission problems can be a major concern and expensive to fix. Suspension issues, especially with the air suspension, can also lead to significant repair bills. Electrical issues, like the blend door actuator, are relatively minor but still inconvenient. Rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, while many of these issues are relatively common for a vehicle of this age, being aware of them can help potential buyers make an informed decision and budget accordingly.
