**Summary**

The 2008 Mercury Grand Marquis, while generally reliable, has some common issues owners should be aware of. The spark plug and intake manifold issues on the 4.6L engine and torque converter issues on the transmission can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension problems with the air suspension system (if equipped) can also be costly. Electrical issues, while less severe, can still be annoying. Rust is a concern in areas with harsh winters. While some of the repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can run into the hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Buyers should carefully inspect potential vehicles for these issues before purchasing.
