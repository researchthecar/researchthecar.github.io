The 2006 Mercury Mountaineer is a mid-size SUV that offers a comfortable ride and ample cargo space. Engine options included a 4.0L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.6L V8 generating 292 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mountaineer's spacious interior and smooth ride, but common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly concerning the electrical system and drivetrain components.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**
*   **Timing Chain Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially on startup, coming from the front of the engine. This indicates wear or stretching of the timing chain, potentially leading to incorrect valve timing and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Thermostat Housing Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking from the thermostat housing, often accompanied by a low coolant level warning.
    * Solution: Replacement of the thermostat housing and gasket. Aftermarket housings are generally more reliable.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Ejection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs being ejected from the cylinder head due to stripped threads. This is a common issue with certain Ford engines from this era, including the 4.6L V8.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with a thread insert kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (thread repair), $1500 - $3000+ (cylinder head replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gaskets, often resulting in a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**
*   **Erratic Shifting/Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or a complete loss of gear engagement.
    *   Solution: This could stem from a malfunctioning transmission control module (TCM), worn valve body, or internal damage. Depending on the severity, solutions range from TCM reprogramming or valve body replacement to a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (TCM reprogram), $500 - $1200 (valve body), $2500 - $4500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging or not maintaining the correct ride height. This indicates a leak in the air springs, a failing air compressor, or a malfunctioning ride height sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs, air compressor, or ride height sensor. Conversion to coil springs is also an option, though it alters the ride characteristics.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (air springs), $250 - $600 (compressor), $100 - $300 (sensor), $500 - $1000 (coil spring conversion)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Front Ball Joint Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noise from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    * Solution: Replacement of the ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the temperature of the air coming from the vents, with either only hot or only cold air blowing. Clicking noise from the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by a variety of electrical issues.
    * Solution: Requires diagnostic to find the parasitic drain.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+ depending on issue
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Liftgate Window Hinge Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The hinges for the liftgate window rust and fail, causing the window to detach.
    * Solution: Replacing the hinges or the entire liftgate window assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sun visors no longer stay in the up position and constantly sag down, obstructing the driver's view.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per visor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Mercury Mountaineer can be a comfortable and practical SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine problems like spark plug ejection and timing chain rattle, transmission issues, and electrical glitches are some of the things to look out for. Suspension issues, particularly with the rear air suspension, and interior problems like sun visor sagging, also pop up often. The severity and cost of these repairs vary widely. Some issues like blend door actuators are relatively inexpensive to fix, while others such as a full transmission rebuild or cylinder head replacement can be very costly.
