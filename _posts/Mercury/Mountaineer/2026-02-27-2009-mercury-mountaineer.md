### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercury Mountaineer presents a mixed reliability profile. The 4.0L V6 engine is more prone to specific issues like cooling system leaks and spark plug blowout compared to the generally more robust 4.6L V8. Transmission issues, particularly with the 5R55W, often involve solenoids and torque converters. Suspension components like ball joints and control arms can wear out, and if equipped with rear air suspension, failures are possible. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are also noted. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
