The 2001 Mercury Mountaineer is a mid-size SUV that shares many components with the Ford Explorer. The Mountaineer aimed for a slightly more upscale experience. Engine options included a 4.0L SOHC V6 engine producing 210 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L OHV V8 engine producing 215 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Mountaineer's comfortable ride and spacious interior, but common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly with the automatic transmission, and rust problems.

**Engine**

**4.0L SOHC V6**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable rattling sound from the front of the engine, particularly on startup or when the engine is cold. This is caused by worn timing chain tensioners and/or guides.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the plastic intake manifold, often near the thermostat housing. This can lead to overheating and coolant loss.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**5.0L OHV V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or hissing sound, especially when the engine is cold, that dissipates as the engine warms up. This is caused by cracked exhaust manifolds, often near the cylinder head flange.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (5R55E)**

*   **Slipping and Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, or failure to shift at all. This is often caused by worn valve body components or internal clutch wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at lower speeds or during acceleration. This can also cause stalling or a complete loss of transmission function.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+

**Suspension**

*   **Front Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noise from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Excessive play in the front wheels can also be observed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the upper and/or lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, or the vehicle leans to one side.  A broken leaf spring can cause a loud snapping noise and significantly affect handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Electrical**

*   **Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows fail to go up or down or move very slowly.
    *   Solution: Window motor replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges not working, lights not working, flickering, or full failure of the instrument cluster
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the rocker panels and around the wheel arches. This is especially common in areas with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, patching, or replacement of affected panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on severity

**Interior**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent air temperature from the vents, or the inability to change the temperature.  Clicking noises behind the dashboard can also be heard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

**Recalls**

*   **Speed Control System**
    *   Description: On certain sport utility vehicles, the speed control cable could become disconnected from the speed control servo due to corrosion of the speed control cable end fitting. This could prevent the driver from deactivating the speed control system, either by depressing the brake pedal or by using the 'off' switch. If the driver could not deactivate the speed control, it could lead to a crash.
    *   Recall Number: 05V471000

*   **Fuel Tank**
    *   Description: Certain sport utility vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 301, "Fuel System Integrity." The fuel tank assembly does not provide adequate resistance to puncture during a vehicle crash. This could result in a fuel leak and possible fire.
    *   Recall Number: 01V353000

In summary, the 2001 Mercury Mountaineer has several common issues. The transmission is a significant concern with potential for costly repairs, while engine issues like timing chain rattle and exhaust manifold leaks also contribute to maintenance expenses. Rust can be a major problem, particularly in areas with road salt. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, potentially making the overall ownership experience challenging.
