The 2004 Mercury Mountaineer is a mid-size SUV that offered a comfortable ride and decent cargo space. It came with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing approximately 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.6L V8 generating around 239 horsepower and 282 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Mountaineer's smooth ride and spacious interior, but common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly regarding the suspension, electrical systems, and some engine components.

**Summary**

The 2004 Mercury Mountaineer can be a comfortable and practical SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that can arise. The air suspension, if equipped, is a known trouble spot and can be costly to maintain. Engine issues with the 4.0L V6 such as the timing chain are prevalent. Electrical problems with the blend door actuators and window motors are relatively common and less expensive to fix. Overall, carefully inspecting the vehicle, especially the suspension and electrical systems, and addressing any potential issues promptly, is crucial for a reliable ownership experience.
