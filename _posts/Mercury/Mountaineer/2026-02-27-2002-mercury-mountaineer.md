### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercury Mountaineer can be a reliable SUV if well-maintained, but it is not without its potential issues. The 4.0L V6 engine is the primary concern, with timing chain tensioner and intake manifold gasket problems being relatively common. Transmission issues, particularly with the 5-speed automatic, can also arise, often related to solenoids or the torque converter. Suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links are also areas to inspect. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. While the V8 engine and exterior/interior generally fare better, prospective buyers should budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the engine and transmission.
