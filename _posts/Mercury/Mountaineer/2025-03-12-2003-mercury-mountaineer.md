The 2003 Mercury Mountaineer is a mid-size SUV that offered a blend of comfort and capability. It came with either a 4.0L V6 engine producing 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque or a 4.6L V8 engine rated at 239 horsepower and 282 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mountaineer's spacious interior and smooth ride, but some common complaints include issues with reliability and certain components wearing out prematurely.
