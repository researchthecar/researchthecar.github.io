### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercury Monterey is generally considered a reliable vehicle, particularly its powertrain. The 4.6L V8 engine is robust and typically does not present major issues. However, owners may encounter some common problems, primarily related to the automatic transmission, such as fluid leaks and torque converter issues. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rod ends can wear over time, leading to steering and noise problems.
