### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercury Monterey is a capable minivan with a few common areas of concern that owners should be aware of. The 4.2L V6 engine can experience intake manifold gasket leaks and spark plug blowout issues, while the automatic transmission may develop torque converter shudder or slipping. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also noted for wear. Electrically, the Body Control Module and alternator are potential failure points. Exterior rust can be an issue on older models, and interior climate control blend doors and power sliding door mechanisms are also reported to fail. Despite these potential issues, many Monterys remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
