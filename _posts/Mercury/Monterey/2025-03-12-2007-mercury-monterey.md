The 2007 Mercury Monterey is a minivan that offers comfortable seating and a smooth ride. It was available with a single engine option, the 4.2L Essex V6 producing 201 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Monterey's spacious interior and quiet cabin, but some dislike its relatively poor fuel economy and bland styling. Common criticisms also revolve around the vehicle's reliability and the cost of repairs.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercury Monterey, while offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior, is prone to several common issues. Engine problems such as intake manifold gasket leaks and spark plug issues, transmission problems like rough shifting, and electrical issues such as power door lock and sliding door malfunctions are frequently reported. Suspension issues, especially with the rear air suspension (if equipped), can also be costly. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as transmission rebuilds or air suspension repairs, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have any used Monterey thoroughly inspected before purchase.
