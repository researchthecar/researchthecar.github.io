The 2009 Mercury Mariner is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. Available engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 (171 hp, 171 lb-ft torque), a 3.0L V6 (240 hp, 223 lb-ft torque), and a 2.5L inline-4 hybrid. Transmission options consist of a 6-speed automatic for the V6 and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for the hybrid model, with the 4-cylinder engine offered with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Mariner's spacious interior and user-friendly features, but some criticize its dated styling and occasional reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

* **Engine Misfires/Rough Running**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and a noticeable decrease in performance. May trigger the check engine light.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause and replacing the faulty part such as spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. In some cases, a software update may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-4 Hybrid**

* **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, decreased electric range, and the "check hybrid system" warning light. Eventually the vehicle may be unable to start or drive in electric-only mode.
    * Solution: Replacing the hybrid battery pack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $8000+ (depending on new vs. refurbished)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (V6 & 4-Cylinder)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting between gears, especially during acceleration. Can lead to transmission slipping and eventual failure.
    * Solution: Performing a transmission flush and filter change may alleviate minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for flush, $800 - $3000+ for rebuild/replacement

    * Solution: Replacement of the CVT unit. CVTs are not typically rebuilt.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $7000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing worn components such as struts, shocks, sway bar links, and ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the components needing replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

The 2009 Mercury Mariner presents a range of potential issues, from relatively minor electrical problems to more significant engine and transmission concerns, particularly with the hybrid model's battery and CVT. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely, with hybrid battery replacements being the most expensive potential issue. Addressing these common problems promptly can help maintain the Mariner's reliability and extend its lifespan.
