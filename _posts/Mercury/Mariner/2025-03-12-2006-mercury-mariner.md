The 2006 Mercury Mariner was a compact SUV offered with a few engine options, including a 2.3L inline-4 engine producing around 153 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine producing around 200 horsepower and 193 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Mariner for its comfortable ride and relatively stylish interior for its time. Common complaints included mediocre fuel economy, some reliability issues, and less cargo space than some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-4**

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, check engine light, decreased fuel economy, and hesitation during acceleration. Often caused by faulty ignition coils.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). Replacing spark plugs may also be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per ignition coil, depending on location and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

* **Engine Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level. Common leak points include valve cover gaskets and the oil pan gasket.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+, depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

* **Erratic Shifting/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or difficulty shifting.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush *may* temporarily alleviate the issue. However, if the issue persists or worsens, the cause is likely internal damage and requires professional diagnosis and repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+ for a fluid flush (which *may* not fix the issue). Internal repairs or transmission replacement can range from $1,500 - $3,500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Failure**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Steering may feel loose or wander. Can lead to uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. Replacing both ball joints on the same axle is recommended for even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side, including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**

    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more power windows failing to operate, often accompanied by a clicking sound from the door.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Ajar Light Stays On**

    *   Description/Symptoms: The "door ajar" warning light remains illuminated even when all doors are securely closed. This can drain the battery and prevent the dome light from turning off. Usually caused by a faulty door latch sensor.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Mercury Mariner has some common issues, primarily related to the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Engine oil leaks and ignition coil issues are common on the 2.3L and 3.0L engines, while transmission problems can be costly to address.
