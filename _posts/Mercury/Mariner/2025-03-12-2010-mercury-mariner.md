The 2010 Mercury Mariner is a compact SUV that offered a blend of comfort and practicality. Engine options included a 2.5L Inline-4 producing around 171 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 generating approximately 240 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L Inline-4 Hybrid. The 2.5L Inline-4 was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and the 3.0L V6 was mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Hybrid uses a CVT transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Mariner's comfortable ride and user-friendly features but sometimes disliked its fuel economy and less-than-inspiring handling.

**Summary**

The 2010 Mercury Mariner presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from minor electrical glitches to more significant engine or transmission problems. Engine oil leaks and harsh shifting with the automatic transmission are common concerns, while electrical issues like battery drain and power window failures can also occur. Suspension issues lead to reduced ride quality and handling. While most of these issues aren't catastrophic, they can add up in terms of repair costs. The severity and cost of repairs vary greatly depending on the specific issue, but owners should be prepared for potential expenses ranging from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars.
