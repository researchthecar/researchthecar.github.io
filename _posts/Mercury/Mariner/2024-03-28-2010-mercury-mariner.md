The 2010 Mercury Mariner is a midsize SUV that was discontinued in 2011. It was available with two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and a 3.0-liter V6 engine. Both engines were paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The Mariner received generally positive reviews for its comfortable interior, spacious cargo area, and strong performance.
