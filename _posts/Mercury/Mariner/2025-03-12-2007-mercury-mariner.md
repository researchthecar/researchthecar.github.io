The 2007 Mercury Mariner is a compact SUV that offered a blend of comfort and practicality. Engine options included a 2.3L inline-4 engine producing 153 hp and 152 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 engine outputting 200 hp and 193 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid 2.3L inline-4 engine.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercury Mariner, while offering a comfortable ride and decent features for its time, does have some common problems owners should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly with the timing chain on the 2.3L and IMRC on the 3.0L, can be costly. Transmission problems can also be significant. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are typical for a vehicle of this age. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should factor in these risks when considering a purchase.
