The 2011 Mercury Mariner was available with three powertrain options: a 2.5L inline-4 engine producing 171 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 engine producing 240 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L inline-4 hybrid powertrain. All engine options were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mariner's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency (especially the hybrid model). Common complaints include uninspired handling, dated interior styling, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating, a burning oil smell, and visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: The issue is often related to worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A temporary solution is to monitor the oil level and add oil as needed. The permanent solution is to replace the piston rings and/or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Can cause the check engine light to illuminate, rough idling, and difficulty starting the engine after refueling.
    * Solution: Replace the purge valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, rattling noise from under the vehicle, and illumination of the check engine light (typically with codes P0420 or P0430).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per converter (depending on location and shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-4 Hybrid**

*   **High Voltage Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, decreased electric-only range, frequent engine starts, and potential illumination of the hybrid system warning light.
    *   Solution: Individual module replacement within the high voltage battery can sometimes restore capacity. Complete battery replacement is the most reliable, but also the most expensive, solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the severity of degradation and choice of repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**All Engines (6F35 6-Speed Automatic Transmission)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting between gears, harsh or jerky shifts, and potential slipping of the transmission. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (recalibration), $800 - $1500 (valve body), $2500 - $5000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle appears lower than the front, especially when loaded. Can cause a bumpy ride and affect handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear coil springs or add aftermarket spring helpers/airbags.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose or vague steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints and/or control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side (depending on labor and components)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent operation of power windows, windows not working at all, or windows getting stuck.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noise behind the dashboard, inability to control the temperature of the air coming from the vents, or air only blowing hot or cold regardless of the setting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator. This can be a labor-intensive job due to the location of the actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the lower body panels, particularly around the rocker panels and wheel wells. This is especially common in areas with harsh winters and road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including removal of the rust, patching any holes, and repainting the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per area (depending on the severity and extent of the rust).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mercury Mariner has several potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The severity and cost of these issues vary, ranging from relatively inexpensive electrical component replacements to more costly engine or transmission repairs. Rust is a common issue in certain climates, and hybrid models may face battery degradation. Overall, a thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended before purchasing a used 2011 Mariner, particularly one with high mileage.
