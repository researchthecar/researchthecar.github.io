The 2005 Mercury Mariner was a compact SUV that offered a blend of comfort and practicality. Available engine options included a 2.3L inline-4 producing 153 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing 203 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Mariner's comfortable ride and relatively spacious interior, but some common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly with the automatic transmission and certain engine components.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine noise, particularly rattling upon startup, can indicate a stretched or worn timing chain. This can lead to poor engine performance and, in severe cases, engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, and a sweet coolant smell are common symptoms. This can also cause the engine to misfire.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Synchronizer Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A chirping or squealing noise coming from the engine, particularly at idle.
    * Solution: Replacing the camshaft synchronizer and possibly the camshaft position sensor.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, and failure to engage gears. These issues can be caused by worn valve body components or internal damage.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a valve body replacement or rebuild can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700 (valve body) / $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. This can also affect the vehicle's handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows failing to operate, or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Ajar Sensor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "door ajar" light staying on even when all doors are closed, potentially draining the battery.

**Summary**

The 2005 Mercury Mariner is generally considered a decent vehicle for its time but is prone to certain issues related to its age and typical wear and tear. Common complaints include engine issues like timing chain and intake manifold gasket failures, transmission problems, suspension wear, and electrical glitches. Rust can also be a significant concern. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchasing. Some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, while others, such as transmission rebuilds or extensive rust repair, can be quite costly.
