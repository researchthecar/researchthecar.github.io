The 2007 Mercury Montego was a full-size sedan that offered a comfortable ride and spacious interior. Engine options included a 3.0L Duratec V6 engine producing 203 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. The transmission option was an Aisin 6-speed automatic. Some owners liked the Montego's roomy cabin and smooth highway cruising, while others found its styling bland and its fuel economy underwhelming.

**Engine**

**3.0L Duratec V6**

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, and a whining noise from the engine.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump and coolant.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup or while idling, engine misfires, check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+

    * Solution: Replace leaking gaskets and seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per leak location
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin 6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shaking or shuddering during light acceleration, especially at lower speeds.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter is a common fix. Some have success with a transmission fluid flush and using a fluid additive designed to eliminate shudder.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ for torque converter replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay when shifting between gears, or rough/abrupt shifts. Can sometimes be intermittent.
    * Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, a faulty valve body, or worn internal components. A fluid flush and filter change might help. Valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild could be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid flush, $500 - $1,500+ for valve body, $2,500 - $4,500+ for rebuild
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Ball Joints and Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose or wandering steering. Uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace worn ball joints and/or control arm bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side, depending on which components need replacing.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or groaning noises from the suspension, especially when turning the steering wheel. Excessive suspension movement or instability.
    * Solution: Replace the strut mounts.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery repeatedly dies overnight or after short periods of inactivity.
    * Solution: Could be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module, accessory, or wiring issue. Requires diagnosis to identify the source of the draw and repair the affected component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, depending on the source of the draw. $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Ajar Light Stays On**
    * Description/Symptoms: The "door ajar" light on the dashboard remains illuminated even when all doors are closed properly. This can also prevent the interior lights from turning off and drain the battery.
    * Solution: Often caused by a faulty door latch sensor. Replacing the affected door latch assembly usually resolves the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercury Montego has some common issues, with the engine and transmission being primary areas of concern. Water pump failure, timing chain issues, and torque converter shudder can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical issues like battery drain and blend door actuator problems are also relatively frequent. While some issues are minor, others can be quite costly to address, potentially impacting the overall ownership experience.
