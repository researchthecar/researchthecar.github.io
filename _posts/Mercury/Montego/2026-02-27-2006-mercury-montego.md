### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercury Montego is a generally reliable vehicle, with its most common reported issues centering around the powertrain, particularly the CVT transmission and the 3.0L V6 engine's cooling system and intake manifold. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, can also be a concern. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings may require attention as the vehicle ages. While the exterior and interior are typically robust, potential buyers should be aware of these specific mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate repair costs and ensure longevity.
