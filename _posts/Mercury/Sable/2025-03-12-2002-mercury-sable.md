The 2002 Mercury Sable is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Engine options included a 3.0L Vulcan V6 producing 153 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L Duratec 24V V6 producing 200 hp and 200 lb-ft of torque.

**Summary**

The 2002 Mercury Sable can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as transmission problems, intake manifold leaks in the Vulcan V6, coil pack failures in the Duratec, and electrical gremlins. Suspension component wear is also common. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, from relatively inexpensive fixes like sway bar links to potentially costly repairs like transmission replacement. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Addressing these potential issues during a pre-purchase inspection can help avoid unexpected expenses down the road.
