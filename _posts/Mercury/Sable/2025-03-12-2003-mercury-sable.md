Engine issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks (Vulcan) or coil pack failures (Duratec), along with potential transmission problems, can lead to moderate repair costs. Electrical problems and rust are also areas to inspect. While the Sable doesn't have widespread, catastrophic problems, diligent maintenance and pre-purchase inspection are recommended. The average cost to repair the potential issues can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the severity and the shop performing the work.
