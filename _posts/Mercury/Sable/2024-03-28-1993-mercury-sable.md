**Introduction:**

The 1993 Mercury Sable is a mid-size sedan offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine is a 3.0-liter V6 that produces 140 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine is a 3.8-liter V6 that produces 155 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque.
