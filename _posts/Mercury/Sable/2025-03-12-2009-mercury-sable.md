The 2009 Mercury Sable is a full-size sedan that offered a comfortable ride and spacious interior. The sole engine option was a 3.5L Duratec V6 engine producing 263 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with an Aisin 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Sable's smooth ride and ample cabin space, but some disliked its somewhat bland styling and observed that it wasn't especially fuel efficient.

**Engine**

**3.5L Duratec V6**
* **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise, especially on startup, can indicate a stretched or worn timing chain. Can lead to poor engine performance and eventually engine failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Water Pump Failure (Internal)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The water pump is located internally, driven by the timing chain. Failure can cause coolant to leak into the engine oil, leading to overheating and potential engine damage.  Coolant loss without visible external leaks is a key symptom.
    * Solution: Replacement of the water pump, which often requires significant engine disassembly, including timing chain replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Camshaft Synchronizer Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loud chirping or squealing noise coming from the engine. Can lead to drivability issues or a no-start condition.
    * Solution: Replacement of the camshaft synchronizer assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin 6-Speed Automatic (TF-81SC)**

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or shaking during acceleration, especially at lower speeds.  Transmission slipping or failure to shift properly.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.  Flushing the transmission fluid and inspecting for debris is also recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, or complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some cases, a complete transmission replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on severity and repair approach)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps.  Poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front strut mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (per side)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Suspension Sagging**
     * Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. This can cause handling issues and potentially damage other suspension components.
     * Solution: Replacement of rear coil springs and/or shocks.
     * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800
     * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window moves slowly, erratically, or not at all.
    * Solution: Replacement of the power window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 (per window)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inability to control air temperature properly (e.g., only hot or only cold air). Clicking noise from behind the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacement of the blend door actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 (depending on location and labor involved)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery warning light, dimming headlights, slow or no engine start.
    * Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof fails to open or close properly, makes excessive noise, or leaks.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercury Sable, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues, especially related to the timing chain and water pump, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems are also a potential concern. While suspension and electrical issues are less severe, they can still contribute to overall ownership costs. Prospective buyers should have a mechanic inspect the vehicle for these potential problems before purchasing. The severity ranges from minor electrical issues costing a few hundred dollars to major engine repairs that can exceed $2,000.
