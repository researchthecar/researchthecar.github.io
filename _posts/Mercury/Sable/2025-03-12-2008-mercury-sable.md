The 2008 Mercury Sable is a full-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was available with a single engine option: a 3.5L Duratec V6 engine producing 263 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque, paired with an Aisin AW TF-81SC 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sable's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample passenger space. Some common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling, dated interior materials, and less-than-thrilling handling.

**Engine**

**3.5L Duratec V6**

* **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine rattling noise, especially upon startup, potential for check engine light with codes related to camshaft timing. Worn or stretched timing chains can cause poor engine performance and, if severe, can lead to engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacement of timing chains, tensioners, guides, and potentially camshaft sprockets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Water Pump Failure (Internal)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The water pump is located internally within the engine. Leaking coolant into the engine oil is a common symptom. Overheating can occur if the coolant level drops too low.
    * Solution: Replacement of the water pump, which requires significant engine disassembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Throttle Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light. This is often due to carbon buildup on the throttle plate and sensor malfunction.
    * Solution: Cleaning the throttle body or replacing it entirely.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin AW TF-81SC 6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during light acceleration, especially in lower gears. Can also cause stalling or harsh shifting.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, potentially with a rebuilt or remanufactured unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, harsh shifting, or slipping between gears.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in turns, and bottoming out over bumps. Leaking fluid from the struts/shocks is a visual indicator.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn struts/shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    * Solution: Replacement of sway bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window operates slowly or not at all. May hear clicking from the motor but no movement.
    * Solution: Replacement of the power window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door locks do not function properly, either not locking/unlocking with the remote or switch, or making a grinding noise.
    * Solution: Replacement of the door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per door)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on rocker panels, wheel wells, and lower door sections, especially in areas where road salt is used.
    * Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clicking or flapping noises from behind the dashboard, inconsistent air temperature from vents (e.g., hot air on one side, cold on the other).
    * Solution: Replacement of the blend door actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Mercury Sable, while generally a reliable vehicle, can suffer from issues primarily related to its engine and transmission. The timing chain and water pump concerns within the engine can be quite costly to repair. Issues like torque converter shudder and valve body failure in the transmission are also common. The suspension and electrical systems also have their issues, but are generally less costly to repair. The rust that is likely occurring by this point in the vehicles life is also going to be a costly issue to take care of, depending on the severity. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
