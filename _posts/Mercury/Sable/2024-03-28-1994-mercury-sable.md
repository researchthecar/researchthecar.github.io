**Introduction:**

The 1994 Mercury Sable is a full-size sedan offered with a choice of two engine and transmission combinations: a 3.0L V6 with a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 3.8L V6 with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0L V6 produces 140 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.8L V6 generates 160 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque.
