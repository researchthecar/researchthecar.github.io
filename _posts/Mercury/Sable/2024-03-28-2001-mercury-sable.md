**Introduction:**

The 2001 Mercury Sable is a midsize sedan that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 3.0L V6 that produced 155 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 3.4L V6 that produced 180 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.
