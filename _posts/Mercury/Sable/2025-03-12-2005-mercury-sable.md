The 2005 Mercury Sable is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. The 2005 Sable offered two engine options: a 3.0L Vulcan V6 producing 155 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duratec 24V V6 producing 200 hp and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Sable for its reliability, smooth ride, and affordability. Common complaints included unimpressive fuel economy and a somewhat dated interior design.
