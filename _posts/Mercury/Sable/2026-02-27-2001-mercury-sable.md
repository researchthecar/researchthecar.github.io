### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mercury Sable is a generally dependable vehicle, but like many cars of its age, it is not without its potential issues. Owners should be aware of common problems such as intake manifold gasket leaks and spark plug blowout on the Vulcan V6, or timing chain wear and coolant leaks on the Duratec V6. Transmission issues, particularly with the AX4N/AX4S, can be costly if they arise. Suspension components like ball joints and springs are also wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and window regulators, can be frustrating. Exterior rust, particularly in the lower body panels, and interior wear on seats and HVAC blend doors are also points to consider. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known issues, the Sable can remain a functional and comfortable daily driver.
