### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercury Sable presents a generally solid reliability record for its age, with common issues primarily revolving around the powertrain and suspension components. The V6 engines, particularly the Duratec, can experience timing chain wear, while the automatic transmission may develop torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and springs are also susceptible to wear. Electrical issues such as window regulators and alternators are not uncommon. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor can also fail. Addressing these potential issues proactively can help maintain the Sable's overall reliability and longevity.
