### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mercury Villager, while a practical choice, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and design. The 3.3L V6 engine can suffer from intake manifold leaks and EGR valve problems. The automatic transmission may develop torque converter issues or fluid leaks. Suspension components like ball joints and springs are prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust and issues with sliding door mechanisms are also reported. Interior climate control, specifically the blower motor resistor, and general seat wear are other areas to monitor. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential problems can help maintain the Villager's functionality.
