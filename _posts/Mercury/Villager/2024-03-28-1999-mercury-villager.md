**Summary:**

The 1999 Mercury Villager generally offers reliable performance, but it is not without its issues. The intake manifold gasket failure and supercharger bearing failure (for the supercharged engine) can be costly repairs. Suspension components may require replacement over time, and electrical problems such as alternator failure or battery drain can also arise. Interior issues like power window motor failure and A/C compressor failure are less common but can still impact comfort and convenience.
