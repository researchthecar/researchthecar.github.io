**Introduction**

The 2001 Mercury Villager is a minivan that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The 3.3-liter V6 engine produces 180 horsepower and 205 pound-feet of torque, while the 3.8-liter V6 engine produces 200 horsepower and 225 pound-feet of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual transmission.

The Villager was praised for its roomy interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engines. However, it was also criticized for its poor fuel economy, lack of features, and unreliable transmission.
