The 2001 Mercury Villager is a minivan that aimed to provide a comfortable and practical family vehicle. It was available with a 3.3-liter V6 engine, producing 170 horsepower and 202 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Villager for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and ease of maneuverability.
