**Introduction**

The 1998 Mercury Mystique is a midsize sedan offered with three engine options: a 2.0L inline-four (125 horsepower, 135 lb-ft of torque), a 2.5L V6 (170 horsepower, 165 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L V6 (200 horsepower, 205 lb-ft of torque). Two transmission options are available: a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. The Mystique is known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and value for money. However, it has received criticism for its lackluster performance and unremarkable driving experience.
