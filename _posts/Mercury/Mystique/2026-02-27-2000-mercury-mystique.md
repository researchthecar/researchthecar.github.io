### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mercury Mystique exhibits some common issues typical for vehicles of its age and platform. The engines, particularly the V6, can be prone to timing chain and coolant leak problems. Automatic transmissions may develop issues with slipping or torque converter problems. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are generally less problematic, specific components like HVAC blower motors and door lock actuators can fail. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and consider a pre-purchase inspection.
