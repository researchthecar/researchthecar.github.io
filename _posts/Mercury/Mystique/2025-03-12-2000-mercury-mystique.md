The 2000 Mercury Mystique was a mid-size sedan offering a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 Zetec engine producing 130 hp and 135 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L Duratec V6 engine producing 170 hp and 165 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Mystique's smooth handling and relatively spacious interior for its class. Common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with certain engine and transmission components, as well as some electrical problems.
