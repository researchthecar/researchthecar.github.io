**Introduction**

The 1999 Mercury Mystique is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It is available with a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission, a 2.5-liter V6 engine with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.0-liter V6 engine with a four-speed automatic transmission.
