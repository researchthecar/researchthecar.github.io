### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercury Cougar presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components are generally robust, specific issues like intake manifold leaks on the 2.0L engines and timing chain tensioner wear on the 2.5L V6 require attention. Automatic transmission issues, particularly fluid leaks and torque converter problems, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear out, and electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern, especially in certain climates. Overall, the Cougar can be a fun and stylish car, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and budget accordingly for maintenance and potential fixes.
