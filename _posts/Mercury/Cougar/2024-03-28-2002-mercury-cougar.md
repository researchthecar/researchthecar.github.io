**Introduction:**

The 2002 Mercury Cougar is a sporty coupe that was available with two engine and transmission options: a 2.5L V6 engine paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.0L V6 engine paired with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5L engine produces 170 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L engine produces 220 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque.
