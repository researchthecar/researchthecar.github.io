The 2002 Mercury Cougar is a sporty, front-wheel-drive coupe known for its sleek styling and relatively affordable price point. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 and a 2.5L V6. The 2.5L V6 produced 170 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Cougar's distinctive design and handling, but common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the engine and electrical system. Dislikes include a cramped rear seat and some cheap interior materials.

**Summary**

The 2002 Mercury Cougar, while stylish, is prone to a number of reliability issues, particularly relating to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Engine coolant leaks and ignition coil failures are common on the V6 engine. Transmission issues are known, specifically regarding erratic shifting. Suspension and electrical faults, such as rear trailing arm bushing and instrument cluster failures, add to the maintenance burden. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, potentially making ownership of a 2002 Cougar an expensive proposition if these issues arise.
