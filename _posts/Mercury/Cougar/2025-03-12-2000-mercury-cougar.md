The 2000 Mercury Cougar was a sporty coupe aiming to recapture the spirit of earlier, more performance-oriented Cougars. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L Zetec inline-4 producing 125 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L Duratec V6 producing 170 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many liked the Cougar for its distinctive styling and relatively affordable price point, but some disliked its limited rear seat space, and some found the base engine underpowered.

**Summary**

The 2000 Mercury Cougar, while stylish, has a range of potential issues, mostly related to wear and tear as it ages. Engine issues with both the 2.0L and 2.5L, along with transmission problems, are common and can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to costly replacements. Suspension and electrical problems are also present. While none of the issues are catastrophic, they can add up, potentially making ownership more expensive as the vehicle ages.
