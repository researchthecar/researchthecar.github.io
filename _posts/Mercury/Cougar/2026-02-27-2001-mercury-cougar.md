### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mercury Cougar is a generally reliable vehicle, but like many cars of its age, it is prone to certain issues. The most common problems tend to be related to the intake manifold gaskets (especially on the V6), window regulators, and occasional electrical gremlins like instrument cluster failures. Suspension components such as ball joints and tie rod ends can also wear out. While the manual transmission is typically robust, the automatic transmission may exhibit harsh shifting. Owners should be aware of potential rust issues on lower body panels. With proactive maintenance and addressing these common issues, the Cougar can remain a fun and dependable car.
