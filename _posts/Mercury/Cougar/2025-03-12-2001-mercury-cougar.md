The 2001 Mercury Cougar was a sporty coupe aiming for a blend of style and affordability. It offered two engine options: a 2.0L Zetec inline-4 producing 125 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L Duratec V6 delivering 170 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Cougar's unique styling and relatively nimble handling. Common complaints centered around reliability issues, particularly with certain engine components and the car's age-related wear and tear.
