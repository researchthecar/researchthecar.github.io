## 1991 Mercury Tracer

The 1991 Mercury Tracer is a compact sedan that was available with two engine options: a 1.9L inline-four and a 2.0L V6. Both engines were paired with a five-speed manual transmission or a three-speed automatic transmission. The Tracer was known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and roomy interior. However, it also had some common issues, which are listed below.

### Engine

**1.9L Inline-Four**

- **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include overheating, low coolant levels, and white smoke from the exhaust. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400
- **Timing belt tensioner failure:** The timing belt tensioner can fail, causing the timing belt to slip or break. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine and difficulty starting. The solution is to replace the timing belt tensioner. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500

**2.0L V6**

- **Cylinder head gasket failure:** The cylinder head gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include overheating, low coolant levels, and white smoke from the exhaust. The solution is to replace the cylinder head gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000

### Transmission

**Five-Speed Manual Transmission**

- **Shifter linkage failure:** The shifter linkage can fail, making it difficult or impossible to shift gears. Symptoms include a loose or sloppy shifter and difficulty shifting into certain gears. The solution is to replace the shifter linkage. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200

**Three-Speed Automatic Transmission**

- **Transmission slippage:** The transmission can slip, causing a loss of power or difficulty accelerating. Symptoms include a shuddering or slipping feeling when shifting gears. The solution is to replace the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500

### Suspension

- **Struts failure:** The struts can fail, causing the vehicle to handle poorly and ride rough. Symptoms include a bouncing or floating ride, uneven tire wear, and difficulty steering. The solution is to replace the struts. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $800

### Electrical

- **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the vehicle to lose power. Symptoms include dim headlights, a dead battery, and a warning light on the dashboard. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500
- **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, making it difficult or impossible to start the vehicle. Symptoms include a clicking noise when trying to start the engine and a lack of engine response. The solution is to replace the starter. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400

### Exterior

- **Rust:** The Tracer is prone to rust, especially on the body panels and undercarriage. Symptoms include bubbling or peeling paint and holes in the metal. The solution is to have the rust repaired or replaced. Estimated cost to fix: Varies depending on the severity of the rust

### Interior

- **Dashboard cracks:** The dashboard can crack over time, especially in hot climates. The solution is to replace the dashboard or have it repaired. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500+
- **Door panel sag:** The door panels can sag over time, causing them to rattle or come loose. The solution is to replace the door panel clips or screws. Estimated cost to fix: $50 - $100

### Summary

The 1991 Mercury Tracer is a reliable and affordable compact sedan with a few common issues. The most severe and expensive issue is transmission slippage, which can cost up to $2,500 to fix. Other issues, such as intake manifold gasket failure and alternator failure, are less severe and less expensive to fix. Overall, the Tracer is a good value for its price, but it is important to be aware of these potential issues before purchasing one.
