**Summary**
For the 1997 Mercury Tracer, the issues range in severity from minor and affordable to major and expensive. The engine, suspension, and electrical systems seem to have the most common and costly issues, while the exterior and interior have relatively few problems. Some of the issues, such as the timing belt failure and intake manifold gasket failure, can lead to significant engine damage if not addressed promptly. Overall, while the Tracer can be a reliable car with proper maintenance, it is essential to be aware of these potential issues to make informed decisions about purchasing and ownership costs.
