**1998 Mercury Tracer**

The 1998 Mercury Tracer is a compact sedan that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 2.0-liter inline-four, which produced 110 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.5-liter V6 was optional, and it produced 170 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.
