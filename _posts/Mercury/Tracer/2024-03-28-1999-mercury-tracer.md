## 1999 Mercury Tracer

The 1999 Mercury Tracer is a compact sedan offered with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 and a 2.5L V6. The 2.0L engine produces 110 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.5L engine generates 125 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Tracer was praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior, but criticized for its lack of power and outdated design.
