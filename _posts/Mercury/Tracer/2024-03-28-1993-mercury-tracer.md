**Introduction**

The 1993 Mercury Tracer is a compact sedan that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 1.9L four-cylinder that produced 90 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 2.0L V6 that produced 118 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

Owners of the 1993 Mercury Tracer generally praise the vehicle for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and reliability. However, there are some common issues that have been reported with the car.

**Engine**

* **1.9L Four-Cylinder**
    * **Head gasket failure:** Blown head gaskets are a common problem on the 1.9L four-cylinder engine. Symptoms include coolant leaks, overheating, and white smoke from the exhaust. A blown head gasket can be repaired by replacing the head gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $800 - $1,200+
    * **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can also fail on the 1.9L four-cylinder engine. Symptoms include a vacuum leak, which can cause rough idling, stalling, and decreased performance. An intake manifold gasket can be repaired by replacing the gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500+
    * **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt is a critical component of the engine that synchronizes the timing of the valves and pistons. If the timing belt fails, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. On the 1.9L four-cylinder engine, the timing belt should be replaced every 60,000 miles. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $700+
* **2.0L V6**
    * **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can also fail on the 2.0L V6 engine. Symptoms include a vacuum leak, which can cause rough idling, stalling, and decreased performance. An intake manifold gasket can be repaired by replacing the gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500+
    * **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain is a similar component to the timing belt, but it is typically more durable. However, it is still possible for the timing chain to fail on the 2.0L V6 engine. Symptoms of timing chain failure include a rattling noise from the engine, decreased performance, and eventually, engine failure. A timing chain can be repaired by replacing the chain and related components. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

* **Five-Speed Manual Transmission**
    * **Synchronizer failure:** Synchronizers are components in the transmission that help to smooth gear shifts. If a synchronizer fails, it can make it difficult or impossible to shift into a particular gear. Synchronizers can be repaired by replacing the worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $800+
    * **Clutch failure:** The clutch is a component in the transmission that transfers power from the engine to the transmission. If the clutch fails, it can cause the car to stall or lose power. A clutch can be repaired by replacing the worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $800+
* **Four-Speed Automatic Transmission**
    * **Transmission fluid leak:** Transmission fluid leaks are a common problem on the four-speed automatic transmission. Symptoms include slipping gears, delayed shifts, and difficulty shifting. A transmission fluid leak can be repaired by replacing the leaking part. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+
    * **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter is a component in the transmission that helps to transmit power from the engine to the transmission. If the torque converter fails, it can cause the car to lose power or stall. A torque converter can be repaired by replacing the worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** The struts are components of the suspension system that absorb shock and keep the tires in contact with the road. If a strut fails, it can cause the car to bounce or handle poorly. Struts can be repaired by replacing the worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $400 - $600+ per strut
* **Ball joint failure:** Ball joints are components of the suspension system that allow the wheels to move up and down. If a ball joint fails, it can cause the wheel to wobble or lose alignment. Ball joints can be repaired by replacing the worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+ per ball joint

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator is a component of the electrical system that charges the battery. If the alternator fails, it can cause the battery to discharge and the car to lose power. An alternator can be repaired by replacing the worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $800+
* **Starter failure:** The starter is a component of the electrical system that starts the engine. If the starter fails, it can prevent the car from starting. A starter can be repaired by replacing the worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500+

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** Rust is a common problem on the 1993 Mercury Tracer. Rust can occur on the body panels, the frame, and the suspension components. Rust can be repaired by removing the rust and applying a protective coating. Estimated cost to fix: Varies depending on the severity of the rust
* **Door lock failure:** The door locks on the 1993 Mercury Tracer can fail. Symptoms include difficulty locking or unlocking the doors. Door locks can be repaired by replacing the worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+ per door

**Interior**

* **Seat upholstery wear:** The seat upholstery on the 1993 Mercury Tracer can wear out over time. Symptoms include fading, tearing, and cracking. Seat upholstery can be repaired by replacing the worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+ per seat
* **Dashboard cracking:** The dashboard on the 1993 Mercury Tracer can crack over time. Symptoms include a cracked or discolored dashboard. A cracked dashboard can be repaired by replacing the dashboard. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $500+

**Summary**

The 1993 Mercury Tracer is a reliable and fuel-efficient car, but it is not without its problems. Some of the most common issues include head gasket failure, intake manifold gasket failure, and timing belt failure. These issues can be expensive to repair, so it is important to factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering purchasing a used Tracer.

Overall, the 1993 Mercury Tracer is a good choice for budget-minded consumers who are looking for a reliable and fuel-efficient car. However, it is important to be aware of the potential problems that can occur with this vehicle.
