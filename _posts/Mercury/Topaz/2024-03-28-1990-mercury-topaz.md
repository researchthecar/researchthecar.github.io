**Introduction**

The 1990 Mercury Topaz is a mid-size sedan that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 2.3-liter four-cylinder that produced 98 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 3.0-liter V6 that produced 140 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Topaz was praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and affordable price. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power and poor fuel economy.
