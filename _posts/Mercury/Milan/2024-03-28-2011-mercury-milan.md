## 2011 Mercury Milan

The 2011 Mercury Milan is a midsize sedan that was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that produced 175 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. A 3.0-liter V6 was also available, producing 240 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque.
