# 2010 Mercury Milan

### Overview
The 2010 Mercury Milan, a mid-size sedan, offered a blend of comfort and practicality. As the final model year for the Mercury brand, it represented a mature platform with generally decent reliability. Buyers could choose between a standard 2.5L four-cylinder engine or a more potent 3.0L V6, both paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While not without its minor quirks, the Milan generally held up well for its era, with most reported issues being relatively minor and manageable. Owners appreciated its comfortable ride and spacious interior, making it a solid choice for daily commuting and family use. However, like many vehicles of this age, specific component failures can occur, particularly as mileage increases.
