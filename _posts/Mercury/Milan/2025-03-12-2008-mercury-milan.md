The 2008 Mercury Milan is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. Engine options include a 2.3L Duratec inline-4 producing 160 hp and 156 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 221 hp and 205 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid 2.3L inline-4 producing 155 hp and 136 lb-ft of torque. The 2.3L I4 engines are paired with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0L V6 is exclusively paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Milan for its comfortable interior and smooth ride, while some criticize its somewhat bland styling and lack of sporty handling.

**Engine**

* **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes may point to cylinder misfires.
    * Solution: Replacing faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors can resolve the issue. Inspecting and cleaning the mass airflow sensor may also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the parts needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Purge Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty filling the fuel tank, check engine light illuminated, and rough idle.
    * Solution: Replacing the purge valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $150
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duratec V6**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are commonly found around the valve cover gaskets. A burning smell may also be present.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (2.3L I4)**

* **Erratic Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, especially between gears. The transmission may also slip.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement might resolve minor issues. However, if the problem persists, a valve body repair or replacement may be necessary. In severe cases, a full transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (3.0L V6)**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibration felt during light acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This is often caused by wear in the torque converter.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush with a fluid specifically designed to reduce shudder may temporarily alleviate the issue. Replacing the torque converter is the more permanent solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $800+ (torque converter replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Ball Joints/Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Steering may also feel loose or imprecise.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints and/or control arm bushings.

**Summary**

The 2008 Mercury Milan has some common issues to be aware of, particularly with the engine and transmission. The 2.3L I4 engine has some common issues with misfires while the 3.0L V6 may develop oil leaks. The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience erratic shifting, and the 6-speed automatic can have torque converter shudder. Suspension issues like worn ball joints are also possible. While most of these issues are not catastrophic, they can lead to expensive repairs if left unaddressed. The estimated cost to fix these problems ranges from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
