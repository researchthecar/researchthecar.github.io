The 2007 Mercury Milan is a mid-size sedan that offered a blend of comfort, style, and reliability. It was available with two engine options: a 2.3L Duratec inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 221 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. The inline-4 was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 was paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Milan for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and attractive styling. Common criticisms include less than stellar fuel economy (especially with the V6) and some reports of reliability issues, particularly with the automatic transmissions.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercury Milan, while generally a comfortable and stylish sedan, has its share of potential issues. Engine misfires can occur on both engine options, requiring ignition system or fuel injector repairs. Transmission issues, particularly with the 6-speed automatic paired with the V6, can be costly to repair. Suspension components wear out over time, leading to ride quality and handling issues. Electrical problems, such as power window failures and battery drain, can also occur. Early signs of rust are common on the exterior. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing a 2007 Mercury Milan.
