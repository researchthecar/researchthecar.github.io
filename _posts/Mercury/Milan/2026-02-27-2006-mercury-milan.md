### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercury Milan generally presents a reliable profile, particularly with its powertrain options. The 2.3L I4 and 3.0L V6 engines, along with the 5-speed automatic transmission, do not show significant widespread failure patterns. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with suspension components, specifically front control arm bushings, which can lead to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and intermittent instrument cluster problems, are also noted. Interior comfort systems, like the HVAC blower motor resistor, can occasionally fail. Overall, the Milan is a reasonably dependable vehicle, but proactive inspection of suspension and electrical systems is advisable.
