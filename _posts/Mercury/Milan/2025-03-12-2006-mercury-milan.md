The 2006 Mercury Milan marked Mercury's entry into the mid-size sedan market, sharing its platform with the Ford Fusion. The Milan offered a blend of comfort and style aimed at a more discerning buyer than the Ford counterpart. Engine options included a 2.3L Duratec inline-4 producing around 160 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing around 221 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Milan's comfortable ride and attractive interior, but some criticized its fuel economy and occasional reliability issues.
