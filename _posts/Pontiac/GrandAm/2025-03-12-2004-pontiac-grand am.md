The 2004 Pontiac Grand Am was a popular compact car known for its sporty styling and affordable price. It was available with two engine options: a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4L LA1 V6 producing 170 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Grand Am for its exterior design, comfortable ride, and decent fuel economy. However, common complaints included electrical issues, interior trim quality, and some reliability concerns with certain engine components.

**Summary**

The 2004 Pontiac Grand Am, while offering a stylish exterior and comfortable ride for its time, does suffer from some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with intake manifold leaks (especially on the V6) and coolant leaks, are prevalent. Transmission issues, such as slipping and hard shifting, can also be costly. Electrical problems, including power window motor failures and security system glitches, are frequently reported. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints tend to wear out over time, contributing to noise and handling issues. Interior issues such as headliner sagging and dashboard cracking are common, although generally cosmetic. While not all Grand Ams will experience all these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in potential repair costs.
