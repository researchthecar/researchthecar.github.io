**Summary**

The 2005 Pontiac Grand Am is plagued by a mix of engine, transmission, electrical, and suspension issues that can lead to costly repairs. The intake manifold gasket and coolant elbows on the 3.4L V6 are common and relatively inexpensive to fix if caught early. Transmission issues can be severe, requiring costly replacements or rebuilds. Electrical problems such as window failure and ignition switch issues are common and also relatively inexpensive to fix. Suspension issues, while not necessarily debilitating, can affect handling and require attention. The cosmetic issues like dashboard cracking and door handle breakage, while annoying, typically don't impact the car's functionality. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor repair costs into their budget.
