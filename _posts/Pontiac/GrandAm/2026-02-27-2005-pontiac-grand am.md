### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Pontiac Grand Am can be a budget-friendly option, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 3.4L V6 engine is more prone to intake manifold gasket leaks than the 2.2L Ecotec, though both can experience oil leaks. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4T40-E/4T45-E, may develop shifting problems or torque converter issues over time. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are typical wear items that may need replacement. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and power windows, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant concern in certain climates, and interior components like the dashboard can degrade. Regular maintenance and inspection for these specific issues are recommended for owners.
