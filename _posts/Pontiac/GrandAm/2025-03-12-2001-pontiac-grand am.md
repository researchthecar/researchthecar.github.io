**Summary:** The 2001 Pontiac Grand Am is known for some recurring issues, particularly related to the engine (intake manifold gasket failures on both the 2.2L and 3.4L engines), transmission (shift solenoid issues), and electrical system (power windows, security system). Suspension components such as strut mounts and coil springs can also fail. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs. Cost of repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific issue and the shop doing the work, but several common problems can be addressed for a few hundred dollars. More extensive repairs, such as intake manifold gasket replacement or transmission work, can cost significantly more.
