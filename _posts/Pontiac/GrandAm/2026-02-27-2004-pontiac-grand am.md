### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Pontiac Grand Am presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's intake manifold gaskets and, for the V6, potential head gasket failures. Automatic transmission problems like slipping and torque converter issues are also noted. Suspension components, particularly struts and ball joints, can wear out, leading to ride and handling concerns. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and failing window regulators, can be frustrating. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior issues like HVAC blend door failures and dashboard cracking are also points to consider. While not inherently unreliable, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and prioritize thorough pre-purchase inspections.
