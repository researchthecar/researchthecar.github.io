### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Pontiac G4, while offering decent value, presents a few common reliability concerns that owners should be aware of. The Ecotec engines, particularly the 2.2L variant, can be prone to oil consumption and timing chain issues. Automatic transmissions may develop problems with harsh shifting or slipping. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems, can occur. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure are also reported. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential problems are key to maintaining the G4's reliability.
