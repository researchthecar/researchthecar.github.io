- **Cost:** $600 - $1200

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Low oil level between changes, blue smoke from exhaust.
- **Solution:** Can be due to worn piston rings or valve seals; may require engine rebuild or specific repairs.
- **Cost:** $800 - $2500+


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic (4T40-E/4T45-E)
**Harsh Shifting / Slipping**
- **Symptoms:** Jerky gear changes, delayed engagement, engine revving without acceleration.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1500+


### 5-Speed Manual
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Clutch kit replacement (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $500 - $900


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn suspension components.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Strut Mounts**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noises when turning, especially at low speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of strut mounts.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Faults**
- **Symptoms:** Malfunctioning power windows, door locks, interior lights, or dashboard warning lights.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


### Alternator
**Failure**

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Pontiac G4 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components like the Ecotec engines are generally robust, specific issues such as oil leaks and, on the 2.2L, timing chain concerns can arise. Automatic transmissions may experience shifting problems, and manual clutches have a finite lifespan. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM, and exterior rust are also points to consider. Interior wear is typical for its age. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of these common issues can help maintain the G4's functionality and value.
