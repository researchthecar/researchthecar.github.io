The 2005 Pontiac G4, also known as the Pontiac Pursuit in Canada, was a compact car offered in sedan and coupe body styles. While praised for its fuel efficiency and affordability, it also had some common problem areas. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the G4's sporty styling and responsive handling for an economy car, but reliability concerns and interior quality were frequent criticisms.
