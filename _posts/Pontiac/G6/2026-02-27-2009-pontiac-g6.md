### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Pontiac G6 presents a mixed reliability picture. While its powertrains are generally adequate, owners should be vigilant for potential issues such as intake manifold leaks on V6 engines and oil consumption on the 2.4L four-cylinder. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, are not uncommon and can be costly to repair. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may require attention as the vehicle ages. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and power windows, can be frustrating. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and convertible top mechanisms require maintenance. Interior issues like cracking dashboards and HVAC blend door failures are also reported. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, the G6 requires proactive maintenance and awareness of common problem areas to ensure continued reliability.
