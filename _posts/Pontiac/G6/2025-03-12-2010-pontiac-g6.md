**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**

    *   Solution: The issue can be addressed with a piston ring replacement or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain on the 2.4L engine can stretch or fail, leading to rough running, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioner, and guides is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold gasket can leak, causing a vacuum leak, rough idle, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gasket is the standard repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L, the 3.6L V6 can experience timing chain wear or failure, resulting in similar symptoms: rough running, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides is the usual repair.
