### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Pontiac G6 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components are generally robust, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as transmission slipping, particularly with the automatic transmissions, and potential leaks from engine gaskets and oil cooler lines, especially on V6 models.
