### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Pontiac G6 presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the transmission, particularly the 4-speed automatic, which can experience harsh shifting or torque converter problems. Engine-wise, the V6 options are prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and general oil leaks. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or window regulators, are also reported. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear out, leading to ride quality issues and noises. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. While not universally problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these common failure points and factor in potential repair costs.
