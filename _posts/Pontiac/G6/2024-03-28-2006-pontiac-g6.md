**Introduction:**

The 2006 Pontiac G6 is a midsize sedan available in three trims: base, GT, and GTP. The base trim comes equipped with a 2.4L inline-four engine, while the GT and GTP trims feature a 3.5L V6 engine. The 2.4L engine produces 169 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5L engine produces 200 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The G6 was praised for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and agile handling, but some owners have reported various issues with the vehicle.

**Engine**
- **2.4L Inline-Four**
    - **Oil leaks:** Oil leaks may occur from the camshaft cover, oil pan, and valve cover gaskets. Symptoms include visible oil spots on the engine or under the vehicle.
    - **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak. Symptoms include a rough idle, loss of power, and poor fuel economy.
    - **Timing chain rattle:** The timing chain can stretch over time, resulting in a rattling noise at startup or acceleration.
- **3.5L V6**
    - **Valve timing solenoid failure:** The variable valve timing solenoid can fail, affecting engine performance. Symptoms include poor acceleration, rough idling, and increased fuel consumption.
    - **Camshaft position sensor failure:** The camshaft position sensor can fail, leading to engine starting problems, reduced power, and illuminated check engine lights.
    - **Rear main seal leak:** The rear main seal can leak oil, causing visible oil stains on the back of the engine.

**Transmission**
- **2.4L Inline-Four**
    - **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip out of gear or experience harsh shifting.
    - **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing shuddering, slippage, or overheating.

**Suspension**
- **Front struts:** The front struts can wear out prematurely, leading to a bumpy ride and poor handling.
- **Sway bar links:** The sway bar links can fail, causing knocking noises and decreased stability.
- **Rear shocks:** The rear shocks can leak or fail, resulting in a bouncy or unstable ride.

**Electrical**
- **Ignition switch failure:** The ignition switch can fail, preventing the vehicle from starting or causing it to stall while driving.
- **Battery drain:** The battery may drain prematurely due to faulty wiring or electrical components.
- **Headlight switch failure:** The headlight switch can malfunction, causing the headlights to flicker or not come on at all.

**Exterior**
- **Door handle failure:** The door handles can break or become stuck, making it difficult to open the doors.
- **Fender liners:** The fender liners can come loose, causing rattling noises or allowing dirt and debris to enter the engine bay.

**Interior**
- **Center console rattle:** The center console may rattle or buzz, particularly on rough roads.
- **Power window switch failure:** The power window switches can malfunction, preventing the windows from operating properly.
- **HVAC blend door actuator failure:** The HVAC blend door actuator can fail, affecting the climate control system's ability to adjust temperature.

**Summary**

The 2006 Pontiac G6 has been reported to have issues with its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, exterior, and interior components. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the specific problem and the parts involved. Some of the issues, such as oil leaks and timing chain rattle, may require major repairs at a cost of several hundred to thousands of dollars. However, other issues, like door handle failure or center console rattle, are typically less costly to fix. Overall, the G6 has a moderate level of reliability compared to other vehicles in its class, but it's essential for potential buyers to be aware of potential issues and factor in the cost of repairs into their purchasing decision.
