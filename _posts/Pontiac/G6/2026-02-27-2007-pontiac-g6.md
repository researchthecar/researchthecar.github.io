### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Pontiac G6 presents a mixed reliability profile. While some powertrain options, like the 3.9L V6 and the 6-speed automatic transmission, appear to be relatively robust, the 3.5L V6 and the 4-speed automatic transmission have documented issues such as intake manifold leaks, oil leaks, and transmission problems like harsh shifting and torque converter failures. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are also common wear items. Electrical gremlins, including window regulators and BCM issues, can be a source of frustration. Exterior rust and interior wear are also points to consider. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs, especially for vehicles with higher mileage or less consistent maintenance history.
