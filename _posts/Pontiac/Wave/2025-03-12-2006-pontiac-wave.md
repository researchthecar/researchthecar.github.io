The 2006 Pontiac Wave was a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It was available as a sedan and a hatchback. It came standard with a 1.6L inline-4 cylinder engine, producing around 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. While appreciated for its fuel economy and low price point, common criticisms included its basic interior, lackluster performance, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**
The 2006 Pontiac Wave is an aging vehicle and like most aging vehicles, it is showing its age in terms of reliability. The issues range in severity and cost, from relatively inexpensive sensor replacements to more costly transmission repairs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase. Rust is also a major concern for vehicles of this age, and should be considered before purchase.
