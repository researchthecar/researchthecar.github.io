The 2008 Pontiac Wave, also known as the Chevrolet Aveo in some markets, is a subcompact car that offers affordability and fuel efficiency. For the 2008 model year, it was primarily offered with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing around 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Wave's low price point and good fuel economy, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. Common complaints revolve around its basic interior, modest performance, and reliability issues.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the 1.6L engine can start to consume an excessive amount of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored regularly. Symptoms include the need to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is essential. If consumption is excessive, potential solutions include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires can occur due to faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or issues with the fuel injectors. Symptoms include rough idling, poor acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the misfire using an OBD-II scanner. Replace faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors as needed.

**Summary**

The 2008 Pontiac Wave, while an economical choice, can be prone to several issues. Engine problems, like excessive oil consumption and misfires, can lead to costly repairs, as can issues with the automatic transmission. Suspension wear and electrical glitches are also common. While individual repair costs may not be excessively high, the frequency of these issues can make the overall ownership experience less desirable. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potential maintenance costs.
