The 2007 Pontiac Wave was a subcompact car also known as the Chevrolet Aveo in other markets. It was available as a sedan and a hatchback. The engine option was a 1.6L Inline-4 Ecotec engine producing approximately 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It came with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Wave for its fuel efficiency and affordability, but disliked its basic interior, limited features, and somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Summary**

The 2007 Pontiac Wave, while an economical choice, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues like EVAP leaks and coolant leaks can lead to moderate repair costs. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, can be more expensive. Suspension components wear out over time, and electrical issues such as window motor failures are also common. Rust is a concern in certain climates. Overall, the potential for moderate to high repair costs should be considered when evaluating this vehicle.
