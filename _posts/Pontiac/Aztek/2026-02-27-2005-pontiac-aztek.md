### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Pontiac Aztek, while offering a unique and practical package, is known to have several potential reliability concerns. The 3.4L V6 engine can suffer from intake manifold gasket and oil cooler line leaks. The 4-speed automatic transmission, particularly the 4T65E, is susceptible to torque converter issues and TCM failures. Suspension components like struts, shocks, and rear wheel bearings may require attention. Electrical gremlins, including BCM malfunctions and premature alternator failure, are also reported. Exterior rust and interior issues like HVAC blend door actuators and power window regulators are common wear items that can develop problems. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs in these areas to maintain the Aztek's functionality.
