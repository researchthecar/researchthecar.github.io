The 2008 Pontiac G5 is a compact car that was available as a coupe. It was praised for its sporty styling and fuel efficiency. However, some owners have reported issues with reliability. Engine options included a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 148 hp and 152 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 173 hp and 163 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners typically dislike the lower quality interior components and some of the reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**

* **Engine Misfires/Rough Running**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, check engine light illuminated. Often caused by worn or faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s), spark plugs, or fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the number of parts that need replacing and the mechanic's labor rate.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks originating from the water pump, thermostat housing, or radiator. Low coolant levels, overheating, and visible leaks are common symptoms.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking component (water pump, thermostat housing, or radiator).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the source of the leak and labor rate.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Pontiac G5 can be an affordable and stylish choice, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine problems, particularly with timing chains and oil consumption on the 2.4L, can be costly. Transmission issues are also relatively prevalent and may lead to expensive repairs. Other common problems like suspension noise and electrical failures are less severe but should still be considered. While the initial purchase price might be attractive, it's important to budget for potential maintenance and repairs.
