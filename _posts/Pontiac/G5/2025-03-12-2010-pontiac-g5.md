The 2010 Pontiac G5 is a compact car that was offered in coupe and sedan body styles. It was available with two engine options: a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 155 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 164 horsepower and 159 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the G5's fuel efficiency and affordability. Common complaints include the bland interior and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.2L Ecotec Inline-4**
*   **Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The IMRC valve can fail, leading to a check engine light and reduced performance, especially at lower RPMs. The car may hesitate or stumble during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IMRC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Actuator Solenoid Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling, reduced power, and a check engine light. The engine may also make rattling noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft position actuator solenoid valve(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **High Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably decreasing oil levels between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: This can range from replacing the PCV valve, to replacing valve stem seals, or piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV Valve) - $3000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or delayed shifts between gears, slipping out of gear, or failure to shift properly. Can be more pronounced when cold.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change may help, but often requires valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Fluid Change) - $3000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Coil Spring Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A clunking or rattling noise from the rear suspension, especially over bumps. The vehicle may sag on one side. Visual inspection will reveal a broken coil spring.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the broken coil spring(s). It is recommended to replace both rear springs at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension when turning or going over bumps. Reduced steering response and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts. Often done when replacing the struts themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (Struts and Mounts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Switch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Key gets stuck in the ignition, car doesn't start, or the engine stalls unexpectedly. This is related to a larger GM ignition switch recall.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This should be covered under recall if related to the original GM ignition switch defect. If not covered, $200 - $400.
    *   Recalls: Several recalls related to the ignition switch, check NHTSA website with the VIN to confirm applicability: 14V047000, 14V053000, 14V153000, 14V355000

*   **Fuel Level Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel gauge reads inaccurately or erratically, even when the fuel tank is full. Check Engine Light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel level sensor, which is usually integrated with the fuel pump assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600

**Summary**

The 2010 Pontiac G5 has a range of potential issues. The most concerning are related to the engine (high oil consumption in the 2.4L) and transmission (harsh shifting/slipping in the 4-speed automatic), which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, especially those involving the ignition switch, are also significant. Suspension and interior problems, while less severe, contribute to the overall ownership experience and potential repair costs. Pre-purchase inspections are recommended to identify existing or potential issues.
