The 2007 Pontiac G5 was a compact car offered as a coupe or sedan. It's generally regarded as a budget-friendly vehicle with decent fuel economy. Some owners appreciate its sporty styling, while others find the interior materials cheap and the ride quality harsh. The G5 came with two engine options: a 2.2L Ecotec inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
