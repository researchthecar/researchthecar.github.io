### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Pontiac G5 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the manual transmission is generally robust, the automatic transmission can experience issues with harsh shifting. Engine-wise, both the 2.2L and 2.4L Ecotec engines have reported problems, with oil leaks and timing chain concerns being more common on the 2.2L, and oil consumption and VVT issues on the 2.4L. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are typical wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and ABS sensors, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. Overall, the G5 can be a reliable car if well-maintained, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
