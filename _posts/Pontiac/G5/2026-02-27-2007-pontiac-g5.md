### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Pontiac G5 presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the Ecotec engines, particularly oil leaks and potential timing chain problems, as well as automatic transmission concerns like harsh shifting. Suspension components, especially struts and sway bar links, can wear out, leading to ride quality issues. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or ignition switch, are also reported. Exterior rust and interior wear are factors to consider, especially on older models. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and factor in potential repair costs for a vehicle of this age.
