### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Pontiac G3 is a basic subcompact that generally performs as expected for its price point. Common issues tend to revolve around wear items that can be exacerbated by age, such as suspension components (struts, ball joints) and clutch wear on manual transmissions. Engine-related problems like oil and coolant leaks are also reported, often stemming from aging seals and gaskets. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and instrument clusters, can occur. Exterior rust, especially in areas prone to road salt, is a concern for older models. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these common issues, especially as the vehicle ages. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate more significant problems and costs.
