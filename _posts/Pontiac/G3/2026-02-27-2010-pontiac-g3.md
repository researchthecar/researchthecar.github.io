### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Pontiac G3 is a basic subcompact that generally performs as expected for its price point. Common issues tend to revolve around components that experience significant wear or are prone to failure in many vehicles of this age and class, such as oil and coolant leaks from the 1.6L Ecotec engine, and wear-and-tear on suspension parts like struts and sway bar links. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can manifest as harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, like faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are also noted. While not plagued by catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair costs to maintain the vehicle effectively.
