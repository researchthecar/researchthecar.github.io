The 2009 Pontiac G3, also known as the Daewoo Gentra in some markets, was a subcompact car offered with a single engine option: a 1.6-liter inline-4 producing around 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the G3 for its fuel efficiency and affordability. However, it was commonly criticized for its lackluster performance, basic interior, and somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Summary**
The 2009 Pontiac G3 has a range of potential issues, with some being more common than others. Engine-related problems such as EVAP leaks and O2 sensor failures can lead to check engine lights and reduced fuel economy. Transmission issues can cause rough shifting, while suspension problems can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical issues, such as window motor failures, can be inconvenient. Rust is a potential concern, especially in areas with harsh weather conditions. While some of these issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more costly, potentially requiring extensive repairs.
