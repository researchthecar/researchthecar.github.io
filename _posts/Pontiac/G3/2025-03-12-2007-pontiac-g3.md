The 2007 Pontiac G3, also known as the Daewoo Gentra or Aveo in other markets, was a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. The 2007 G3 was equipped with a 1.6L Inline-4 engine producing around 103 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the G3 for its price point and fuel economy, but commonly disliked its somewhat unrefined ride and basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Check Engine Light Due to Evaporative Emission Control System (EVAP) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and a diagnostic scan reveals codes related to the EVAP system, such as P0440, P0442, P0455. This can be caused by a faulty gas cap, a cracked or damaged EVAP hose, or a malfunctioning purge valve.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace the gas cap if it's damaged. Visually inspect the EVAP hoses for cracks or disconnections and replace as needed. Test the purge valve solenoid for proper operation; replace if faulty. A smoke test can help pinpoint leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes indicating catalytic converter inefficiency (e.g., P0420). Reduced engine performance, decreased fuel economy, and a sulfur smell from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Addressing any underlying engine issues that may have contributed to the converter's failure, such as excessive oil consumption or misfires.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant level, overheating, visible coolant leaks under the vehicle. Common leak points include the water pump, radiator hoses, and radiator itself.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. Replace damaged hoses, water pump, or radiator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, especially between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change using the correct fluid type. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal wear might require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging certain gears, especially 1st or reverse. Grinding noises during shifting.
    *   Solution: Check the clutch cable or hydraulic system for proper adjustment or leaks. The clutch disc may be worn and require replacement. Inspect the shifter linkage for damage or looseness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and excessive body roll. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components such as struts, shocks, sway bar links, and control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Window Regulator**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows that operate slowly, erratically, or not at all. Grinding noises coming from inside the door panel.
