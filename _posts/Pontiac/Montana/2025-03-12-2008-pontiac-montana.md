**Summary**

The 2008 Pontiac Montana can be a practical and spacious minivan, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues. The most significant problems tend to be related to the engine (oil consumption and intake manifold gasket failure), transmission (harsh shifting), and electrical systems (power sliding doors and instrument cluster). These issues can range in cost from a few hundred to several thousand dollars to repair, depending on the severity. Rust on the rocker panels can also be a concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
