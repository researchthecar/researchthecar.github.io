The 2007 Pontiac Montana is a minivan that was offered in both regular and extended lengths. It provided seating for up to seven or eight passengers, depending on the configuration. While generally appreciated for its spaciousness and versatility, the Montana, especially in its later years, became known for certain reliability concerns. The only engine option available for the 2007 Montana was the 3.9L LZ9 V6 engine, rated at 240 hp and 240 lb-ft of torque. This engine was exclusively paired with a 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners liked the Montana for its affordability and practicality, while others disliked its somewhat bland styling and reported issues with reliability and build quality.
