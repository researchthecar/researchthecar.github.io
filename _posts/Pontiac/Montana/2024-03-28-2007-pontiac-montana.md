## 2007 Pontiac Montana

The 2007 Pontiac Montana is a minivan that was available with three engine options: a 3.5L V6, a 3.9L V6, and a 3.9L V6 with FlexFuel capability. The 3.5L V6 produced 201 horsepower and 222 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.9L V6 produced 240 horsepower and 244 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Montana was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engines. However, it was also criticized for its poor fuel economy and outdated design.

### Engine
**3.5L V6**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can cause coolant and oil to leak, leading to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include coolant leaks, oil leaks, and rough idling. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $600+
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to slip and damage the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, an illuminated check engine light, and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $400 - $800+

**3.9L V6**
