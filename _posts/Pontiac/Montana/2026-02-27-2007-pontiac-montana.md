### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Pontiac Montana presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with intake manifold gaskets and, on the 3.9L engine, timing chain concerns. Transmission problems, particularly with the torque converter and solenoids, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and power window failures, can be frustrating and costly. Exterior rust and interior issues like blend door actuators and dashboard cracking are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to reported symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential problems and ensuring a more reliable ownership experience.
