The 2009 Pontiac Montana, a minivan aimed at families, offered a comfortable ride and ample cargo space, which were key selling points for many owners. However, it also faced criticisms regarding its dated styling and less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to competitors. The sole engine option for this model year was a 3.9L V6 engine, producing approximately 240 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
