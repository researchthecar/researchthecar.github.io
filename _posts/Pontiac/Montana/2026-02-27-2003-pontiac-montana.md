### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Pontiac Montana is a generally dependable minivan, but like many vehicles of its age, it is prone to certain common issues. The most frequently reported problems tend to be related to the transmission (torque converter and solenoids), engine gaskets and EGR system, and various electrical components like the BCM and window regulators. Suspension wear, particularly ball joints and springs, is also common. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior climate control actuators can fail. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are often predictable and manageable with proper maintenance and timely attention.
