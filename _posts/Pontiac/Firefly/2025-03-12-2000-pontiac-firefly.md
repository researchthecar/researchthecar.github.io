The 2000 Pontiac Firefly, also known as the Suzuki Swift in many markets, was a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. The primary engine option was a 1.0L Inline-3 producing around 55 horsepower and 58 lb-ft of torque. The car was liked for its simplicity, ease of parking, and low running costs. Common dislikes include its basic features, limited power, and somewhat unrefined driving experience. The available transmissions were a 5-speed manual and a 3-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2000 Pontiac Firefly, while economical, is prone to certain mechanical and electrical issues due to its age. Engine issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to repair, but suspension and transmission repairs can be more costly. Rust is also a significant concern, especially in certain climates. Overall, while parts and labor are relatively inexpensive compared to modern cars, the frequency of repairs due to the vehicle's age can still add up over time.
