**Introduction to the 2007 Pontiac Torrent**

The 2007 Pontiac Torrent is a midsize crossover SUV that was available with two engine options: a 3.4-liter V6 and a 3.6-liter V6. The 3.4-liter engine produced 185 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.6-liter engine produced 234 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Torrent was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price. However, it was criticized for its poor fuel economy and lack of off-road capability.
