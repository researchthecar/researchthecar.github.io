The 2009 Pontiac Torrent was a mid-size SUV offering a blend of practicality and value. It came with two engine options: a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 169 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque and a 3.4L V6 producing 185 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L Ecotec engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.4L V6 was paired with a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Torrent for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and decent fuel economy (especially with the 4-cylinder). However, some common complaints revolved around the vehicle's uninspired styling, perceived lack of power, and some reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between changes. Symptoms included the low oil pressure light illuminating, a burning oil smell, and potentially engine damage if the oil level was not maintained.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings and valve seals can mitigate the issue. Addressing any oil leaks is also crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

**3.4L V6**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks that seep into the engine oil. Milky white oil is seen on the dipstick, and coolant levels drop. Engine may overheat.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.4L)**
*   **No Issues Found**

**5-Speed Automatic (Paired with 3.4L)**
*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting, especially between gears, or slippage during acceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes resolve minor issues. However, more severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid/filter), $500 - $1500 (valve body), $2000 - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Stabilizer Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps. The stabilizer bar links connect the stabilizer bar to the suspension components, and their failure leads to excessive movement and noise.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn stabilizer bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per pair

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows that fail to operate correctly, move slowly, or get stuck. The power window regulator mechanism is prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks that fail to lock or unlock remotely, or that make unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per door

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear wiper stops working or operates intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$250+

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks forming on the dashboard surface, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dash cover or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (cover), $500 - $1500+ (replacement)

* **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The blower motor for the HVAC system only works on certain speed settings, or stops working altogether.
    * Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$150+

**Recalls**

*   **Power Window Switch Short Circuit**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A short circuit in the driver's side power window switch could cause overheating, melting, or even a fire.
    *   Solution: Dealers were instructed to inspect and replace the power window switch module on affected vehicles.
    *   Recalls: 12V-140

**Summary**

The 2009 Pontiac Torrent presents some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine oil consumption (particularly in the 2.4L), transmission problems (mostly with the 5-speed automatic), and electrical issues like power window and door lock failures are among the most frequently reported. Suspension component wear and interior cosmetic flaws like dashboard cracking are also common. The cost to address these issues can range from relatively minor repairs to more substantial engine or transmission work, potentially influencing the overall cost of ownership. The recall on the power window switch is a critical safety concern that should be verified as completed.
