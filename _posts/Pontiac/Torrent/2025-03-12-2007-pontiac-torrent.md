The 2007 Pontiac Torrent is a mid-size SUV that offers a comfortable ride and decent cargo space. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 169 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.4L V6 producing 185 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Torrent's spacious interior and smooth ride, but common complaints include uninspiring fuel economy and some reliability issues.
