The 1994 Pontiac Sunbird was a compact car available as a coupe and sedan. It offered two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 and a 2.3L inline-4, both paired with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission. The Sunbird received praise for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and handling, but criticism for its lack of power and unimpressive interior.
