The 2002 Pontiac Firebird, the last year of production, is a rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its powerful engines and aggressive styling. Engine options included the 3.8L V6, the 5.7L LS1 V8 (in the Formula and Trans Am trims). The LS1 produced around 310-325 horsepower and 340-350 lb-ft of torque, depending on the model year and exhaust configuration. The available transmissions were a 4-speed automatic (4L60E) and a 6-speed manual (T56). Many people appreciate the Firebird for its performance and affordability, but common complaints include build quality issues, interior materials, and age-related reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**5.7L LS1 V8**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some LS1 engines, particularly those with higher mileage, are prone to consuming oil. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust, a low oil level warning, or the need to add oil frequently.
    * Solution: The solution varies based on the severity. It can range from using a thicker oil to replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or even a complete engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (thicker oil) - $3000+ (engine rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall, misfire, or fail to start. A check engine light will often illuminate with a code related to the crankshaft position sensor.
    * Solution: Replacement of the crankshaft position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2002 Pontiac Firebird can be a fun and engaging sports car, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that arise, especially given the vehicle's age. Engine issues, like oil consumption in the LS1 and intake manifold leaks in the 3.8L, can be moderate to expensive to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4L60E automatic, can be costly as well. Suspension and electrical issues are also common, contributing to the overall cost of ownership. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite significant, making it crucial to inspect any potential purchase thoroughly and factor in potential repair costs.
