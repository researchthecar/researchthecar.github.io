The 2001 Pontiac Firebird, a sleek and sporty muscle car, offered a blend of performance and style that appealed to enthusiasts. Engine options included a standard 3.8L V6 and the more potent 5.7L LS1 V8, both paired with either a manual or automatic transmission. The LS1 produced 310 horsepower and 340 lb-ft of torque in base form. Owners generally loved the Firebird's aggressive styling, powerful engine options (particularly the LS1), and handling. However, common complaints revolved around interior build quality, some reliability issues, and the car's age contributing to wear and tear.
