### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Pontiac Firebird, across its V6 and V8 engine options and manual/automatic transmissions, demonstrates a generally solid reliability record. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the automatic transmission's torque converter clutch and solenoid packs, and potential coolant leaks from intake manifold gaskets on the V6. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and instrument cluster can also occur. Exterior T-top seals are a known point of potential leakage. While these issues are documented, they are often repairable and do not indicate a fundamentally flawed design. Proactive maintenance and addressing early symptoms can significantly mitigate these potential reliability concerns.
