### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Pontiac Firebird, particularly with its V8 engines, offers a compelling performance package. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and oil cooler line failures, which are not uncommon for vehicles of this age and design. Automatic transmission issues, especially with the torque converter, can be a significant repair. Manual transmissions are generally more robust but clutch wear is a consideration. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear out, leading to handling and noise issues. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM, can manifest in various ways. Exterior paint, especially clear coat, may show signs of age. Interior components like the dashboard can crack. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, the Firebird requires diligent maintenance and awareness of these common problem areas to remain a reliable and enjoyable sports car.
