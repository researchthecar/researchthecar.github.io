The 2000 Pontiac Firebird is a sporty rear-wheel-drive car that was available as a coupe or convertible. Engine options included a 3.8L V6, and two different versions of the 5.7L LS1 V8. The LS1 came in the Firebird Formula and Trans Am trims. The base 3.8L V6 produced 200 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque. The LS1 engines were more powerful, with the standard version producing 305 hp and 335 lb-ft of torque. A performance exhaust option brought this up to 320 HP. People loved the Firebird for its aggressive styling, powerful engine options (especially the LS1), and relatively affordable price point. Common dislikes include the sometimes-questionable build quality, interior materials, and dated design.

**Summary**

The 2000 Pontiac Firebird, while a desirable sports car, has some common issues. Engine issues like oil consumption and intake manifold gasket failure can be relatively expensive to address. Transmission problems with the 4L60E are also a common concern. Suspension wear and electrical gremlins are typical of older vehicles. Interior issues such as dashboard cracks and sagging headliners detract from the overall ownership experience. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of them when considering a purchase.
