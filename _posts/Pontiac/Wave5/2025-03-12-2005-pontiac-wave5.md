    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250

*   **Failed Catalytic Converter**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A decrease in fuel economy and engine performance can come with a rattling sound from underneath the car.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**
* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable jerking or hesitation during gear changes, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body or solenoids may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (fluid flush), $400 - $1000+ (valve body/solenoid replacement)
