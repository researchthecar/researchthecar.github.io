**Engine**

**1.6L DOHC 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning light illumination and potentially engine knocking if oil levels are critically low.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and adding oil as needed is a temporary fix. A more permanent solution might involve replacing valve stem seals or piston rings, depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light Due to EVAP System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and a diagnostic scan reveals codes related to the evaporative emission control system (EVAP). Common symptoms include a loose or faulty gas cap.
    *   Solution: Replacing the gas cap is the first step. If the issue persists, further diagnosis of the EVAP system components (purge valve, vent valve, charcoal canister) is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+ depending on the faulty component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting between gears, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. Rough or jerky shifts may also be experienced.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can sometimes alleviate minor shifting issues. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement, or even a complete transmission rebuild, may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2,500+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and poor handling. Visible signs of leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle, including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits noticeably lower on one side, clunking noises coming from the suspension, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken coil spring. Replacing both coil springs on the same axle is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per axle, including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more power windows stop working, either refusing to go up or down.
    *   Solution: Check the power window switch first. If the switch is working, the window motor may be faulty and need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $250+ per window, depending on the issue and part needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headlight/Taillight Bulb Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent burnout of headlight or taillight bulbs.
    *   Solution: Replace the burnt-out bulb. Check the electrical connections and wiring for corrosion or damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $50+ per bulb/socket.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting on Rear Quarter Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust development around the wheel wells on the rear quarter panels.
    *   Solution: Sanding down the rust, applying rust inhibitor, and repainting the affected area. In severe cases, panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per panel, depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
