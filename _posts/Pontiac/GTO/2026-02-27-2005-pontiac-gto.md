### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Pontiac GTO, while a capable performance car, exhibits some common issues primarily related to its powertrain and electrical systems. The V8 engines, particularly the LS1 and LS2, can experience oil cooler line leaks and intake manifold gasket issues. Transmission reliability is generally good, though automatic transmissions may face torque converter problems, and manual transmissions can develop shifter bushing wear. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or instrument cluster, are also a notable concern. While suspension and exterior components are typically robust, owners should be aware of these potential mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to reported symptoms are key to maintaining the GTO's performance and longevity.
