**Introduction:**

The 2005 Pontiac GTO was a muscle car that was revived by Pontiac after a 15-year hiatus. It was offered with a single engine and transmission option: a 6.0-liter LS2 V8 engine paired with a 6-speed Tremec T56 manual transmission. The LS2 V8 produced 400 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. The GTO was known for its powerful engine, handling capabilities, and aggressive styling. Despite its popularity, the GTO had several issues that have been reported by owners.

**Engine:**

**6.0-liter LS2 V8**

* **Piston slap:** Occurs when the pistons make contact with the cylinder walls, causing a knocking noise. Solution: Rebuild the engine with new pistons and cylinders. **Cost to Fix:** $2,500 - $4,000+
* **Oil consumption:** Some engines consume an excessive amount of oil. Solution: Repair or replace the piston rings and/or valve seals. **Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+

**Transmission:**

**6-speed Tremec T56**

* **Bearing failure:** The transmission bearings can fail, causing a grinding noise. Solution: Repair the transmission with new bearings. **Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Synchronizer problems:** The transmission synchronizers can wear out, making it difficult to shift gears. Solution: Rebuild the transmission with new synchronizers. **Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $2,500+
