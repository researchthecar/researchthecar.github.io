The 2004 Pontiac GTO marked the return of the iconic nameplate to the American market after a 30-year absence. This modern GTO, based on the Australian Holden Monaro, came with a powerful 5.7L LS1 V8 engine producing 350 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. All GTOs came standard with a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission, with the option of a 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission. While appreciated for its performance and relative affordability, some owners have reported issues with certain components of the vehicle. Some common criticisms include the somewhat bland exterior styling and interior compared to its muscular performance capabilities.
