The 2005 Pontiac GTO is a rear-wheel-drive coupe that was reintroduced to the US market after being absent for several decades. It came with two engine options: a 5.7L LS1 V8 in early production models and a 6.0L LS2 V8 later in the model year. The LS2 produced 400 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the GTO for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and understated styling. Common complaints include the fuel economy, bland interior styling and some reliability issues.

**Engine**

**6.0L LS2 V8**

*   **Lifter Failure (Collapsing Lifters)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially at idle. Can lead to reduced performance and potential engine damage.

**Summary**

The 2005 Pontiac GTO, while a performance bargain, does have its share of common problems. Engine issues, particularly lifter failure in the LS2 and piston slap in the LS1, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the T56 manual, are also a concern. Other issues like suspension component failures and electrical glitches can add to the ownership cost. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly for repairs and maintenance. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs varying widely depending on the specific problem and the chosen solution. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
