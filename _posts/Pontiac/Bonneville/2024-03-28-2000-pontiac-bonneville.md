**Introduction:**

The 2000 Pontiac Bonneville is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options. It was available with three engine options: a 3.8L V6, a 3.8L supercharged V6, and a 4.6L V8. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic for the 3.8L V6 and a 5-speed automatic for the 3.8L supercharged V6 and 4.6L V8.

Despite its overall popularity, the Bonneville has several common issues reported by owners.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**
- **Intake manifold gasket failure:** This issue can cause coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include a drop in coolant level, an increase in oil consumption, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
- **Power steering pump failure:** This issue can result in heavy steering and whining noises. It is caused by a faulty power steering pump. The fix involves replacing the power steering pump. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600+
- **Alternator failure:** This issue leads to a loss of electrical power and can cause the vehicle to stall. Replacing the alternator is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+

**3.8L Supercharged V6**
- **Supercharger failure:** This severe issue can lead to a complete loss of power. The supercharger may seize up or have internal damage. It requires a complete supercharger replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
- **Fuel injector failure:** This issue can cause rough idling, hesitation, and decreased fuel efficiency. Replacing the faulty fuel injectors is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600+
- **Water pump failure:** This problem can result in overheating and coolant leaks. Fixing it involves replacing the water pump. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+

**4.6L V8**
- **Oil pan gasket leak:** This issue can cause oil leaks and a burning smell. The fix is to replace the oil pan gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
- **Exhaust manifold gasket leak:** This problem can lead to exhaust fumes entering the passenger compartment. The exhaust manifold gasket needs to be replaced to fix it. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
- **Ignition coil failure:** This issue can cause a loss of power and misfiring. Replacing the faulty ignition coil is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
- **Transmission slipping:** This issue is characterized by trouble shifting gears or a lack of acceleration. It can be fixed by rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+

**5-Speed Automatic**
- **Torque converter failure:** This issue can cause shuddering, slippage, or complete transmission failure. It requires a torque converter replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+

**Suspension**

- **Strut mount failure:** This issue can cause noise and vibration during driving. Replacing the worn-out strut mounts is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
- **Sway bar link failure:** This issue can result in clunking sounds and instability during cornering. It involves replacing the failed sway bar links. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

**Electrical**

- **Dashboard cracks:** This issue is a common cosmetic problem where the dashboard develops cracks due to exposure to heat and sunlight. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Summary:**

The 2000 Pontiac Bonneville faces a range of issues varying in severity and cost. The supercharger failure on the 3.8L supercharged V6 engine is a particularly expensive problem, while other issues, such as strut mount failure or trunk latch failure, are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix. Overall, the Bonneville's reliability is average, with some serious issues to be aware of and potential high repair costs.
