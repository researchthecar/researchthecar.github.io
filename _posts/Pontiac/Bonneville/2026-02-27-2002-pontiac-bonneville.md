### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Pontiac Bonneville is a capable full-size sedan with a generally decent reliability record for its age. The most common significant issues tend to be related to the engine, particularly head gasket failures and intake manifold leaks on the 3.8L V6 engines, and transmission problems like torque converter clutch issues. Electrical gremlins, especially those stemming from the Body Control Module, can also be a concern. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates. While not immune to problems, addressing these potential weak points can help maintain the Bonneville's comfort and utility for years to come.
