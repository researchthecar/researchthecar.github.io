The 2001 Pontiac Bonneville was a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Engine options included a 3.8L V6 producing 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, and a supercharged 3.8L V6 generating 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T65E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically appreciated the car's smooth highway cruising and ample passenger space, but common complaints included electrical issues and the car's tendency for certain components to wear out over time.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6 (L36)**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**

**Summary**

The 2001 Pontiac Bonneville, while offering a comfortable ride, is prone to several common issues due to its age. Engine problems like intake manifold gasket failures and supercharger issues (for the L67) can be moderately expensive to fix. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4T65E, can range from minor solenoid replacements to costly torque converter replacements or complete transmission overhauls. Suspension issues and electrical glitches also contribute to the overall cost of ownership. While individual issues may not be excessively expensive, the cumulative effect of these repairs can make maintaining this vehicle costly over the long term.
