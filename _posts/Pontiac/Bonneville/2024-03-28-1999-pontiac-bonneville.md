**1999 Pontiac Bonneville**

The 1999 Pontiac Bonneville is a full-size sedan that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 3.8-liter V6 that produced 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 3.8-liter supercharged V6 that produced 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque.
