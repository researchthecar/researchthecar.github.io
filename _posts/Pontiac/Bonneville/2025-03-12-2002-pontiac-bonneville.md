The 2002 Pontiac Bonneville was a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Engine options included a 3.8L V6 (L36 and L67 supercharged). The L36 produced around 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. People generally liked the Bonneville for its smooth ride and ample power from the V6, but some disliked its somewhat dated styling and occasional electrical gremlins.

**Summary**

The 2002 Pontiac Bonneville, while a comfortable car, does have its share of common problems. Engine issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks (especially in the L36) and supercharger problems (in the L67) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the 4T65-E are also prevalent. Electrical problems, particularly with the BCM, can be difficult to diagnose and fix. Suspension issues, particularly with the optional air ride system, can also add to the ownership cost. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering this vehicle. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few dollars for a simple fix to several hundred or even thousands for more extensive work.
