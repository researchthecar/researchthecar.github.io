**Introduction:**

The 2004 Pontiac Bonneville is a full-size sedan that comes equipped with a 3.8L V6 engine producing 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.8L supercharged V6 producing 260 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Bonneville is known for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and powerful engines. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of handling prowess and subpar fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

**3.8L Supercharged V6**

* **Supercharger Failure:** Failed supercharger bearings or internal damage can lead to loss of boost pressure and engine performance. Replacement of the supercharger assembly is necessary. Estimated Cost: $2,000 - $3,000+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Solenoid Failure:** Malfunctioning solenoids can cause shifting issues, slipping, and increased transmission temperatures. Replacement of the affected solenoids is required. Estimated Cost: $250 - $500+

* **Transmission Slippage:** Worn clutch plates or torque converter issues can result in loss of power and difficulty changing gears. Transmission rebuild or replacement is often necessary. Estimated Cost: $1,500 - $3,000+
