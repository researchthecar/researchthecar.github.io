**Summary**

The 2003 Pontiac Bonneville, while comfortable and well-equipped, does have its share of common issues. Engine issues are relatively common, particularly with the intake manifold gasket on the L36 and the supercharger coupler on the L67. Transmission problems, mainly with the 4T65-E, can be costly. Suspension issues, especially with the rear air ride system, also add to the potential ownership costs. Electrical gremlins, such as headlight switch and window regulator failures, are also observed. Overall, while the Bonneville can be a good value, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing over $1000.
