**Summary**

The 2004 Pontiac Bonneville, while praised for its comfort and power, has several common issues. Engine-related problems, such as intake manifold leaks and supercharger failures (on the GXP), can be moderately expensive to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter, are also common and can be costly. Electrical problems, especially window motor and BCM failures, are also frequent complaints. Suspension issues, mostly related to the rear air suspension on the GXP trim, can add to the overall maintenance costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the specific problem.
