The 2005 Pontiac Vibe is a compact hatchback/wagon known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and Toyota-derived reliability. The Vibe shares its platform and many components with the Toyota Matrix. The base engine is a 1.8L inline-4 producing 130 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. The Vibe was liked for its spacious interior, good gas mileage, and affordable price. Some dislikes included its somewhat bland styling (for some), road noise, and relatively uninspired handling.
