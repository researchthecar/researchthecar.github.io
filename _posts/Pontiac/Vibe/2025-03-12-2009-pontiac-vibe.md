The 2009 Pontiac Vibe is a compact hatchback known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and reliability. It's essentially a rebadged Toyota Matrix, sharing the same platform and mechanical components. The Vibe was available with two engine options: a 1.8L inline-4 producing 132 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. The 1.8L engine could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.4L engine came with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. People often liked the Vibe for its spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and Toyota-sourced reliability. Common dislikes included the somewhat bland styling and the less-than-thrilling performance, especially with the base engine.
