The 2006 Pontiac Vibe is a compact hatchback/wagon that was popular for its versatility, fuel efficiency, and Toyota-derived reliability. It was essentially a rebadged Toyota Matrix, offering a practical alternative in the Pontiac lineup. Available engines included a 1.8L inline-4, producing either 123 hp and 122 lb-ft of torque, or 130 hp and 125 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific model. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally liked the Vibe's spacious cargo area, good gas mileage, and reliable Toyota mechanicals. Common complaints often revolved around the somewhat bland interior, road noise, and the Pontiac-specific styling elements, which were considered less appealing than the Toyota Matrix.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline-4 (1ZZ-FE)**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some 2006 Pontiac Vibes with the 1.8L engine experienced excessive oil consumption, leading to the need to add oil frequently between oil changes. This issue often becomes more prevalent as the vehicle ages and the mileage increases. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be noticeable.
    * Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can resolve the issue. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+

* **Failed Mass Airflow Sensor**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Mass Airflow (MAF) sensor can fail, causing the engine to run poorly, stall, or hesitate during acceleration. The check engine light will likely illuminate.
    * Solution: Replace the MAF sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported delayed or harsh shifting, especially between gears. This can be caused by worn solenoids, low transmission fluid, or valve body issues within the transmission.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may improve the shifting. If the problem persists, solenoid replacement or valve body repair/replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out over time, resulting in a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

* **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise from the rear of the vehicle that increases with speed.
    * Solution: Replacement of the wheel bearing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Electrical**

* **Dim Headlights**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained about headlights that are not very bright, particularly at night.
    * Solution: Replacing the headlight bulbs with higher-quality or LED bulbs may improve visibility. Checking the headlight wiring and grounds is also recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+

* **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    * Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuators can fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking properly with the key fob or interior switch.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Rear Wheel Wells**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the rear wheel wells.
    * Solution: Sand, repair, and repaint rusted area.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the severity of the rust

**Interior**

* **Center Console Lid Hinge Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The hinge on the center console lid can break, causing the lid to become loose or detach.
    * Solution: Replace the center console lid or repair the hinge (if possible).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

**Summary**

The 2006 Pontiac Vibe is a generally reliable vehicle thanks to its Toyota underpinnings. However, like any car of its age, it's susceptible to wear and tear. The most significant potential issues are related to excessive oil consumption in the 1.8L engine and possible transmission problems with the 4-speed automatic. Suspension components also wear out over time. Electrical and interior issues are typically less severe and costly to repair. Potential buyers should pay close attention to the engine's oil consumption and the transmission's shifting behavior during a test drive. Checking for rust, especially around the rear wheel wells, is also recommended.
