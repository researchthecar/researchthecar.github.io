**Introduction:**

The 2009 Pontiac Vibe is a compact crossover SUV that was available with two engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder and a 2.4L 4-cylinder. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Vibe was known for its spacious interior, versatility, and affordability. However, it was criticized for its lack of power, particularly with the 1.8L engine.

**Summary:**

While the 2009 Pontiac Vibe was generally a reliable vehicle, it faced several common issues. The 1.8L engine experienced significant oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failures, while the 5-speed manual transmission suffered from synchronizer wear. The automatic transmission could develop torque converter shudder. Other issues included alternator failure, sunroof leaks, dashboard cracking, and seat fabric tearing. The severity of these issues ranged from minor annoyances to potential engine damage, with repair costs varying from a few hundred dollars to over four thousand dollars. Therefore, it is important to research the specific issues associated with the Vibe before purchasing a used model.
