The 2007 Pontiac Vibe is a compact hatchback/wagon that was co-developed with Toyota and is mechanically very similar to the Toyota Matrix. It offered a practical and fuel-efficient option for buyers. Available engines included a 1.8L inline-4 producing 126 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate its reliability and fuel economy, while others dislike its somewhat bland styling and basic interior features.
