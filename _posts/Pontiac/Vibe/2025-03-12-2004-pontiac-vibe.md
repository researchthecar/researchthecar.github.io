The 2004 Pontiac Vibe is a compact wagon known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and Toyota-sourced reliability. Engine options include the 1.8L 4-cylinder 1ZZ-FE engine producing 130 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque (or 123hp/115 lb-ft for CA models) and the 1.8L 2ZZ-GE engine producing 164 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic (available with the 1ZZ-FE), and a 6-speed manual (available with the 2ZZ-GE on the GT trim). Owners often appreciate the Vibe's spacious interior, good gas mileage, and Toyota Corolla-based mechanicals. Common complaints revolve around the car's somewhat bland styling, road noise, and potential for rust in certain climates.

**Engine**

**1.8L 1ZZ-FE**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil, low oil level, blue smoke from the exhaust, especially at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings is the recommended solution; however, due to the vehicle's age, engine replacement may be more cost-effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VVT-i Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak around the VVT-i actuator, visible oil on the engine block, oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VVT-i oil control valve or the VVT-i actuator gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.8L 2ZZ-GE**

*   **Oil Consumption During High RPM Operation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Significant oil consumption during sustained high-RPM driving, common in the GT model.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and topping off as needed. Some owners explore aftermarket oil catch cans. Rebuilding the engine with updated piston rings is a more permanent but costly solution.

**Summary**

The 2004 Pontiac Vibe, while generally reliable thanks to its Toyota underpinnings, does suffer from some common issues related to its age. Engine oil consumption is a primary concern, especially on higher mileage vehicles. Transmission issues, while not universal, can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components and electrical gremlins are also common. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (instrument cluster lights) to potentially major (engine rebuild or transmission replacement). Addressing these issues proactively can help maintain the Vibe's reliability and extend its lifespan.
