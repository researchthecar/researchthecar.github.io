### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Pontiac Vibe is generally a reliable vehicle, particularly those equipped with the Toyota-sourced 1.8L engine. Common issues tend to be related to age and mileage, such as oil consumption in both engine variants and potential wear on suspension components like struts and sway bar links. Automatic transmission issues, while not universal, can manifest as harsh shifting. Electrical problems, particularly with the Body Control Module, can be more complex and costly to diagnose and repair. Overall, proactive maintenance, especially monitoring oil levels, and addressing suspension and electrical gremlins promptly can ensure continued dependable service from the Vibe.
