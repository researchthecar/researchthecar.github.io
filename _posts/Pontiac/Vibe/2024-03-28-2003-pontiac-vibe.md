**Introduction**

The 2003 Pontiac Vibe is a compact SUV jointly developed by General Motors and Toyota. It was offered with three engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder, a 2.4L 4-cylinder, and a 3.0L V6. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

The Vibe received praise for its spacious interior, versatile cargo area, and impressive fuel economy. However, it was also criticized for its lackluster performance, particularly with the 1.8L engine.
