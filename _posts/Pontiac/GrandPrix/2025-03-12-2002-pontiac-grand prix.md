The 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix was a popular mid-size sedan known for its sporty styling and available supercharged V6 engine. Engine options included a 3.1L V6 (175 hp, 195 lb-ft torque), a 3.8L V6 (200 hp, 225 lb-ft torque), and a supercharged 3.8L V6 (240 hp, 280 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 4T65-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Grand Prix's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and powerful supercharged engine. Common dislikes included the car's somewhat dated styling, plastic interior trim, and occasional reliability issues.
