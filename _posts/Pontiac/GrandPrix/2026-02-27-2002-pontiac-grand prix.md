### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix, while offering a comfortable ride and decent performance, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and platform. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the engine's intake manifold gaskets and EGR valve, particularly on the V6 models. Transmission problems, specifically with the 4T65E, such as torque converter shudder and solenoid failures, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, including BCM malfunctions and alternator failures, can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints may require attention. Exterior rust and interior climate control/power window issues are also areas to inspect. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and budget accordingly for maintenance and potential repairs to keep this vehicle running smoothly.
