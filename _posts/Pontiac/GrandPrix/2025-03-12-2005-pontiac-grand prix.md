The 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix was offered in several trims: base, GT, GTP, and GXP. Engine options included a 3.8L V6 (200 hp, 225 lb-ft torque) in the base and GT models, a supercharged 3.8L V6 (260 hp, 280 lb-ft torque) in the GTP model, and a 5.3L V8 (303 hp, 323 lb-ft torque) in the GXP model. All models were equipped with a 4-speed automatic transmission, though the specific transmission model varied depending on the engine. Owners often praised the Grand Prix for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and powerful engine options, especially in the GTP and GXP trims. Common complaints include issues with the electrical system, particularly the instrument cluster, and general reliability concerns as the vehicles aged.

**Summary**
The 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix has several common issues, with electrical problems and engine-related issues being the most prevalent. Intake manifold gasket failures, coolant elbow leaks, and instrument cluster malfunctions are frequently reported. The 5.3L V8 in the GXP model is particularly prone to AFM lifter failures, which can be costly to repair. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission or engine work, can be quite expensive. The overall severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, so potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchasing.
