The 2003 Pontiac Grand Prix can be a reliable car, but it is important to be aware of common issues, especially considering its age. Engine issues, such as intake manifold gasket failures, are relatively common and can lead to more serious problems if not addressed. Transmission issues, while not always present, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins are also a possibility. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs. The cost to fix these issues can vary widely, but potential buyers should factor these expenses into their budget. The 3.8L supercharged version tends to have some additional wear parts that can become issues as the vehicle gets older.
