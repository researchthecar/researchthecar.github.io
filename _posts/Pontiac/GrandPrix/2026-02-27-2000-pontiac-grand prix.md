### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix is a reasonably reliable vehicle, particularly the naturally aspirated V6 engines. The most common issues tend to revolve around the intake manifold gaskets, EGR valve, and the 4T65E transmission's torque converter clutch and solenoids. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM, can also surface. Exterior paint and interior components like HVAC blend doors and power window motors are also areas where owners might encounter problems as the car ages. Regular maintenance and addressing these known issues promptly can significantly extend the life and enjoyment of the vehicle.
