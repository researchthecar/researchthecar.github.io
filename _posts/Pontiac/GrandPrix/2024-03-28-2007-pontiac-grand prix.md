## 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix

The 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix was a midsize sedan offered with three engine options: a 3.8L V6 (200 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque), a 3.8L V6 with variable valve timing (224 hp and 245 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.3L V8 (303 hp and 323 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a four-speed automatic with the 3.8L V6 and a six-speed automatic with the 3.8L V6 with variable valve timing and the 5.3L V8.

The Grand Prix was praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong V8 engine option. However, it was criticized for its poor fuel economy, bland styling, and outdated technology.
