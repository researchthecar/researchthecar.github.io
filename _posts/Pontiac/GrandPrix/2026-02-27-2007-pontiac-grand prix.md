### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix, particularly with the popular 3.8L V6 engines, can be a reliable choice if well-maintained. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the 4T65E transmission, specifically torque converter problems and solenoid failures. Engine-wise, intake manifold gasket leaks are a common concern across both naturally aspirated and supercharged variants. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or premature alternator failure, can also arise. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints may require attention over time. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, addressing these mechanical and electrical points proactively can contribute to a more dependable ownership experience.
