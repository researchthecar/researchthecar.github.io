The 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix was a mid-size sedan known for its blend of performance and practicality. Engine options included a 3.8L V6 (200 hp and 230 lb-ft of torque), a 3.8L Supercharged V6 (260 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.3L V8 (303 hp and 323 lb-ft of torque) on the GXP model. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Grand Prix for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available performance upgrades. Common dislikes included some cheap interior materials and a somewhat dated design.

**Summary**

The 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix has several common issues to be aware of. Engine problems, particularly with the 5.3L V8's AFM system and oil consumption, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially related to the torque converter, are also relatively frequent. Electrical problems with the ignition switch and instrument cluster are also noted. Suspension issues are also common, particularly strut mount and rear air suspension failures. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can be significant. A thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2007 Grand Prix.
