- **Cost:** $150 - $300


### 3.8L V6 Supercharged (3800 Series II)
**Lower Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Similar to naturally aspirated, but can also lead to supercharger oil leaks.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the lower intake manifold gaskets. Often recommended to replace supercharger decoupler and snout seal at the same time.
- **Cost:** $500 - $900

**Supercharger Belt Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of supercharger boost, reduced power, whining noise from engine bay.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the supercharger belt.

## Transmission

### 4T65E Automatic Transmission
**Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering at highway speeds, slipping, delayed engagement, check engine light with TCC codes.
- **Solution:** Rebuilding or replacement of the torque converter and potentially the transmission.
- **Cost:** $1200 - $2500

**Solenoid Pack Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh shifting, delayed shifting, failure to shift into certain gears.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the transmission solenoid pack.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Struts/Shocks**

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix, particularly with the popular 3.8L V6 engines, can be a reliable car if common issues are addressed proactively. The most frequently reported problems revolve around the intake manifold gaskets (especially on earlier 3.8L engines), the 4T65E transmission's torque converter clutch and solenoid pack, and potential electrical gremlins related to the BCM and alternator. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may also require attention as the vehicle ages. While interior electronics like the dashboard display and HVAC actuators can develop faults, these are generally less critical. Overall, the Grand Prix offers decent value, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas.
