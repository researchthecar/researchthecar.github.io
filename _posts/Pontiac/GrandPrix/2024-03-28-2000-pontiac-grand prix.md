**Introduction:**

The 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It comes equipped with a 3.8L V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. The Grand Prix is available with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission.

People like the Grand Prix for its sporty handling, comfortable seats, and affordable price. However, some complaints include a lack of power from the V6 engine, poor fuel economy, and a cramped back seat.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Oil or coolant leaks from the intake manifold gaskets. This can cause engine overheating, reduced power, and increased emissions. The gaskets and bolts need to be replaced. $400 - $600+
* **Knock sensor failure:** The knock sensor monitors the engine for detonation and adjusts the timing accordingly. A faulty knock sensor can cause pinging or knocking noises from the engine, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. The knock sensor needs to be replaced. $200 - $300+
* **EGR valve failure:** The EGR valve recirculates exhaust gases back into the intake manifold to reduce emissions. A faulty EGR valve can cause increased emissions, reduced power, and engine overheating. The EGR valve needs to be cleaned or replaced. $100 - $250+

**Transmission**

**4-speed automatic transmission**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip or hesitate when shifting gears. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, a faulty torque converter, or a lack of transmission fluid. The transmission needs to be rebuilt or replaced. $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Transmission fluid leaks:** Transmission fluid may leak from the pan gasket, seals, or lines. This can cause the transmission to overheat and fail. The leaks need to be repaired and the transmission fluid needs to be replaced. $200 - $500+

**5-speed manual transmission**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch may slip or chatter when engaging gears. This can be caused by a worn clutch disc, pressure plate, or throw-out bearing. The clutch needs to be replaced. $500 - $800+
* **Transmission fluid leaks:** Transmission fluid may leak from the seals or lines. This can cause the transmission to overheat and fail. The leaks need to be repaired and the transmission fluid needs to be replaced. $200 - $500+

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** The struts may wear out and cause the vehicle to ride rough and handle poorly. The struts need to be replaced. $600 - $800+
* **Rear suspension clunking noise:** A clunking noise may be heard from the rear suspension when driving over bumps. This can be caused by worn control arm bushings or sway bar links. The bushings or links need to be replaced. $200 - $400+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery may drain quickly, even when the vehicle is turned off. This can be caused by a faulty alternator, starter, or parasitic drain. The faulty component needs to be repaired or replaced. $200 - $600+
* **Headlight failure:** The headlights may fail to turn on or may flicker. This can be caused by a faulty headlight switch, relay, or wiring. The faulty component needs to be repaired or replaced. $100 - $300+
* **Ignition switch failure:** The ignition switch may fail to start the vehicle or may cause the vehicle to stall. The ignition switch needs to be replaced. $200 - $400+

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The body panels may rust, especially in areas where road salt is used. The rust needs to be repaired or the body panels need to be replaced. $500 - $2,000+
* **Door handles:** The door handles may break or become loose. The door handles need to be replaced. $200 - $400+
* **Trunk latch failure:** The trunk latch may fail to open or close properly. The latch needs to be repaired or replaced. $100 - $200+

**Interior**

* **Seat recliner failure:** The seat recliners may fail to work properly or may become loose. The recliners need to be repaired or replaced. $200 - $400+
* **Power window failure:** The power windows may fail to operate or may become stuck. The window motors or switches need to be replaced. $200 - $400+
* **Dashboard cracking:** The dashboard may crack or become faded. The dashboard needs to be replaced. $500 - $1,000+

**Summary:**

The 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix is a reliable vehicle but has some common issues to watch out for. The most serious issues are related to the engine (intake manifold gasket failure) and transmission (slipping or hesitation). These issues can be costly to repair. However, many of the other issues are relatively minor and can be fixed for a reasonable price.
