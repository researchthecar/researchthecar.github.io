The 2009 Pontiac Matiz, also known as the Chevrolet Spark in some markets, is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city driving. In the US market, it was only available with a 0.8L Inline 3 cylinder engine producing around 51 horsepower and 53 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Matiz's affordability and small size, which makes parking in tight spaces easier. However, they often dislike its limited power and basic features.
