The 2010 Pontiac Matiz, also known as the Chevrolet Spark in many markets, was a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It was typically powered by a 0.8L Inline 3-cylinder engine producing around 51 horsepower and approximately 52 lb-ft of torque. It came equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciated its small size, making it easy to maneuver and park in urban environments. However, its small engine and basic features were sometimes criticized for lack of power and limited comfort. Note that due to the rarity of the Pontiac Matiz in some markets, specific issue data may be limited. It's important to verify common issues in your specific region.
