### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Pontiac Matiz is a basic city car with a reliability profile that aligns with its budget-friendly nature. Common issues tend to be concentrated in areas like oil and coolant leaks from the engine, clutch wear on manual transmissions, and potential actuator problems with the automated manual.
