### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Pontiac G8 is a capable performance sedan with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The most notable reliability concern revolves around the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in the V8 engines, which can lead to lifter issues if not maintained or addressed. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter shudder in the automatic, are also reported but often manageable with fluid services. Suspension components like strut mounts can wear over time, leading to noise. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system, are not uncommon. Overall, the G8 offers a rewarding driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific potential repair areas, especially the AFM system, and factor them into ownership costs.
