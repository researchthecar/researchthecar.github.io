### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Pontiac G8 is a capable performance sedan with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly the V8 models. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as timing chain and oil leak problems on the V6, and Active Fuel Management (AFM) related lifter issues on the V8. Transmission issues, while not universal, can occur, especially with the automatic. Electrical components like window regulators and infotainment systems can also present minor annoyances. Suspension wear, particularly ball joints and bushings, is also a possibility on higher mileage examples. Despite these potential drawbacks, many G8s remain reliable vehicles with proper maintenance and addressing these known issues.
