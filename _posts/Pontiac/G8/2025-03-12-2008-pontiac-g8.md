The 2008 Pontiac G8 was a rear-wheel-drive sedan known for its performance and Australian-engineered chassis. It was available with three engine options: a 3.6L V6 producing 256 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque, a 5.3L V8 producing 302 hp and 320 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.0L V8 producing 361 hp and 385 lb-ft of torque. The V6 was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V8s came with a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the G8's blend of power, handling, and value. Common complaints centered around some reliability issues and the car's relatively short production run, which made parts availability a potential concern over time.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may experience a rattling noise, especially on startup. The check engine light may illuminate with codes related to timing chain issues. Can lead to poor performance and potential engine damage.

**Summary**

The 2008 Pontiac G8 has some common issues, primarily related to the engine and electrical systems. The AFM lifter failure on the 5.3L and oil consumption on the 6.0L can be expensive to fix. Electrical issues like DIC failure and door lock actuators are also relatively common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing a 2008 Pontiac G8.
