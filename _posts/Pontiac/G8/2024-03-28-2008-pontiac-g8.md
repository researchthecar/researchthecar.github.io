## 2008 Pontiac G8

The 2008 Pontiac G8 was a high-performance sedan offered with a choice of two V8 engines. The base engine was a 3.6-liter V6 with 252 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 6.0-liter V8 with 361 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a standard six-speed automatic transmission.
