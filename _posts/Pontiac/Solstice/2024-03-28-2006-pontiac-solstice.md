**The 2006 Pontiac Solstice: A Sports Car with Ups and Downs**

The 2006 Pontiac Solstice is a two-seater roadster that debuted as a concept car in 2004. It was praised for its sleek design, handling, and affordability. The Solstice was available with a choice of two engines: a 2.4-liter Ecotec four-cylinder engine producing 177 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged Ecotec four-cylinder engine producing 260 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission.

Despite its initial popularity, the Solstice faced several issues that plagued its reliability and reputation.

**Engine**

Symptoms include rattling noises from the engine, loss of power, and engine stalling. Solution involves replacing the timing chain and related components. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Oil Consumption:** Excessive oil consumption can occur due to worn piston rings or valve seals. Symptoms include a burning oil smell, low oil levels, and engine knocking. Solution involves replacing the piston rings or valve seals. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+

**2.0-liter Turbo Ecotec**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail prematurely due to oil starvation or other mechanical issues. Symptoms include loss of boost pressure, reduced engine performance, and increased exhaust smoke. Solution involves replacing the turbocharger. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

**Five-Speed Manual**

* **Synchros Wear:** The synchronizers can wear out prematurely, causing difficulty shifting gears. Symptoms include grinding noises when shifting, difficulty engaging certain gears, and popping out of gear. Solution involves replacing the synchros or the entire transmission. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+

**Four-Speed Automatic**

* **Valve Body Failure:** The valve body can malfunction due to electrical or mechanical issues. Symptoms include harsh or delayed shifting, slipping gears, and erratic transmission behavior. Solution involves replacing the valve body or the entire transmission. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,500+
