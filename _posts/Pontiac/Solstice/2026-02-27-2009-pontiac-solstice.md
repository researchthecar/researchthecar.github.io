### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Pontiac Solstice presents a mixed reliability profile. While its sporty nature is appealing, potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly concerning the engine (oil leaks, timing chain on the 2.4L, turbo and PCV on the 2.0L turbo), transmission (clutch wear, shifter linkage, automatic leaks), and electrical systems (BCM, alternator). Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can also wear. The convertible top mechanism and interior climate control actuators are other areas to monitor. Despite these potential issues, many problems are repairable, and diligent maintenance can mitigate some risks. It's advisable to have any pre-owned Solstice thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic.
