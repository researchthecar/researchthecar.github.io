### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Pontiac Solstice presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the turbocharged variant, can be prone to issues like turbocharger failure and fuel system problems, while the naturally aspirated engine may suffer from oil leaks and timing chain concerns. Transmission reliability varies, with manual clutches wearing out and automatics sometimes exhibiting harsh shifting. Suspension components, especially bushings, can require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and headlight switches, are also noted. The convertible top mechanism is another area that may require maintenance. While not plagued by universal failures, potential buyers should be aware of these specific points of concern and factor in potential repair costs.
