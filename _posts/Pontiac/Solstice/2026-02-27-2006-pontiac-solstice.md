# 2006 Pontiac Solstice

### Overview
The 2006 Pontiac Solstice, a sporty two-seater convertible, aimed to capture the affordable performance market. While its striking design and rear-wheel-drive platform were appealing, its first model year saw some teething issues common to new vehicle introductions. Reliability data for the 2006 model year indicates that while the core mechanicals are generally sound, certain components experienced more frequent problems than others. Owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly concerning the powertrain and some electrical systems, though many of these were addressed in later model years or through recalls. Overall, the 2006 Solstice offers a fun driving experience, but potential buyers should consider its early production status.
