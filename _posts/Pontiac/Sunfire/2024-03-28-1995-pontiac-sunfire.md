**Introduction:**

The 1995 Pontiac Sunfire was a popular compact car known for its sporty styling and affordable price. It was available with two engine options: a 2.2L Ecotec 4-cylinder engine (120 hp, 140 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.3L Quad 4 4-cylinder engine (150 hp, 150 lb-ft of torque). The 2.2L engine was paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.3L engine came exclusively with a 5-speed manual transmission.

Owners praised the Sunfire's stylish looks, reliable engines, and responsive handling. However, some criticized its cramped interior, limited storage space, and lack of certain features compared to competitors.
