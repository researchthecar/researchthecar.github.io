**Introduction:**

The 2002 Pontiac Sunfire is a compact car that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 2.2-liter four-cylinder that produced 140 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. A 2.4-liter four-cylinder was optional, producing 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Sunfire was praised for its affordability, sporty handling, and comfortable interior. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, poor fuel economy, and cheap interior materials.
