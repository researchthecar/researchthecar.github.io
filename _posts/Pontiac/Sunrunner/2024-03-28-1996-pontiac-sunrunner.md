**Introduction**

The 1996 Pontiac Sunrunner is a compact SUV that was offered with two engine options and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.2L inline-4, while the optional engine was a 3.4L V6. Both engines were paired with a standard five-speed manual transmission, while the V6 could also be paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The Sunrunner was available with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.

The Sunrunner was praised for its comfortable interior, spacious cargo area, and good fuel economy. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, especially with the base engine.
