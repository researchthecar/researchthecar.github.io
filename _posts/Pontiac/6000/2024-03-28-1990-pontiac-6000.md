* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Can cause vacuum leaks, resulting in rough idle, stalling, and reduced power. Symptoms include a hissing sound from the engine, decreased fuel efficiency, and engine check light. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $300-$600. Recalls: None found.
* **Water pump failure:** Premature failure can lead to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include coolant leaks, overheating, and a squealing noise from the engine.

Symptoms include a hissing sound from the engine, decreased fuel efficiency, and engine check light. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $300-$600. Recalls: None found.
* **Ignition coil failure:** Can cause misfiring and engine performance issues. Symptoms include a rough idle, reduced power, and engine check light. The solution is to replace the ignition coil. Estimated cost to fix: $100-$300. Recalls: None found.

**Transmission**

**3-speed automatic transmission**
* **Shifting issues:** May experience hard shifting, slipping, or no shifting. Symptoms include delayed or erratic gear changes, slipping gears, or inability to engage gears. The solution can vary depending on the specific issue, but may include replacing the transmission filter and fluid, adjusting the shift linkage, or rebuilding the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $500-$2,000. Recalls: None found.
