**Introduction:**

The 2008 Aston Martin DBS is a high-performance grand tourer powered by a naturally aspirated V12 engine. It boasts impressive specs, with 510 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. Its sleek design and luxurious cabin make it highly appealing to enthusiasts. However, like any vehicle, it has specific issues that owners have reported over time.

**Engine**

**6.0L V12**

- **Oil Leak from Valve Cover Gaskets:** Oil leaks can develop due to failing valve cover gaskets, which sit between the valve covers and cylinder heads. Symptoms include oil stains under the vehicle and reduced engine oil levels. Replacement of the gaskets is the solution, with an estimated cost of $200 - $400.
- **Exhaust Manifold Cracking:** Cracking exhaust manifolds can occur due to excessive heat and stress. Symptoms include a burnt smell, rattling noises, and reduced engine power. Replacement of the cracked manifold is necessary, with an estimated cost of $1,200 - $2,000.
- **Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) Failure:** Faulty TPS can send incorrect signals to the fuel injection system, leading to engine hesitation or stalling. Replacement of the TPS is the solution, with an estimated cost of $250 - $450.
- **Camshaft Sensor Failure:** Similar to TPS failure, a faulty camshaft sensor can provide inaccurate signals, affecting engine timing and performance. Replacement of the sensor is required, with an estimated cost of $300 - $600.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

- **Transmission Grinding:** Rough gear shifts, excessive noise, and difficulty engaging gears can indicate transmission grinding. Causes may include worn or damaged gears or synchros. A transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary, with an estimated cost of $2,000 - $5,000.
- **Clutch Slipping:** A slipping clutch might result in poor acceleration, a burning smell, or jumping gears. Clutch replacement is the solution, with an estimated cost of $1,500 - $2,500.

**Suspension**

- **Faulty Adaptive Dampers:** The adaptive dampers may malfunction, reducing ride quality and handling. Symptoms includebouncy or overly stiff suspension responses. Replacement of the dampers is necessary, with an estimated cost of $1,000 - $2,000.
- **Control Arm Bushings Wear:** Worn control arm bushings can lead to clunking noises, excessive tire wear, and reduced handling precision. Replacement of the bushings is the solution, with an estimated cost of $400 - $600.

**Electrical**

- **Battery Drain:** Premature battery discharge can occur due to parasitic drains from faulty electrical components or a faulty alternator. Testing and replacing the affected parts is the solution, with an estimated cost of $200 - $500.
- **Electrical Harness Issues:** Faulty wiring or electrical harnesses can lead to various electrical malfunctions, such as flickering lights, inoperative features, or engine stalling. Diagnosis and repair of affected harnesses is necessary, with an estimated cost of $500 - $1,500.
- **Radio/Navigation Screen Malfunction:** The infotainment system may experience issues such as screen freezing, unresponsive touchscreens, or distorted audio. Software updates or replacement of the unit may be necessary, with an estimated cost of $500 - $1,000.

**Exterior**

- **Headlight Condensation:** Condensation inside the headlights may occur due to moisture accumulation. Replacement of the affected headlamps is the solution, with an estimated cost of $1,000 - $2,000.
- **Plastic Trim Fading:** Plastic exterior trims may fade or become discolored over time, especially in areas exposed to sunlight. Replacement of the affected trims is the solution, with an estimated cost of $200 - $600.
- **Carbon Fiber Trim Delamination:** Carbon fiber trim pieces may experience delamination or peeling. In the worst cases, the entire trim piece may need to be replaced, with an estimated cost of $2,000 - $4,000.

**Interior**

- **Steering Wheel Buttons Malfunction:** Steering wheel-mounted buttons may become unresponsive or sticky. Replacement of the affected button panels is the solution, with an estimated cost of $100 - $300.
- **Climate Control Panel Failure:** The climate control panel may malfunction, resulting in erratic temperature control or inoperative AC/heating functions. Replacement of the control module is necessary, with an estimated cost of $500 - $1,000.
- **Clock Display Failure:** The clock display on the dashboard may fail, displaying incorrect time or becoming completely blank. Replacement of the clock module is the solution, with an estimated cost of $150 - $300.

**Recalls:**

- NHTSA Campaign Number: 11V180
- Description: Fuel leaks due to faulty fuel lines
- Resolution: Fuel line replacement

- NHTSA Campaign Number: 11V254
- Description: Power steering fluid leaks due to faulty hoses

**Summary:**

The 2008 Aston Martin DBS is a captivating grand tourer with its potent V12 engine and luxurious cabin. However, like any vehicle, it has certain issues to consider. The engine can suffer from oil leaks, exhaust manifold cracking, and sensor failures. The transmission may experience grinding or clutch slippage. Suspension components and electrical systems can also have problems. Some exterior and interior issues, such as trim fading and button malfunctions, have also been reported.

While some issues can be minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be more severe and costly. It is crucial for owners to stay informed about potential problems and to have them addressed promptly to ensure the vehicle's reliability and performance.
