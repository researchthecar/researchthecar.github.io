The 2011 Aston Martin DBS is a grand tourer known for its stunning design, powerful performance, and luxurious interior. It features a naturally aspirated 6.0-liter V12 engine producing 510 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. All models came with a standard rear mid-mounted six-speed manual transmission, with an optional six-speed "Touchtronic 2" automatic transmission. Owners often praise the DBS for its beautiful styling, exhilarating engine note, and engaging driving experience. Criticisms often revolve around the high running costs, occasional electrical gremlins, and limited rear seat space (if equipped).
