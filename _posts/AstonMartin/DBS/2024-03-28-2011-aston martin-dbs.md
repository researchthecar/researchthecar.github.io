**Introduction:**

The 2011 Aston Martin DBS is a high-performance sports car produced by Aston Martin. It features a naturally aspirated 6.0-liter V12 engine generating 510 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. Power is transferred to the rear wheels through a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automated manual transmission. The DBS is known for its sleek design, impressive power, and luxurious interior. However, it is not without its drawbacks.

**Engine**

**6.0L V12**

* **Valve Stem Seal Failure:** Leaking valve stem seals can cause excessive oil consumption, resulting in smoking from the exhaust and reduced engine performance. The solution involves replacing the worn seals. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure:** A faulty camshaft position sensor can disrupt the engine's timing, leading to performance issues, stalling, and potential engine damage. The sensor needs to be replaced. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Synchro Mesh Wear:** Over time, the synchronizers in the transmission can wear out, causing difficulty shifting gears. Repair involves rebuilding the transmission or replacing the affected components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,500 - $5,000+

**6-Speed Automated Manual**

* **Clutch Pack Failure:** The clutch pack in the automated manual transmission can wear out prematurely, leading to slipping and loss of power. The transmission requires disassembly and replacement of the clutch pack. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $4,000 - $6,000+
* **Solenoid Failure:** Electrical solenoids can malfunction, causing shifting problems and potentially leaving the car stuck in a particular gear. Replacing the affected solenoid is the solution. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+
