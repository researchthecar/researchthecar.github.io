The 2022 Aston Martin DBS, while a beautiful and powerful vehicle, can be prone to certain issues. The most commonly reported problems involve oil leaks, transmission harshness, and electrical glitches with the infotainment system. Suspension issues and some minor interior component failures also surface. While some repairs, like software updates, might be relatively inexpensive, others, such as replacing adaptive dampers or major engine components, can be very costly.
