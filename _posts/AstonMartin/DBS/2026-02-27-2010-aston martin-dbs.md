### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Aston Martin DBS is a remarkable vehicle with a generally solid reliability record for a supercar. While it's not immune to issues, the most commonly reported technical problems tend to be related to specific components like ignition coils, oil cooler seals, and adaptive suspension dampers. Transmission issues, particularly fluid leaks or clutch wear on manual models, can also arise. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches or central locking actuator failures, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and complexity. Owners should budget for specialized maintenance and potential repairs, as parts and labor for exotic cars are significantly more expensive than for mainstream vehicles. Regular, expert servicing is crucial to maintaining the DBS's performance and reliability.
