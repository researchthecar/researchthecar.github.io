**Summary**

The 2009 Aston Martin DBS presents a mix of potentially expensive repairs and maintenance items. Engine issues like oil leaks and coil pack failures can be relatively common. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic gearbox, can be costly. Suspension issues, particularly with the adaptive dampers, are also a concern. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, can add to the ownership burden. Overall, prospective buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Aston Martin technician are highly recommended.
