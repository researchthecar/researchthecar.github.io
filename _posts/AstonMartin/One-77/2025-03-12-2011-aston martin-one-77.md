The 2011 Aston Martin One-77 is an exclusive, limited-production supercar. With only 77 units ever produced, information regarding specific issues and complaints is scarce and often anecdotal, primarily found within exclusive owner communities and forums. The One-77 is equipped with a naturally aspirated 7.3-liter V12 engine producing 750 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automated manual transmission. Owners generally praise the car for its breathtaking design, exceptional performance, and exclusivity. Criticisms often revolve around the car's limited practicality, very high maintenance costs, and scarcity of parts and specialized service.

**Summary**

The 2011 Aston Martin One-77, while an extraordinary vehicle, suffers from common supercar problems compounded by its limited production and specialized components. Engine and transmission issues, while not widespread due to the low production numbers, can be costly to repair. Electrical and suspension problems are also potential concerns. The rarity of the car and the need for specialized technicians contribute to high repair costs. Due to the low production volume, it is rare to see any recalls on this vehicle. Potential buyers should conduct thorough inspections and due diligence before purchasing. The severity of potential issues ranges from minor sensor failures to major engine or transmission overhauls, with associated costs ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars.
