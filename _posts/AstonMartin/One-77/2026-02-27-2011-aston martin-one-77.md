# 2011 Aston Martin One-77

### Overview
The 2011 Aston Martin One-77 is an ultra-exclusive supercar, with only 77 units produced. Its bespoke nature means that reliability data is scarce and often anecdotal, focusing on the extreme performance and handcrafted elements rather than mass-market concerns.  The vehicle is powered by a naturally aspirated V12 engine, paired with a rear-mounted automated manual transmission.  Given its limited production and high price point, owners typically have access to specialized support and maintenance, which can mitigate some potential issues.  However, the complexity and exotic materials used inherently present unique challenges compared to more common vehicles.

### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Aston Martin One-77, due to its extremely limited production and bespoke nature, is not subject to typical automotive reliability metrics. While specific documented failures are rare, the complexity of its engineering and exotic materials mean that any issues, when they arise, are likely to be costly and require specialized attention. Owners should prioritize meticulous maintenance by Aston Martin specialists. The primary concerns would revolve around the sophisticated electronic systems and the potential for high repair costs on unique components, rather than widespread mechanical failures.
