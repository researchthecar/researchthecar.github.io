The 2017 Aston Martin V12 Vantage is a stunning and potent sports car, celebrated for its raw power, exhilarating driving experience, and distinctive design. It's offered as a coupe and roadster. The car's immense power, direct steering, and relatively compact size provide a thrilling, old-school sports car feel that many enthusiasts appreciate. Common complaints often revolve around its firm ride, limited practicality, and the high running costs associated with a high-performance, low-volume vehicle. While some enjoy the engaging manual transmission, others find the automated manual gearbox to be less refined than modern dual-clutch systems. The V12 Vantage came standard with a 5.9-liter V12 engine producing 565 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque and was available with either a 7-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed Sportshift III automated manual transmission. The V12 Vantage S was an upgraded model which pushed the engine to 565 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque.
