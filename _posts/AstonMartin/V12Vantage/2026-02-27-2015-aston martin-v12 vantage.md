### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Aston Martin V12 Vantage demonstrates a commendable level of reliability for a hand-built, high-performance exotic. The core V12 engine is robust, though specific components like ignition coils and coolant hoses can require attention. The automated manual transmission, while offering a unique driving experience, can be a source of more significant repair costs if the clutch actuator or hydraulic system develops faults. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are not uncommon in vehicles of this era and complexity. Suspension components, especially the adaptive dampers, can also be costly to replace. Overall, while not immune to issues, the V12 Vantage's reliability is generally good, provided regular maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging problems.
