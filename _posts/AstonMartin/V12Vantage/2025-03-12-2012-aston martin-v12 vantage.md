The 2012 Aston Martin V12 Vantage is a highly desirable sports car renowned for its stunning design, exhilarating performance, and the symphony of its V12 engine. Available as a coupe, it came equipped with a potent 6.0L V12 engine producing 510 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. While some owners adore the car's raw power, driver-focused experience, and exclusive nature, others express concerns about running costs, reliability, and the inherent challenges of owning a low-production, high-performance vehicle. A 6-speed manual transmission was the only available option.
