The 2016 Aston Martin V12 Vantage represents the pinnacle of Aston Martin's driver-focused sports cars, pairing a powerful V12 engine with a relatively compact and agile chassis. The available engines included a naturally aspirated 6.0L V12 producing 565 hp and 457 lb-ft of torque. The transmission choices included a 7-speed Sportshift III automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the V12 Vantage for its exhilarating performance, stunning design, and exclusivity. Criticisms sometimes include the automated manual transmission's occasional jerky shifts, the firm ride, and relatively high running costs. This car is known to have some reliability issues and can be quite expensive to maintain.

**Engine**

**6.0L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets on the V12 engine, often manifesting as oil spots under the car or a burning smell. Common leak points include the valve cover gaskets, timing cover gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets and seals. Thorough cleaning of the engine bay is recommended after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the location and complexity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light can result from coil pack failures. The V12 engine has individual coil packs for each cylinder.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack(s). It's often recommended to replace all coil packs at once to avoid future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on how many coil packs are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, poor fuel economy, and difficulty starting can be caused by failing or clogged fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on number of injectors needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Sportshift III 7-Speed Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sportshift III transmission uses a single clutch, which can wear out over time, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping, difficulty engaging gears, and jerky shifts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch. The clutch adaptation process is crucial after installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sportshift III transmission relies on a hydraulic pump to operate the gear changes. Failure of this pump can result in difficulty shifting, error messages on the dashboard, and ultimately, complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gear Position Sensor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate gear readings, error messages, or the transmission getting stuck in a particular gear can occur due to faulty gear position sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gear position sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with the adaptive damping system, individual dampers can fail, leading to uneven ride quality, clunking noises, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty adaptive damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ per damper (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bushings Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, suspension bushings wear out, leading to sloppy handling, vibrations, and noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of bushing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rapid battery drain, especially when the car is not in use, can be a common issue due to parasitic draws. This can be difficult to diagnose and may require specialized equipment to isolate the source of the drain.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic drain. This could involve replacing faulty modules, repairing wiring harnesses, or updating software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the source and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car can fail, leading to error messages, performance issues, and malfunctioning systems. Examples include oxygen sensors, crankshaft position sensors, and ABS sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the sensor and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can suffer from glitches, freezing, and unresponsive touchscreen.
    * Solution: Resetting or updating the software. Replacement may be necessary in some cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to reduced visibility and potential damage to the headlight components.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlight housings, drying them out, and resealing them. In some cases, the entire headlight assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticking Buttons**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Interior buttons, particularly those on the center console, can become sticky and difficult to press due to the deterioration of the soft-touch coating.
