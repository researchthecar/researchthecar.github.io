Alright, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish, formatted for your website.

The 2018 Aston Martin Vanquish represents the pinnacle of Aston Martin's grand touring prowess. It came standard with a naturally aspirated 5.9L V12 engine, producing 580 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed Touchtronic III automatic transmission.
