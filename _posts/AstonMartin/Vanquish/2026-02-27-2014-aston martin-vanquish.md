### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Aston Martin Vanquish, while a magnificent machine, requires diligent maintenance and awareness of potential issues common to high-performance, luxury vehicles. The V12 engine, though generally robust, can experience ignition coil failures and oil cooler leaks, which are costly to repair. The automatic transmission is largely reliable, but fluid leaks can occur. The adaptive suspension's electronic dampers are a known point of expense if they fail. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also documented. Exterior and interior components, benefiting from Aston Martin's premium materials and build quality, tend to hold up well. Owners should budget for specialized maintenance and potential repairs to keep this exotic in peak condition.
