### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Aston Martin Vanquish is a remarkable supercar with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly its V12 engine. However, its complexity and age mean that certain components, such as ignition coils, coolant system parts, and transmission control units, can be prone to failure. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and infotainment, are also noted. Suspension components, particularly the adaptive dampers, can be expensive to repair. While not plagued by widespread, catastrophic failures, owners should budget for specialized maintenance and potential repairs, especially for the transmission and electrical systems. Regular servicing by marque specialists is highly recommended to mitigate potential issues and maintain the vehicle's performance and value.
