**Transmission**

**Automated Manual (ASM)**

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, and jerky shifting. Due to the automated nature of the transmission, clutch wear can be accelerated if not properly maintained and driven.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly. This also often includes replacing the clutch position sensor and potentially the actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automated manual transmission relies on a hydraulic pump to operate the clutch and gear changes. Pump failures can lead to an inability to shift gears, transmission warning lights, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump and ensuring proper fluid levels and system pressures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Actuator Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, inability to select gears, or erratic shifting behavior. The actuator controls gear selection and clutch engagement.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the actuator unit. This may involve replacing solenoids or other internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Vanquish features adaptive dampers that can wear out or fail. This can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and warning lights on the dashboard.

**Summary**

The 2003 Aston Martin Vanquish, while a beautiful and powerful car, is known for its potential for expensive repairs. The most significant issues revolve around the automated manual transmission, which can suffer from clutch wear, hydraulic pump failures, and actuator problems. Engine oil leaks and electrical issues, like instrument cluster failures, are also common. While some repairs might be relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly. Potential buyers should factor in these potential costs when considering a Vanquish and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified Aston Martin mechanic.
