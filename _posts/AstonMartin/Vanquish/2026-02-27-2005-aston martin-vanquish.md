### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Aston Martin Vanquish is a desirable supercar with a complex V12 engine and a sophisticated transmission. While the exterior and interior generally exhibit good build quality, potential buyers should be prepared for the significant costs associated with maintaining its V12 powertrain, particularly concerning ignition systems, cooling, and timing components. Transmission issues, though less common, can also be expensive to rectify. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment and locking systems, are also a possibility. Proactive maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended to mitigate potential reliability concerns and associated repair expenses.
