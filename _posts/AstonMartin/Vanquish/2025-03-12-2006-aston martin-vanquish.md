The 2006 Aston Martin Vanquish is a grand tourer known for its stunning design and powerful performance. It came equipped with a naturally aspirated 6.0-liter V12 engine producing around 450 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. Power was delivered through a six-speed automated manual transmission, sometimes referred to as a "single-clutch automated manual" or "ASM." Owners often praise the Vanquish for its exotic styling, luxurious interior, and exhilarating driving experience. However, common complaints include the complexity of the automated manual transmission, potentially high maintenance costs, and the unreliability of some electronic components.

**Engine**

**6.0L V12**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may occur from various locations on the engine, including the valve covers, timing cover, and oil pan. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. In some cases, resealing the affected area may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can develop from hoses, radiator, or water pump. Overheating can occur if the leak is significant.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking components and properly bleed the cooling system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automated Manual (ASM)**

* **Clutch Wear and Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The automated manual transmission uses a clutch to engage and disengage the engine. Premature clutch wear is a common issue due to the complexity of the system and driving habits. Symptoms include slipping, jerky engagement, difficulty shifting, and error messages on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Clutch replacement is necessary when it wears out. The clutch system should be properly recalibrated after replacement. Some owners opt to convert to a fully manual transmission, though this is a significant undertaking.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ for clutch replacement or significantly more for a manual conversion.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The ASM transmission uses a hydraulic pump to build pressure for shifting. This pump can fail over time, leading to shifting problems or complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replace the hydraulic pump and ensure the hydraulic system is properly bled.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission ECU Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission ECU (Electronic Control Unit) controls the shifting process. Faulty ECUs can lead to erratic shifting, error messages, and transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replace or repair the ECU. Recalibration is necessary after replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Damper Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The adaptive dampers on the Vanquish can sometimes fail, leading to a poor ride quality and error messages on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty dampers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per damper, depending on the source.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vanquish models are known for having issues with batteries draining after sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a variety of issues, including a faulty immobilizer, parasitic draw from aftermarket electronics, or a failing battery.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the battery drain and repair the underlying issue. This may involve replacing the battery, repairing faulty wiring, or removing aftermarket accessories.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors around the vehicle (e.g., ABS sensors, crankshaft position sensors) can fail, leading to warning lights and performance issues.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on the location and type.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Electronic Component Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Vanquish uses a number of electronic components within the cabin. These parts are known to have failures, which include but are not limited to window switches, navigation screens, or seat control motors.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty part.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the affected component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Aston Martin Vanquish is a beautiful and powerful car but comes with potential reliability concerns. The most significant issues revolve around the automated manual transmission, which can experience clutch wear, hydraulic pump failure, and ECU problems, leading to costly repairs. Electrical issues such as battery drain and sensor failures can also be troublesome. While less frequent, engine oil and coolant leaks can also contribute to ownership expenses. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to maintaining the Vanquish's performance and value.
