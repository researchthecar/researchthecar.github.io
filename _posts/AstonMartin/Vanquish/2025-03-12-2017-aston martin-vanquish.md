**Engine**

**5.9L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from various engine seals and gaskets, often noticed as oil spots under the car or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking seals and gaskets. Common culprits include valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine performance due to faulty ignition coils. The check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per coil, depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Touchtronic III 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, particularly at lower speeds. May also manifest as hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the root cause, which could range from low transmission fluid to a faulty valve body or solenoids. A transmission flush and fluid replacement might offer a temporary fix, but more significant issues may require valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $3000+ (valve body replacement or rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights related to the suspension system, a noticeable change in ride quality (e.g., excessively stiff or bouncy), and uneven tire wear. These can arise from failure of the electronic dampers.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific fault and replacing the affected damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ per damper, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery drains quickly, especially when not driven regularly. This can be due to parasitic draw from various electronic components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve inspecting and replacing faulty modules, sensors, or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation issues with the infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacing the head unit, or repairing faulty wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on the severity.

    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$2000+ depending on labor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Aston Martin Vanquish, while a stunning and capable grand tourer, can be subject to various issues. Oil leaks, coil pack failures, and harsh shifting are the most pressing mechanical concerns. Electrical glitches, including battery drain and infotainment issues, also plague some owners. Suspension problems related to the adaptive dampers can be costly to address. Overall, potential buyers should factor in the high maintenance costs and potential for expensive repairs when considering a Vanquish.
