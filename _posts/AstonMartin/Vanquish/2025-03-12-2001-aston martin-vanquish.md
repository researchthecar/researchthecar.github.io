The 2001 Aston Martin Vanquish is a grand tourer known for its striking design, powerful V12 engine, and luxurious interior. It was offered with a single engine and transmission option. The Vanquish is praised for its performance and handcrafted quality. However, it is also known for its complex electronics and potentially high maintenance costs. The engine available was a 5.9L V12 producing 460 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. The transmission was a six-speed automated manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Vanquish's unique styling and driving experience but may find its reliability and repair expenses challenging.

**Engine**

**5.9L V12**

* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, check engine light. Individual coil packs can fail, leading to these symptoms.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty coil pack(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil pack (including labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, low oil level.  The Vanquish V12 is prone to various oil leaks, particularly from valve cover gaskets, timing cover seals, and the rear main seal.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals. Requires significant labor to access some of these areas.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, low coolant level, visible coolant leaks. Hoses and the water pump can develop leaks.
    * Solution: Replacing leaking hoses, water pump, or radiator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automated Manual (ASM)**

* **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, grinding noises. The automated manual transmission's clutch is a known wear item, and its lifespan depends on driving style.
    * Solution: Clutch replacement. Requires specialized tools and knowledge.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ including labor and potentially replacing the clutch actuator.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Actuator Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, failure to engage gears, transmission warning lights. The ASM system relies on actuators to engage and disengage the clutch and shift gears. These actuators can fail due to age and wear.
    * Solution: Actuator repair or replacement. May require reprogramming.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ depending on the actuator and the extent of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission malfunctions, warning lights, inability to shift gears. The ASM system uses a hydraulic pump to build pressure for shifting. This pump can fail.
    * Solution: Replacement of the hydraulic pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ including labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Ride Height Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Incorrect ride height, suspension warning lights. The Vanquish uses electronically controlled suspension, and the ride height sensors can fail, leading to these issues.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty ride height sensor(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per sensor (including labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Damper Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Poor ride quality, knocking noises, fluid leaks from dampers. The dampers themselves can fail, leading to reduced ride quality and handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty damper(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $4000+ for a set of dampers (including labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Central Control Module (CCM) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various electrical malfunctions, including issues with lights, windows, and other systems. The CCM controls many of the car's electrical functions, and it can be prone to failure.
    * Solution: CCM repair or replacement. Requires reprogramming.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $5000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether repair or replacement is necessary.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting.  The Vanquish can suffer from parasitic battery drain due to various electrical issues.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the source of the drain. This can be time-consuming and require specialized knowledge.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the source of the drain.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, including issues with lights, sensors, and other systems. The wiring harnesses in the Vanquish can degrade over time, leading to these problems.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of damaged wiring.

**Summary**

The 2001 Aston Martin Vanquish, while a beautiful and powerful car, is known for its potential reliability issues and high maintenance costs. Engine oil leaks and clutch wear in the automated manual transmission are common and potentially expensive to address. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the CCM and wiring harnesses, can also be a source of frustration. While some repairs may be relatively inexpensive, major issues like transmission or CCM failures can lead to significant expenses. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchase decision and maintenance budget.
