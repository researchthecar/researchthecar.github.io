**Introduction to the 2002 Aston Martin Vanquish**

The 2002 Aston Martin Vanquish is a high-performance grand tourer that was produced from 2001 to 2005. It was the first Aston Martin to be designed and built under Ford's ownership and was powered by a 5.9-liter V12 engine that produced 460 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. The Vanquish was available with a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission.

Owners of the Vanquish generally praise its stunning design, powerful engine, and luxurious interior. However, there have been some reported issues with the vehicle, which we will detail below.

**Engine**

**5.9-liter V12 with 6-speed manual transmission**

* **VANOS system failure:** The VANOS system is responsible for controlling the timing of the engine's valves. Failure of this system can lead to a loss of power, reduced fuel economy, and increased emissions. **Solution:** Replacement of the VANOS system. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $4,000+
* **Intake manifold gasket leak:** A leak in the intake manifold gasket can cause a loss of power, rough idling, and increased emissions. **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Oxygen sensor failure:** Oxygen sensors monitor the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gases. Failure of an oxygen sensor can lead to a decrease in fuel economy and an increase in emissions. **Solution:** Replacement of the oxygen sensor. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+
* **Throttle position sensor failure:** The throttle position sensor measures the position of the throttle valve. Failure of this sensor can lead to a loss of power, rough idling, and increased emissions. **Solution:** Replacement of the throttle position sensor. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+

**5.9-liter V12 with 5-speed automatic transmission**

* **Transmission fluid leaks:** The transmission fluid helps to lubricate and cool the transmission. Leaks can occur at the transmission pan gasket, the output shaft seal, or the input shaft seal. **Solution:** Replacement of the leaking seal. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+
* **Shift solenoid failure:** Shift solenoids control the flow of transmission fluid into and out of the transmission's clutches. Failure of a shift solenoid can lead to harsh shifting, slipping gears, or no shifting at all. **Solution:** Replacement of the failed shift solenoid. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $800+
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter is a fluid coupling that connects the engine to the transmission. Failure of the torque converter can lead to a loss of power, slipping gears, or no movement at all. **Solution:** Replacement of the torque converter. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension strut mount failure:** The front suspension strut mount is a bearing that allows the suspension strut to rotate. Failure of the strut mount can lead to a clunking noise, vibration, and reduced handling. **Solution:** Replacement of the strut mount. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Rear shock absorber failure:** The rear shock absorbers help to dampen the suspension and provide a smooth ride. Failure of a shock absorber can lead to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and increased wear on other suspension components. **Solution:** Replacement of the shock absorber. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Sway bar link failure:** Sway bar links connect the sway bar to the suspension. Failure of a sway bar link can lead to clunking noises, reduced handling, and increased wear on other suspension components. **Solution:** Replacement of the sway bar link. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** A battery drain can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a parasitic draw from the electrical system or a faulty battery. **Solution:** Diagnosis and repair of the underlying cause. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $500+
* **Alternator failure:** The alternator is responsible for recharging the battery. Failure of the alternator can lead to a dead battery, electrical problems, and a loss of power. **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Starter failure:** The starter is responsible for starting the engine. Failure of the starter can prevent the engine from starting. **Solution:** Replacement of the starter. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof leaks:** The sunroof can leak water into the cabin during heavy rain or when the sunroof is left open during a rainstorm. **Solution:** Replacement of the sunroof seal. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Door lock actuator failure:** The door lock actuator is responsible for locking and unlocking the doors. Failure of the door lock actuator can prevent the door from locking or unlocking. **Solution:** Replacement of the door lock actuator. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+
* **Power window failure:** The power window motors can fail, causing the windows to become inoperative. **Solution:** Replacement of the power window motor. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+ per window

**Interior**

* **Center console trim peeling:** The center console trim can peel or crack over time. **Solution:** Replacement of the center console trim. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Navigation system failure:** The navigation system can fail, causing the system to become inoperative. **Solution:** Replacement of the navigation system. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Heater/AC failure:** The heater or air conditioning system can fail, causing the system to become inoperative. **Solution:** Diagnosis and repair of the underlying cause. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+

**Summary**

The 2002 Aston Martin Vanquish is a high-performance grand tourer that offers stunning design, a powerful engine, and a luxurious interior. However, there are some potential issues that owners should be aware of, including engine VANOS system failures, transmission fluid leaks, and suspension strut mount failures. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but owners should be prepared to spend a significant amount of money on repairs if necessary.
