**Summary**

The 2004 Aston Martin Vanquish, while beautiful and powerful, is known to have several common issues. The most significant problems are related to the automated manual transmission, which can be costly to repair or replace. Electrical issues and suspension problems can also contribute to the overall ownership cost. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential expenses and factor them into their purchase decision. Due to its age and complex systems, pre-purchase inspections by a qualified Aston Martin technician are highly recommended.
