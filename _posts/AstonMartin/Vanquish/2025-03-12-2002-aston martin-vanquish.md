Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2002 Aston Martin Vanquish, categorized for clarity.

The 2002 Aston Martin Vanquish, a stunning grand tourer, boasted a 5.9-liter V12 engine producing 460 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. It was available exclusively with a six-speed automated manual transmission (often referred to as a "flappy paddle" or "ASM" transmission). Owners often praise the Vanquish for its beautiful design, luxurious interior, and the exhilarating sound of its V12 engine. Common complaints include the unrefined automated manual transmission, potential electrical gremlins, and the high cost of maintenance and repairs.

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, jerky gear changes, transmission malfunction warnings.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement, potentially including resurfacing or replacing the flywheel. Software updates *may* improve clutch engagement in some cases, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ depending on shop rates and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slow or failed gear changes, transmission malfunction warnings, inability to select gears. The ASM system relies on a hydraulic pump to build pressure for gear actuation.
