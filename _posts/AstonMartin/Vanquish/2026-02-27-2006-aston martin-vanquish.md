### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Aston Martin Vanquish is a remarkable supercar with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly its V12 engine. However, its exotic nature means that reliability is relative to its peers and expectations. Potential issues tend to be concentrated in complex electrical systems, adaptive suspension components, and the specialized transmission. While the engine itself is robust, maintenance items like ignition coils and coolant hoses can be costly. Owners must budget for specialized maintenance and potential repairs, as parts and labor are significantly more expensive than for mainstream vehicles. Despite these considerations, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to any developing issues, the Vanquish can offer a rewarding ownership experience.
