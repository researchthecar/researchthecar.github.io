**Engine**

**4.0L Twin-Turbo V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil drips observed under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level warnings. Oil leaks often appear around the valve cover gaskets or the oil cooler lines.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or lines. Verify proper torque of fasteners during reassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the location and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine bay, reduced engine power, check engine light illumination, possible boost leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the turbocharger system, including checking for leaks and inspecting the turbocharger for damage. Replacement of the faulty turbocharger may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ depending on if one or both turbos are replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky gear changes, especially during low-speed driving. Hesitation when accelerating or decelerating.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. If the problem persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may be required. In some cases, valve body issues can cause these symptoms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software recalibration) to $500+ (fluid change) to $2,000+ (valve body repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into Drive or Reverse and the vehicle actually moving.
    *   Solution: Inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush might help. However, this symptom can indicate more serious internal transmission wear requiring a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500+ (fluid change) to $5,000+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting unevenly, suspension warning lights illuminated, ride height adjustment not working, compressor failing to inflate the system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the air suspension system, including checking for leaks in the air struts or lines. Replacement of faulty struts, compressor, or ride height sensors may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, system crashes, Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates can often resolve minor glitches. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $2,000+ (unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty readings from various sensors, such as parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, or tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS).
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on the type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sensors are overly sensitive causing the alarm to go off when it shouldn't.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on the type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Aston Martin DBX707, while a powerful and luxurious SUV, does have some reported issues. The most common issues seem to revolve around oil leaks in the engine, rough shifting in the transmission, and air suspension malfunctions. The infotainment system and various sensors can also present problems.
