The 2020 Aston Martin DB11 is a grand tourer known for its stunning design, luxurious interior, and powerful engine options. In 2020, it was available with either a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine sourced from Mercedes-AMG, producing 503 horsepower and 513 lb-ft of torque, or a 5.2-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 630 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the DB11 for its elegant styling, comfortable ride, and exhilarating performance. However, common complaints include concerns about reliability, infotainment system glitches, and the high cost of ownership and maintenance.

**Engine**

**4.0L Twin-Turbo V8**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may occur from various locations on the engine, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or turbocharger lines. These leaks can result in a burning oil smell, visible oil puddles under the car, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the leak and replacing the affected gasket or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on the location and complexity of the repair).
