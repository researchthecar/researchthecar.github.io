### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Aston Martin DB11 is a highly desirable supercar with a generally strong reliability record for its class. However, potential owners should be aware of specific areas that may require attention. The twin-turbocharged engines, while powerful, can experience issues with wastegate actuators (V12) or engine mounts and oil coolers (V8). The ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, while robust, can sometimes suffer from TCM or mechatronics unit glitches.
