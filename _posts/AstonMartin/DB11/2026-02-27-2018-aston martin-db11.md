### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Aston Martin DB11, particularly models equipped with the V12 engine, exhibits a generally strong reliability record for its class. The most frequently cited technical issues revolve around the turbocharger wastegate actuators and potential degradation of engine mounts on the V12 variants. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted concerns that may require professional diagnosis. The V8 models and the ZF automatic transmission have proven to be more robust. While suspension and interior components are largely reliable, the advanced adaptive damping system can be a source of costly repairs if it malfunctions. Overall, the DB11 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential owners should budget for the possibility of addressing specific, albeit not pervasive, technical challenges.
