Both the V12 and V8 engines, along with the ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, are robust and have not shown widespread issues. The suspension system also appears to be well-engineered. The primary areas where minor concerns have been noted are within the electrical system, specifically occasional infotainment glitches and, less commonly, intermittent battery drain issues. These are not typically indicative of fundamental design flaws but rather common electronic gremlins that can affect high-end vehicles. Exterior and interior components, including upholstery and bodywork, are generally free from significant reported problems. Overall, the DB11 offers a reliable grand touring experience, with potential issues being manageable and largely confined to the sophisticated electronic systems.
