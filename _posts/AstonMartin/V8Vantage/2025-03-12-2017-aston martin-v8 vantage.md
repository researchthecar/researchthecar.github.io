The 2017 Aston Martin V8 Vantage is a head-turning sports car celebrated for its stunning design, engaging driving dynamics, and the unmistakable sound of its naturally aspirated V8 engine. Available as both a coupe and roadster, it represents the last of a generation before Aston Martin transitioned to turbocharged engines. The 2017 V8 Vantage is powered by a 4.7-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine, producing 430 horsepower and 361 lb-ft of torque. It could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed Sportshift II automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the car's aesthetics, handling, and the visceral experience it provides, while some criticisms include the outdated infotainment system, limited interior space, and the sometimes jerky operation of the Sportshift II transmission.

**Engine**

**4.7L Naturally Aspirated V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coils Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and decreased power can be caused by failing ignition coils. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to misfires will be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil(s). It is recommended to replace coils in pairs or all at once for preventive maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per coil depending on if it's replaced at a dealership or independent shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Sportshift II Automated Manual**

*   **Jerky Shifting/Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Sportshift II transmission is known for its sometimes jerky and unrefined shifting, especially at lower speeds. Premature clutch wear can also occur due to the nature of the automated manual system. Symptoms include harsh gear changes, slippage, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes improve shifting smoothness. Clutch replacement is required when wear becomes excessive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: TCM Software Update: $100 - $300; Clutch Replacement: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the dampers (shock absorbers) can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll. Noises such as clunking or squeaking from the suspension can also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per damper, depending on location and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The V8 Vantage is known to have parasitic battery drain issues, especially if not driven regularly. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery after a period of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and address the source of the battery drain, which could be a faulty module or accessory. A battery tender/maintainer is recommended for vehicles not driven frequently.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be slow, outdated, and prone to glitches. Problems may include unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes address these issues, but the system's hardware is inherently dated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $100 - $300; Replacement (aftermarket options exist): $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door handle mechanism, particularly on older models, can fail, making it difficult to open the doors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door handle actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: On some models, certain interior trim pieces (especially those with a soft-touch coating) can become sticky or tacky over time due to degradation of the material.
    *   Solution: Professional cleaning or replacement of the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the piece and method of repair/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Aston Martin V8 Vantage, while a beautiful and engaging sports car, is not without its potential issues. Engine oil leaks and ignition coil failures are common concerns, and the Sportshift II transmission is known for its less-than-smooth operation and potential clutch wear. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, can also be frustrating. While some issues can be minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as transmission or suspension repairs, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their ownership costs. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Aston Martin mechanic is highly recommended.
