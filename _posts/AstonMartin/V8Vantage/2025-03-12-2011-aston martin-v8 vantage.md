The 2011 Aston Martin V8 Vantage is a beautiful and sporty grand tourer known for its elegant design, luxurious interior, and engaging driving experience. The most common engine found in the 2011 V8 Vantage is a 4.7L V8 engine producing 420 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. In addition to the 4.7L V8, some 2011 models may have the older 4.3L V8. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed Sportshift automated manual transmission. Owners appreciate the car's stunning looks, exhilarating exhaust note, and the visceral feel of driving a hand-built sports car. However, some common complaints revolve around the car's reliability, potentially high running costs, and the sometimes clunky operation of the Sportshift transmission.

**Engine**

**4.7L V8**
* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common on the 4.7L V8, often stemming from the valve cover gaskets, timing cover, and oil pan. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. This may require removing engine components for access.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the location and complexity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are frequently reported, particularly around the water pump, thermostat housing, and radiator hoses. Symptoms include visible coolant leaks, low coolant levels, overheating, and a sweet coolant smell.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty component and potentially flushing the cooling system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500 depending on the source and severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.3L V8**
* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.7L, the 4.3L V8 is prone to oil leaks from valve cover gaskets, timing cover, and oil pan.
