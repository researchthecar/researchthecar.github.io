### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Aston Martin V8 Vantage is a desirable sports car with a generally strong reliability record, especially concerning its core V8 powertrain. The manual transmission is particularly robust. The automated manual transmission (Sportshift II) can occasionally present issues with its clutch actuator, which is a known, albeit not universal, concern. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are the most commonly cited non-major issues. While not as prone to problems as some other exotics, owners should budget for potential repairs related to the transmission's automated system and the infotainment unit. Regular servicing by qualified technicians is paramount for maintaining its performance and reliability.
