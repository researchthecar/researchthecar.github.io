The 2012 Aston Martin Rapide is a luxury grand tourer known for its elegant design, powerful performance, and exclusivity. It came equipped with a 6.0-liter V12 engine producing 470 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed Touchtronic 2 automatic transmission. While praised for its stunning aesthetics, luxurious interior, and thrilling driving experience, some owners have reported experiencing certain issues. A common dislike is the relatively tight rear seating for a car of its size, and the running costs can be high due to maintenance and fuel consumption.

**Engine**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often stemming from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or timing cover. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals is the typical solution. Thorough cleaning of the affected area after the repair is also necessary.

    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with the correct Aston Martin-specified fluid can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300+ for a fluid flush, $1000 - $3000+ for valve body work.
