The 2012 Aston Martin Virage is a grand tourer powered by a 6.0-liter V12 engine producing 490 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. It was only offered with a Touchtronic II six-speed automatic transmission. People appreciate the Virage for its stunning design, luxurious interior, and powerful engine sound. Some dislike its relatively outdated infotainment system and higher running costs compared to other grand tourers.

**Engine**

    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may help in some cases. More severe cases might require valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 for fluid flush, $1,500 - $4,000+ for valve body work or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Virage is equipped with adaptive dampers. These can fail, leading to a noticeably harsh or bouncy ride. A warning light might illuminate on the dashboard.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many Aston Martin owners report excessive battery drain, especially when the car is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Ensure the battery is in good condition. Use a battery maintainer when the car is not in use. Diagnose and repair any parasitic drains (e.g., faulty modules not shutting down properly).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 for a new battery, $100 - $500+ for diagnosing and repairing parasitic drains.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be slow, buggy, and prone to freezing. Bluetooth connectivity issues are also common.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per switch (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Aston Martin Virage, while a beautiful and powerful grand tourer, can suffer from several common issues. Oil leaks, coil pack failures, and transmission problems are the primary engine and drivetrain concerns. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment system glitches, are also frequently reported. Suspension and exterior issues, like adaptive damper failures and door handle problems, can add to the ownership costs. While the issues are not catastrophic, the potential for high repair bills should be a consideration for prospective buyers. The severity ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, with estimated costs varying widely depending on the specific issue.
