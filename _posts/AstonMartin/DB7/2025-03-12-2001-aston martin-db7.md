The 2001 Aston Martin DB7 is a grand tourer that blends British luxury with performance. The 2001 model year typically features a 3.2-liter inline-6 supercharged engine producing around 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The DB7 is praised for its elegant design and comfortable ride, but some owners have noted concerns about reliability, particularly with electrical components and specific engine parts. Available transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Dislikes often revolve around the high cost of maintenance and repairs, reflecting the car's exotic nature.

**Engine**

**3.2L Inline-6 Supercharged**

*   **Supercharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger can experience wear and tear, leading to reduced boost, unusual noises (whining or rattling), and decreased engine performance. This is common in higher mileage examples.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the supercharger unit. A rebuild might involve replacing bearings, seals, and other worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on whether rebuilt or replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light indicating issues with one or more ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all coils at once for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (depending on how many coils are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from hoses, radiator, or water pump. Overheating may occur if the leaks are severe.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component. Inspect all hoses, the radiator, water pump, and thermostat housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the source and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may hesitate or slip between gears. Shifts may be jerky or harsh.
    *   Solution: A transmission service with new fluid and filter may resolve minor issues. More severe problems may require a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (service) - $5,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on which bushings need replacement and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Shock Absorbers/Dampers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in corners.
    *   Solution: Replace the shock absorbers/dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (depending on brand of shock)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Electrical Gremlins**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as non-functioning lights, erratic gauge readings, or issues with the central locking system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the specific electrical fault. This may involve tracing wires, replacing faulty relays or sensors, or repairing damaged wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ (highly variable, depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not in use.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the parasitic drain. This could be a faulty module, a malfunctioning accessory, or a wiring issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion**
