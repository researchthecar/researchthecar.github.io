### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Aston Martin DB7, while a desirable exotic car, requires diligent maintenance to ensure reliability. The V12 engine, though powerful, can present issues like ignition coil failures and coolant leaks, with timing chain tensioner wear being a significant concern requiring proactive attention. Automatic transmission issues such as torque converter seal leaks and solenoid pack failures are noted. Manual transmissions are generally more robust but clutch wear is a common item. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the ECU and window regulators, can also arise. Despite these potential issues, with proper care and specialized servicing, the DB7 can remain a rewarding ownership experience.
