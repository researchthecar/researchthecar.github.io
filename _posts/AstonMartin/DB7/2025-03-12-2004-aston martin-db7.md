The 2004 Aston Martin DB7 is a grand tourer that represents a blend of British craftsmanship and performance. The 2004 DB7 was only available with one engine option, a 5.9L V12 engine producing 420 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. The transmission option was either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners typically praise the DB7 for its elegant styling, comfortable ride, and the distinctive sound of its V12 engine. Conversely, common criticisms include the car's age-related maintenance requirements, potentially high running costs, and some concerns regarding the reliability of certain components.

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, front and rear main seals, and oil cooler lines. These leaks can manifest as oil spots on the garage floor, a burning oil smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the primary solution. In some cases, addressing the leaks might involve resealing the engine's front or rear covers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the leak location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating can occur due to radiator leaks, failing water pumps, or thermostat malfunctions. Symptoms include the engine temperature gauge reading high, coolant leaks, and steam coming from under the hood.
    *   Solution: Addressing cooling system issues may involve replacing the radiator, water pump, thermostat, or hoses. Flushing the cooling system is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and reduced performance can occur due to failing ignition coils. A check engine light will typically illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s) is the solution. It's often recommended to replace all coils at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed automatic transmission may exhibit slipping between gears or harsh, jerky shifting. These symptoms can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush, fluid replacement, or valve body repair could be attempted. If the issue persists, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ depending on severity and selected solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty engaging gears, or a high clutch pedal engagement point indicate clutch wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly 2nd and 3rd, can indicate worn synchros in the transmission.
    *   Solution: A transmission rebuild is required to replace the worn synchros.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises, especially over bumps, and vague handling can indicate worn suspension bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the number and location of the worn bushings.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and poor handling can indicate failing shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shock absorbers is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as the crankshaft position sensor, oxygen sensors, and mass airflow sensor, can fail, causing drivability issues and triggering the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Brittle or damaged wiring can cause intermittent electrical problems, such as lights not working, starting issues, or sensor malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the affected wiring harness sections is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop in areas such as the undercarriage, wheel wells, and around the door seams, especially in regions with harsh winters or salty environments.
    *   Solution: Addressing corrosion involves removing the rust, treating the affected area, and applying a protective coating or paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and location of the rust.

**Summary**

The 2004 Aston Martin DB7 can be a rewarding vehicle to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine oil leaks and cooling system problems are the most prevalent engine issues. Transmission issues vary depending on the specific transmission (Automatic or Manual). Suspension issues can be expected on older vehicles. Electrical issues, such as sensor failures and wiring problems, are also common. Some corrosion can be expected on older vehicles. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, but addressing them promptly can help to maintain the vehicle's performance and value. Prospective owners should factor in these potential expenses when considering a DB7 purchase.
