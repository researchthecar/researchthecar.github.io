### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Aston Martin DB7, while a desirable and powerful grand tourer, requires diligent ownership. The V12 engine, though robust, can experience issues with ignition coils, cooling system integrity, and timing chain tensioners, necessitating specialized attention. Transmission reliability is generally good, but automatic units can develop torque converter or solenoid problems, while manual clutches are subject to wear. Suspension components like dampers and bushings are common wear items on performance cars. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and switches, are not uncommon. Despite these potential challenges, with proper maintenance and prompt repairs by qualified technicians, the DB7 can remain a reliable and exhilarating vehicle.
