### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Aston Martin DB7, while a desirable and beautiful car, requires owners to be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with a luxury performance vehicle of its age. The V12 engine is generally robust but can suffer from ignition and cooling system issues. Automatic transmission problems, particularly with solenoids and torque converters, are noted. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM, are a common concern in Aston Martins of this era. Exterior corrosion on aluminum panels and convertible roof mechanism issues can be costly to address. Interior wear on leather is typical but repairable. Prospective buyers should factor in the cost of specialized maintenance and potential repairs.
