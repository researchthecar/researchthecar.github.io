    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, rear main seal, and timing chain cover. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the solution. Thoroughly cleaning the affected areas is also important to prevent future leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating is a potential problem, often caused by a failing water pump, radiator, thermostat, or coolant hoses. Symptoms include high temperature readings, coolant leaks, and steam coming from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components. It's also recommended to flush the cooling system to remove any debris or contaminants.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The V12 engine uses individual ignition coils for each cylinder. These can fail over time, leading to misfires, rough running, and a loss of power. The check engine light will often illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all the coils at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of coils replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch wear is a common issue with manual transmissions, especially with spirited driving. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, and a high clutch pedal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. It's also recommended to resurface the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Synchro wear can lead to difficulty shifting into certain gears, especially when cold. Grinding noises during gear changes are also a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic transmission can experience delayed or harsh shifting, especially as the car ages. This can be caused by worn valve bodies, low fluid levels, or internal component failure.
    *   Solution: Servicing the transmission, including fluid and filter replacement. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4000+ (depending on the severity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings and Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings and ball joints can wear out over time, leading to a loose and unstable ride. Symptoms include clunking noises, wandering steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings and ball joints. It's also recommended to get a wheel alignment after the repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The shock absorbers can fail over time, leading to a bouncy and uncomfortable ride. Symptoms include excessive body roll, poor handling, and fluid leaks from the shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty shock absorbers. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+ (depending on the type of shocks and the labor involved)
