**Introduction:**

The 1998 Aston Martin DB7 is a luxurious grand tourer that combines classic styling with modern performance. It was offered with a 3.2 liter V6 engine or a 3.2 liter V8 engine, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Despite its impressive design and performance, the DB7 has been plagued by several reliability issues that have drawn criticism from owners.

**Engine**

**3.2L V6**

* **Spark Plug Failure:** Frequent misfiring due to faulty spark plugs. The spark plugs need to be replaced with new ones. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**3.2L V8**

* **Intake Valve Failure:** Intake valves can become worn or burnt, leading to reduced engine performance and increased fuel consumption. The intake valves and valve guides need to be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual**

* **Synchronizer Wear:** Worn synchronizers can cause difficulty in shifting gears, especially when the transmission is cold. The synchronizers need to be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**4-speed Automatic**

* **Valve Body Faults:** Faulty valve bodies can lead to erratic shifting, delayed engagements, and loss of gears. The valve body needs to be reconditioned or replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000

**Exterior**

* **Window Regulator Failure:** The window regulators can fail, causing the windows to become stuck or fall off track. The window regulators need to be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may malfunction, resulting in problems with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. The faulty climate control components need to be repaired or replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**Summary**

The 1998 Aston Martin DB7 is a beautiful and desirable car, but it is not without its reliability issues. The engine, transmission, suspension, electrical, and interior systems have all been known to have problems. While some of these issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly. Potential owners should be aware of these issues before purchasing a DB7 and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
