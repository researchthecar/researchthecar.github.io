The 2000 Aston Martin DB7 is a grand tourer that marked a significant turning point for the British marque, offering a blend of classic styling and modern engineering. For the 2000 model year, the primary engine option was a 3.2-liter Supercharged Inline-6 producing around 335 horsepower and 361 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. A V12 engine was not available until the later DB7 V12 Vantage models. Owners often praise the DB7 for its elegant design and driving experience, while common complaints revolve around reliability issues and the high cost of maintenance and repairs.
