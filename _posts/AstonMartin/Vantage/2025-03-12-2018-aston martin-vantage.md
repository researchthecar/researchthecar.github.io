The 2018 Aston Martin Vantage marked a significant redesign, ushering in a more modern aesthetic and a potent powertrain. The car is powered by a Mercedes-AMG sourced 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, producing 503 horsepower and 505 lb-ft of torque. It was initially offered with an 8-speed ZF automatic transmission. A 7-speed manual transmission was later introduced for the 2020 model year. People generally praise the Vantage for its striking design, engaging driving dynamics, and the thrilling sound of its V8 engine. However, some criticisms include a cramped interior, limited storage space, and a firm ride.
