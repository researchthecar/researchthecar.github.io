The 2020 Aston Martin Vantage is a luxury sports car known for its stunning design, powerful performance, and engaging driving dynamics. It's powered by a Mercedes-AMG sourced 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 503 horsepower and 505 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a ZF 8-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Vantage's head-turning looks, exhilarating acceleration, and the distinctive Aston Martin brand cachet. On the other hand, common criticisms include a somewhat cramped interior, limited storage space, and a potentially firm ride depending on the road conditions. Reliability concerns and high maintenance costs are also frequently mentioned as potential drawbacks. A 7-speed manual transmission was available starting in 2021, so 2020 models are only equipped with the ZF 8-speed automatic.
