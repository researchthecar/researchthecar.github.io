The 2016 Aston Martin DB9 represents the final year of this iconic grand tourer, known for its elegant design, powerful performance, and luxurious appointments. Powered by a 5.9-liter naturally aspirated V12 engine producing 510 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque, it offers a thrilling driving experience. All 2016 DB9s were equipped with a Touchtronic 2 six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's stunning aesthetics, comfortable ride, and distinctive exhaust note. However, potential downsides include high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and relatively dated infotainment system compared to newer vehicles.

**Engine**

**5.9L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various points on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, timing cover seals, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil puddles under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are possible around the water pump, hoses, or radiator. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty component (water pump, hose, radiator, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+, depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Touchtronic 2 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable during low-speed driving or when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: This can sometimes be resolved with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (valve body).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slippage can occur when the transmission fails to properly engage a gear, resulting in a delayed or weak response. This can be accompanied by a rise in engine RPM without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair may involve checking the transmission fluid level and condition, inspecting the transmission for leaks, and testing the transmission's functionality. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $7000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DB9 is equipped with adaptive dampers. They can fail, leading to a noticeably degraded ride quality and potential error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty damper.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+ per damper.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive battery drain, especially if the car is left sitting for extended periods. This can be due to a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve checking the alarm system, infotainment system, and other electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (diagnosis and repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be prone to glitches, including freezing, slow response times, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2000+ (replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors or parking sensors, can malfunction, leading to warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on complexity of repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2016 Aston Martin DB9, while a beautiful and enjoyable car, can present owners with various issues.
