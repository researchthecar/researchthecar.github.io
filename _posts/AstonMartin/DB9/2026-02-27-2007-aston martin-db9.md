### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Aston Martin DB9 is a desirable luxury sports car with a generally strong mechanical foundation. However, potential owners should be prepared for the possibility of issues common to high-end, complex vehicles of this age. The V12 engine itself is robust, but its supporting systems, particularly the cooling and ignition, can require attention. The automatic transmission, while smooth, can experience torque converter or leak issues. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment and central locking systems, are also noted. Interior wear is typical for its age, but HVAC components can fail. While not a reliability benchmark compared to mass-market sedans, the DB9's issues are often manageable with proper diagnosis and specialized maintenance, albeit at a premium cost.
