### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Aston Martin DB9 is a desirable supercar with a generally solid reliability foundation, particularly concerning its iconic V12 engine and robust chassis. However, as an exotic vehicle, it is susceptible to specific, higher-cost repairs, especially in its advanced electronic systems, convertible roof mechanism (if applicable), and transmission. Proactive maintenance and addressing issues like ignition coil failures or coolant leaks promptly are crucial. While not immune to problems, the DB9's reliability is considered good for its performance class, provided it has been well-maintained by knowledgeable technicians. Owners should budget for specialized care and potential repairs related to its complex systems.
