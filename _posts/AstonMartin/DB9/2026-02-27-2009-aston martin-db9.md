### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Aston Martin DB9 is a desirable supercar with a generally good reliability record for its exotic nature. The V12 engine is robust, but maintenance is critical, with potential for costly repairs related to ignition, cooling, and timing components. The automatic transmission is solid, though torque converter and fluid leak issues can arise. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment and convertible top mechanisms (on Volante models), are the most common concerns and can be expensive to fix. Suspension components, especially adaptive dampers, can also be a significant expense if they fail. Overall, while not as trouble-free as a mass-produced sedan, the DB9 offers a rewarding ownership experience for those prepared for the specialized care and potential costs associated with a high-performance luxury vehicle.
