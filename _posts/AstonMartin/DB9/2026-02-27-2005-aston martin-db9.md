### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Aston Martin DB9 is a desirable supercar with a generally solid reliability record for its performance class. The V12 engine and Touchtronic transmission are the primary areas where owners may encounter specific, albeit often repairable, issues. Proactive maintenance, particularly concerning coolant systems and ignition components, is crucial. Electrical gremlins and interior wear are not uncommon with age but are typically manageable. While not as bulletproof as some mass-produced luxury vehicles, the DB9's reliability is considered good for a hand-built exotic, provided it has been well-maintained and any emerging issues are addressed promptly. Expect higher maintenance costs due to specialized parts and labor.
