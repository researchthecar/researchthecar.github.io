### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Aston Martin DB9, while a magnificent machine, is not without its potential reliability concerns, particularly in areas common to high-performance luxury vehicles. The V12 engine, while powerful, can be susceptible to issues like ignition coil failures and coolant leaks, with timing chain tensioner wear being a more significant concern requiring prompt attention. The automatic transmission can experience problems with the torque converter or mechatronic unit. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Less common but still reported are issues with the adaptive suspension and the unique swan door mechanisms. Owners should budget for potentially costly repairs, especially for specialized components, and prioritize regular, expert maintenance to mitigate these risks.
