**Engine**

**6.0L V12**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are frequently reported, often stemming from valve cover gaskets, oil pan gaskets, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is the standard fix. Thorough cleaning of the affected area is crucial before installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports indicate potential failures of the water pump, thermostat, or radiator hoses. Overheating, coolant leaks, and high engine temperature readings are common signs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty component is necessary. Inspecting and replacing related components like the thermostat or radiator hoses during the repair can prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the component.

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as abrupt jolts or clunking noises during gear changes.
    *   Solution: A software update may be the solution or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 for a software update, $3000+ for a rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**
*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DB9 features adaptive dampers that can fail over time, leading to a rougher ride and compromised handling. Warning lights on the dashboard may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty damper is required. It's recommended to replace dampers in pairs to maintain consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per damper, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners complain about excessive battery drain, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can result in difficulty starting or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the drain is critical. Common culprits include the alarm system, infotainment system, or other electrical modules that remain active even when the car is off. Using a battery tender can help mitigate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory infotainment system is often criticized for being outdated and unreliable. Common issues include screen failures, navigation problems, and Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the infotainment system with an aftermarket unit is a common upgrade. In some cases, repairing the factory unit may be possible, but it can be costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Mechanism Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DB9's door handles are known to be fragile, and the internal mechanisms can break, making it difficult or impossible to open the door.
    *   Solution: Replacing the door handle mechanism or the entire handle assembly is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some DB9s experience "sticky" interior trim, particularly on the center console and dashboard. This is due to the breakdown of the coating used on the plastic surfaces.
    *   Solution: Refinishing or replacing the affected trim pieces is the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the issue and the chosen repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Aston Martin DB9 presents a mixed bag of issues. While its engine and transmission are generally reliable, potential problems with oil leaks, cooling systems, and harsh shifting can lead to moderate to high repair costs. Electrical issues such as battery drain and infotainment system malfunctions are common annoyances. Furthermore, suspension and exterior issues, like door handle failures and adaptive damper problems, can significantly impact the ownership experience and wallet. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into the cost of ownership. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Aston Martin mechanic is highly recommended.
