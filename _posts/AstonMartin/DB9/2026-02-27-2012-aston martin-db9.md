### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Aston Martin DB9 is a desirable supercar with a generally robust mechanical foundation, particularly its V12 engine. However, its complexity and exotic nature mean that repairs can be costly and require specialized knowledge. Key areas to monitor include potential ignition coil issues, coolant leaks, and the intricate convertible roof mechanism on Volante models. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and various sensors, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and sophistication. While not prone to catastrophic failures if well-maintained, prospective buyers should budget for higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs, emphasizing the importance of a thorough pre-purchase inspection by an Aston Martin specialist.
