The 2013 Aston Martin DB9 is a grand tourer celebrated for its elegant design, luxurious interior, and impressive performance. It's powered by a 6.0-liter V12 engine producing 510 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Touchtronic 2 six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the DB9 for its striking aesthetics, powerful engine sound, and comfortable driving experience. However, some common complaints include higher maintenance costs due to the car's exotic nature and occasional electrical gremlins. This model year offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues and associated repair expenses.

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Individual coil pack failures can occur, leading to misfires, rough running, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack resolves the issue. It's often recommended to replace all coil packs at once for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil pack (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vacuum leaks are also a common issue with the V12. A common source of vacuum leaks is brittle or cracked vacuum lines. Symptoms include rough idling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing all of the vacuum lines and checking vacuum operated equipment for leaks
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity.

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be due to worn valve body components or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may help alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $300-$500. Valve body repair/replacement $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Mount Failure**
