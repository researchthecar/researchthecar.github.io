The 2024 Aston Martin DB12 marks a significant step forward for the brand, blending luxurious grand touring with a potent performance edge. The DB12 boasts a re-engineered version of Aston Martin's 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, producing 671 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its striking design, powerful engine, and improved interior technology compared to its predecessor (the DB11), some owners have reported a few issues. Some of the aspects people dislike include the price and the potential reliability concerns that have been historically associated with Aston Martin.

**Engine**

**4.0L Twin-Turbo V8**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported intermittent engine misfires, often accompanied by a check engine light. The issue may stem from faulty ignition coils or spark plugs not properly gapped for the high performance output.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis via OBD-II scanner, replacement of faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced occasional harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed maneuvers or aggressive acceleration. This may indicate issues with the transmission's valve body or software calibration.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration or valve body replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The new infotainment system, while a substantial improvement over previous generations, occasionally freezes, lags, or experiences glitches. Some owners have noted the navigation system is not always accurate or up to date.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $5,000+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Aston Martin DB12, while generally well-received, has some issues reported by owners. Electrical issues like infotainment glitches and sensor malfunctions appear to be relatively more common than engine or transmission problems. The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor annoyances and others requiring more substantial repairs. The cost to fix these issues also varies significantly, ranging from relatively inexpensive software updates to potentially costly component replacements. Given the limited production numbers of the DB12 and its recent release, a comprehensive picture of long-term reliability is still developing.
