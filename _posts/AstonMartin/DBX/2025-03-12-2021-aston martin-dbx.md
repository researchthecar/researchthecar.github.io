The 2021 Aston Martin DBX marked Aston Martin's entry into the luxury SUV market. It's powered by a Mercedes-AMG sourced 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 542 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option for this model year is a 9-speed automatic. People often praise the DBX for its stunning design, luxurious interior, and impressive performance, blending the Aston Martin driving experience with the practicality of an SUV. However, some criticisms include its high price point, potentially unreliable electronics and the fact that some of the switchgear and controls are borrowed from other manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz, which can detract from the exclusive feel for some buyers.
