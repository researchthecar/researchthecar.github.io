The 2024 Aston Martin DBX is a luxury SUV combining performance and elegance. The DBX is powered by a Mercedes-AMG sourced 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine. This engine delivers 542 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque in the standard DBX 707 models offering 697 horsepower and 663 lb-ft of torque. Both engine options are paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often praise the DBX for its distinctive styling, luxurious interior, and engaging driving dynamics. Criticisms often include the infotainment system, which is considered dated, and the high price point relative to competitors.
