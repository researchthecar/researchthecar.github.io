The 2022 Aston Martin DBX is a luxury performance SUV, offering a blend of British craftsmanship and exhilarating performance. The primary engine option for the 2022 model year is a 4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8 engine developed by Mercedes-AMG. This engine produces 542 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. This is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. A higher performance version, the DBX707, boosts the engine output to 697 hp. Owners generally praise the DBX for its stunning design, luxurious interior, and impressive driving dynamics. Criticisms often focus on the infotainment system's interface, which can feel dated, and occasional build quality inconsistencies.

**Summary**

The 2022 Aston Martin DBX, while lauded for its performance and aesthetics, can be prone to a few notable issues. The most severe potential problems relate to turbocharger failure and transmission roughness, which can incur significant repair costs. Electrical glitches within the infotainment and sensor systems are also common complaints. Interior rattles, while less critical, detract from the luxury experience. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's service history, or consider a pre-purchase inspection. The cost of repairs can be substantial, especially for engine and transmission-related problems.
