The 2017 Kia Niro is a hybrid subcompact crossover known for its excellent fuel economy and practicality. It's powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 139 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels via a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Niro for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and impressive MPG, averaging around 50 MPG combined. However, some common complaints include the dual-clutch transmission's occasional hesitant shifting at low speeds and reported issues with the hybrid system components.
