The primary areas where owners have reported issues tend to be related to the hybrid system's electronic components, such as warning lights and occasional performance hiccups, and the dual-clutch transmission's shifting behavior. Electrical issues, specifically with the infotainment screen and the 12V battery, are also noted.
