**Introduction**

The 2023 Kia Niro is a compact SUV that offers a variety of powertrain options, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric. The hybrid model is powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor, which produce a combined 139 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The plug-in hybrid model has a larger 1.6-liter engine and a more powerful electric motor, resulting in a combined output of 180 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. The fully electric model is powered by a 201-horsepower electric motor and has a driving range of up to 253 miles.

The Niro is praised for its fuel efficiency, spacious cabin, and comfortable ride. However, it has received some criticism for its lackluster acceleration and its somewhat bland styling.
