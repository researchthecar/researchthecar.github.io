The 2021 Kia Seltos is a subcompact SUV that offers a blend of style, practicality, and value. It's available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 146 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners appreciate the Seltos for its roomy interior, user-friendly technology, and distinctive styling. Common complaints often revolve around the DCT's behavior at low speeds and occasional reports of minor electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**2.0L Nu MPI I4**
* **Engine Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling unexpectedly, particularly at lower speeds or when idling. This can be intermittent and may not always trigger a check engine light.
    * Solution: Diagnostic testing to check for faulty sensors (crankshaft position sensor, mass airflow sensor), vacuum leaks, or issues with the fuel system. Depending on the diagnosis, replacement of faulty components or repair of vacuum leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Gamma Turbo GDI I4**
* **Engine Hesitation/Lack of Power**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or a lack of power, especially during initial acceleration or when attempting to pass. This can be more noticeable in warmer weather or at higher altitudes.
    * Solution: Diagnostic testing to check the turbocharger system for leaks or malfunctions, inspect the wastegate operation, and verify the integrity of the boost control system. Could involve replacing faulty turbocharger components, repairing leaks, or recalibrating the engine control unit (ECU).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the severity and affected components
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission - paired with 2.0L engine)**
* **Hesitation/Jerky Acceleration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a hesitation or jerky feeling during initial acceleration or when trying to speed up from a low speed. This is a common characteristic of some CVTs, but it can be more pronounced in certain driving conditions.
    * Solution: A software update can sometimes improve the smoothness of the CVT. In severe cases, inspection of the CVT may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $500+ depending on the diagnosis and required repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed DCT (Dual-Clutch Transmission - paired with 1.6L turbo engine)**
* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation at Low Speeds**
    * Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is rough shifting, particularly at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This can manifest as jerky movements, hesitation when accelerating from a standstill, or clunking noises. The DCT can feel less smooth than a traditional automatic transmission.
    * Solution: A software update can sometimes improve the smoothness of the DCT. In more serious cases, inspection and potential replacement of the clutch assembly, mechatronic unit, or other DCT components may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $2500+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**
*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect and potentially replace worn or loose suspension components, such as shock absorbers, bushings, or sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**
*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the infotainment system, including freezing, glitching, or unresponsive touchscreen.
    *   Solution: A software update can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, the infotainment system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently.
    *   Solution: Investigate for parasitic drain on the electrical system. This could be due to faulty modules, improperly installed aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery. Replacing the battery is a common first step.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Blind Spot Monitoring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have encountered issues with the Blind Spot Monitoring system failing to function correctly or displaying false alerts.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to check the sensors and wiring associated with the Blind Spot Monitoring system. Repair or replacement of faulty sensors or wiring.

The most frequently reported problems are associated with the DCT transmission in the 1.6L turbo models, manifesting as rough shifting. Engine stalling has been reported with the 2.0L model. Electrical issues, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, also occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences requiring software updates to more substantial repairs potentially costing several hundred to thousands of dollars. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase, especially if it is equipped with the DCT transmission.
