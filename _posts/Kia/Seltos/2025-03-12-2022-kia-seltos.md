Okay, here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2022 Kia Seltos, organized by component category and engine/transmission options.

The 2022 Kia Seltos is a subcompact SUV that appeals to buyers with its stylish design, available all-wheel drive, and generous features for the price. However, some owners have reported encountering certain issues. The Seltos offers two engine choices: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 146 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Common dislikes include the sometimes-sluggish acceleration with the base engine and occasional DCT hesitation, while likes include the spacious interior, user-friendly infotainment system, and overall value.
