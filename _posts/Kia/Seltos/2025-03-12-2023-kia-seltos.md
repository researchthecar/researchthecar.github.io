The 2023 Kia Seltos is a subcompact SUV known for its stylish design, user-friendly technology, and spacious interior for its class. It comes with two engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 146 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 195 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Seltos for its value, practicality, and available all-wheel drive, but some criticisms include the base engine's lack of power and some reported issues with reliability.

**Engine**

**2.0L Four-Cylinder (CVT)**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or stalling issues, especially during initial acceleration or when the engine is cold. This may be due to fuel delivery issues or sensor malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is required to determine the root cause. Could involve replacing fuel injectors, sensors (MAF, O2), or addressing software issues with an ECU reflash.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (8-Speed Automatic)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and, in severe cases, engine knocking or damage.
    *   Solution: The issue may be related to piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the cause. Repair may involve replacing piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (2.0L Engine)**

*   **Jerky Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerky or hesitant shifting, especially during acceleration or deceleration. This can be due to internal CVT issues.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (1.6L Turbo Engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained of rough or harsh shifting, particularly when shifting between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, more extensive repairs may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reboot. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues with the Automatic Emergency Braking system such as failing to brake or braking when it shouldn't.
    * Solution: Check sensors or have the system recalibrated by a professional.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof area, particularly during heavy rain.
    *   Solution: Check and clean the sunroof drain tubes to ensure they are not clogged. If the issue persists, the sunroof seal may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise is crucial. Tightening loose screws or using felt pads to dampen vibrations may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Kia Seltos, while generally well-received, exhibits several potential issues. Engine problems include hesitation with the 2.0L and potential oil consumption with the 1.6L turbo. Transmission issues range from jerky shifting in the CVT to rough shifting in the 8-speed. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system and sunroof leaks, also appear. Interior rattles and buzzes are more minor annoyances. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but major engine or transmission repairs can be expensive.
