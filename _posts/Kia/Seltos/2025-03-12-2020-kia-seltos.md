The 2020 Kia Seltos marked the model's inaugural year in the North American market. It offers a stylish design, a spacious interior for its class, and a comprehensive suite of standard features, making it an appealing option for those seeking a subcompact SUV. However, some owners have reported certain issues. Two engine options are available: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 146 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that delivers 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, coupled with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the Seltos for its value, styling, and available all-wheel drive, while some criticisms include the sometimes sluggish performance of the base engine and occasional concerns about the DCT's responsiveness.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

* **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the engine hesitates or stalls, especially during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds. This can be intermittent and may or may not trigger a check engine light.
    * Solution: Dealers often perform a software update to the Engine Control Unit (ECU) or Transmission Control Unit (TCU). In more severe cases, inspection of the fuel system or sensors may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on warranty coverage and the specific issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**CVT (Paired with 2.0L Engine)**

* **Jerky Acceleration/Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience jerky acceleration and rough shifts, especially at lower speeds. This is often attributed to the CVT's operating characteristics.
    * Solution: A software update to the Transmission Control Unit (TCU) may help smooth out the transmission's behavior. In rare cases, a CVT replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $5,000+ (depending on warranty coverage and if a replacement is needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) (Paired with 1.6L Turbo Engine)**

* **Hesitation/Lag from a Stop**
    * Description/Symptoms: This is a common complaint with DCTs in general. Owners describe a noticeable hesitation or lag when accelerating from a complete stop.
    * Solution: This is typically considered a characteristic of the DCT design. Kia dealers may recommend a TCU software update, but it might not completely eliminate the issue. Adjusting driving style (easing onto the accelerator) can help mitigate it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: In some cases, tightening or replacing the rear shock absorbers, sway bar links, or suspension bushings can resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of infotainment system freezing, glitching, or failing to connect to smartphones via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.
    * Solution: Updating the infotainment system software is often the first step. In more severe cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,000+ (depending on warranty coverage and if the head unit needs replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently.
    * Solution: Battery replacement, diagnosis of parasitic drain, or software update to prevent modules from staying active when vehicle is off.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (for battery replacement) $100-$1000+ for diagnosis of parasitic draw
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Windshield Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported windshields cracking easily from small impacts.
    * Solution: Windshield replacement
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of various rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    * Solution: Identifying and securing the source of the rattle (loose trim pieces, wiring harnesses, etc.). This can involve adding padding or tightening fasteners.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Kia Seltos, while generally a reliable vehicle, has experienced some common issues. The most prevalent concerns revolve around the CVT's performance and occasional infotainment glitches. While engine hesitation and suspension noises are also reported, they appear less frequently. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences, such as rattling noises, to more significant concerns like transmission issues. The cost to repair these problems can vary widely, depending on the nature of the issue and warranty coverage. It's important for potential buyers to be aware of these potential problems and to thoroughly inspect any used Seltos before purchase.
