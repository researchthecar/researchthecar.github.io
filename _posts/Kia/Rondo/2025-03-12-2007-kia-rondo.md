The 2007 Kia Rondo is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) that offers a blend of car-like handling and minivan-like versatility. It came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 162 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 engine producing 182 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission depending on trim. Owners often praised the Rondo for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price. Common complaints included underwhelming fuel economy (especially with the V6), some cheap interior materials, and some reliability concerns.

Engine problems, especially timing chain issues in the 2.4L and oil leaks in the 2.7L V6, are prevalent and can be costly. Suspension issues, particularly rear sagging, also contribute to overall maintenance costs. Electrical problems, such as power window and door lock actuator failures, can be inconvenient but are generally less expensive to repair.
