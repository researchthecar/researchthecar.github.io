Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2016 Kia Rondo (also known as the Kia Carens in some markets), organized by category.

The 2016 Kia Rondo is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), lauded for its versatility, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues. The 2016 Rondo was offered with a single engine option, a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 164 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Rondo's affordability and cargo capacity, but some dislike its fuel economy and relatively bland styling.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder (G4NU)**

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a knocking or ticking noise coming from the engine, especially during cold starts or at idle. This could be related to valve train components or potentially piston slap.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking valve clearances, inspecting for wear on the camshaft and lifters, and potentially using an engine stethoscope to pinpoint the source of the noise. If piston slap is suspected, engine tear-down might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and the part that needs replacing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled changes.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels closely, checking for leaks around the engine seals, and potentially performing a compression test to check for worn piston rings or cylinder walls. Consider using a higher viscosity oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+ (depending on the source and severity of the oil consumption).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rough or jerky shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change might help. If the problem persists, it could be related to the valve body or solenoids within the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+ (depending on severity and whether a fluid change, solenoid replacement, or valve body rebuild is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates or delays when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. Diagnostic scan for trouble codes. Internal mechanical issues or a failing torque converter are possible causes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$3000+ (depending on severity and part replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car is left unused for a few days. This could be due to a parasitic drain caused by a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the circuit causing the drain. Check common culprits like the radio, alarm system, or interior lights.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$500+ (depending on the component and difficulty of repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Power Windows/Locks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows or door locks.
    *   Solution: Check fuses and wiring connections. Test the window/lock switches. The window motor or door lock actuator may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per window/lock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Scan the airbag system for diagnostic trouble codes. Common causes include faulty seatbelt pretensioners, clock spring issues in the steering wheel, or a malfunctioning airbag control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the component needing replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no air blowing from the vents.
    *   Solution: Check the blower motor fuse and relay. If those are good, the blower motor itself or the blower motor resistor may be faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$300+ (depending on the component and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, potentially causing a bouncy ride. This is more likely to occur on vehicles that regularly carry heavy loads.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rear shocks and springs. Replacing worn or damaged shocks and springs will restore proper ride height and handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$600+ (depending on parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera image is distorted, blurry, or completely black.
    *   Solution: Check the camera lens for dirt or damage. Inspect the wiring connections to the camera. If the camera is faulty, replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Kia Rondo, while praised for its practicality, has reported issues ranging from engine noises and oil consumption to transmission harshness and electrical problems. The severity of these issues can vary, with some requiring minor fixes and others potentially leading to more expensive repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and consider having a thorough pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the overall condition of the vehicle.
