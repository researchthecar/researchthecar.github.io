The 2011 Kia Rondo is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), also known as a small minivan. The base engine is a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 175 horsepower and 169 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.7-liter V6 engine was also available, producing around 192 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.7L engine was paired exclusively to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Rondo for its versatile seating arrangement, good fuel economy for its class, and ample cargo space. Common dislikes include its somewhat uninspiring styling, average handling, and basic interior features on lower trims.
