The 2010 Kia Rondo is a compact MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) that offers a blend of car-like handling and minivan-like versatility. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 175 horsepower and 169 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7-liter V6 producing 192 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Rondo for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency for its class. However, some common complaints include its somewhat lackluster styling, limited cargo space compared to larger minivans, and some reliability concerns with certain components.

**Summary**

The 2010 Kia Rondo has some common issues, primarily revolving around the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Engine oil consumption in the 2.4L and timing chain issues in the 2.7L can be potentially expensive to repair. Transmission problems like harsh shifting and torque converter failure also pose significant repair costs. Other issues, such as suspension wear and electrical failures, are less severe but still require attention. Overall, while the Rondo offers practicality and value, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
