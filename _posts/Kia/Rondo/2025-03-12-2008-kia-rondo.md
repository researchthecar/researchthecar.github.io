The 2008 Kia Rondo is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) or crossover that offered a blend of practicality and affordability. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 162 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 engine producing around 192 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Rondo's spacious interior, fuel efficiency (particularly with the 4-cylinder), and value for money. Common dislikes included the somewhat unrefined driving experience, average build quality, and limited availability of certain features compared to competitors.

Suspension and electrical issues are generally less severe in terms of cost. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potential major repairs. Considering these potential problems is essential when evaluating a used 2008 Kia Rondo.
