Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2014 Kia Rondo (also known as the Kia Carens in some markets), broken down by category, engine/transmission option, and specific issues.

The 2014 Kia Rondo is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. The main engine option available for the North American market was a 2.0-liter GDI inline-4 engine producing around 164 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Rondo's versatility, cargo space, and value for money. Common complaints often revolve around the somewhat underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded, and occasional reliability concerns related to the electrical system and some engine components.

**Engine**

**2.0L GDI Inline-4**

* **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report a knocking or ticking noise coming from the engine, especially when cold or under load. This can be caused by various factors, including piston slap, connecting rod issues, or valve train problems. The noise may worsen over time and could lead to reduced engine performance or failure.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is crucial. Possible solutions include replacing the affected components (pistons, connecting rods, valves, etc.) or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and needed repairs)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low engine oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is the typical solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the location and complexity of the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report rough idling, misfires, and poor fuel economy potentially linked to faulty fuel injectors.
    * Solution: Diagnosis with an OBDII scanner to identify the affected cylinder and replacement of the faulty injector.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per injector)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting between gears, slipping during acceleration, or complete failure to shift. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or valve body issues.
    * Solution: Check and replace transmission fluid (if low or dirty). If the problem persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ (depending on the cause and extent of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vibration at certain speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can also manifest as stalling or hesitation.
    * Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of clunking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This could be related to worn sway bar bushings, struts, or control arm bushings.
    * Solution: Inspection of the rear suspension components and replacement of worn bushings or struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the specific components needing replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight or after short periods of inactivity. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include the radio, security system, or faulty sensors. Repair or replacement of the affected component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failure of one or more power windows to operate, often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    * Solution: Replacement of the window motor or regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per window)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Condensation buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    * Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly or attempting to seal the existing assembly (though this may only be a temporary fix).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per headlight assembly)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **AC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The AC blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents. This could be due to a faulty blower motor or resistor.

    * Recalls: None Found

* **Radio/Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, or unresponsive touchscreen; Bluetooth connectivity problems; or complete system failure.
    * Solution: Software update (if available), replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the severity and head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Kia Rondo/Carens has some common issues, the most prevalent appearing to be electrical issues (battery drain, power window failure) and some engine issues (oil leaks, knocking). The engine and transmission issues can be more costly if left unchecked. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and have their vehicles inspected regularly, especially as they age. While not all 2014 Rondos will experience these issues, being informed can help owners address them proactively and potentially prevent more significant damage and higher repair costs.
