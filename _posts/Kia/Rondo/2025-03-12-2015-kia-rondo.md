The 2015 Kia Rondo (also known as the Kia Carens in some markets) is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality, spacious interior, and value. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing 164 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its comfortable ride, generous cargo space, and user-friendly features. However, some common complaints include the engine's fuel economy not meeting expectations, limited legroom in the third row, and occasional issues with the infotainment system.
