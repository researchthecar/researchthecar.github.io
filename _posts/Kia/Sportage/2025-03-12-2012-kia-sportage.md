The 2012 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV that offers a blend of practicality and style. Two engine options were available: a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 176 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine that generates 260 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sportage's attractive design, spacious interior, and available features. However, some common complaints revolve around ride quality, fuel economy, and certain reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the 2.4L engine in the 2012 Kia Sportage can consume an excessive amount of oil, sometimes requiring a quart or more between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and the need for frequent oil top-ups. Symptoms include low oil pressure light, engine knocking or ticking noises, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: The common solution is to perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil consumption. Depending on the results, the fix could range from replacing the piston rings to a full engine replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced stalling or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    * Solution: This issue has been linked to the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) or Mass Airflow (MAF) sensor. Replacing the faulty sensor usually resolves the issue. Cleaning the MAF sensor may also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature turbocharger failure has been reported. Symptoms include a loss of power, whistling or screeching noises from the engine bay, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit. It's essential to diagnose any underlying issues causing the failure, such as oil starvation or excessive heat.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement when accelerating. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and replacement may help in some cases. In more severe cases, the valve body might need to be replaced or the transmission rebuilt/replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: This issue is often attributed to worn sway bar bushings or end links. Replacing these components typically resolves the noise.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced a parasitic battery drain, where the battery is drained overnight or over a few days, even when the vehicle is not in use.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the battery drain can be challenging, as it can be caused by a variety of electrical components. Common culprits include faulty door actuators, aftermarket accessories that are not properly installed, or a failing alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **ABS/Traction Control Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Illumination of the ABS or traction control warning lights. This can be accompanied by a loss of ABS or traction control functionality.
    * Solution: This can be caused by a faulty wheel speed sensor, a malfunctioning ABS module, or wiring issues. Diagnosis with a scan tool is necessary to pinpoint the problem.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof failing to open or close correctly, getting stuck, or making unusual noises.
    * Solution: The sunroof motor or track mechanism may be faulty. Replacement or repair of these components is needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, or distorted audio during phone calls.
    * Solution: Software updates for the infotainment system may resolve some connectivity issues. In other cases, the Bluetooth module may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Kia Sportage can present a range of issues, with the most concerning being engine-related problems such as excessive oil consumption, especially in the 2.4L engine, and potential turbocharger failures in the 2.0L turbo engine. These issues can be costly to repair. Transmission and electrical problems also occur, potentially leading to additional expenses. While some issues are relatively minor, others could lead to significant repair bills, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2012 Kia Sportage.
