The 2009 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV offering a blend of affordability and practicality. Two engine options were available: a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.7-liter V6 engine generating approximately 173 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission, depending on the trim level. Owners often appreciate the Sportage's low price point and decent fuel economy (especially with the 4-cylinder), but some criticize its unrefined ride quality and lackluster interior materials. Common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the engine and electrical systems.
