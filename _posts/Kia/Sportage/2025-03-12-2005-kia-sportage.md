The 2005 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV known for its affordability and practicality. Engine options included a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7-liter V6 engine producing 173 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. The transmissions available were a 5-speed manual (available only with the 2.0L engine) and a 4-speed automatic (standard with the V6, optional with the 2.0L). Owners often appreciate the Sportage's value for money and its maneuverability, while common complaints revolve around fuel economy and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2005 Kia Sportage, while generally a reliable vehicle for its time, does exhibit some common issues. The timing belt on the V6 engine requires diligent maintenance to prevent catastrophic failure. Transmission problems, especially in the automatic variant, can be costly.

Overall, owners should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their maintenance and repair budget.
