**Introduction:**

The 2022 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV with a choice of three engine and two transmission options, including a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (177 hp and 195 lb-ft), a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder (187 hp and 178 lb-ft), and a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (281 hp and 311 lb-ft). The 1.6-liter engine is paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission, while the 2.5-liter engines are mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The Sportage is praised for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and strong value proposition, but it has also been criticized for its lack of off-road capability and occasional infotainment glitches.

**Engine**

**1.6-liter Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Intake Valve Deposits:** Buildup of deposits on intake valves can cause misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine performance. Solution involves cleaning or replacing affected valves. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** A faulty tensioner can cause the timing chain to skip, resulting in catastrophic engine damage. Replacement of the tensioner and timing chain is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure:** A malfunctioning fuel pump can lead to power loss, stalling, and difficulty starting the engine. The entire fuel pump assembly needs to be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+

**2.5-liter Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

* **No Issues Found**

**2.5-liter Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Turbocharger Wastegate Failure:** A stuck wastegate can cause overboost, leading to potential engine damage. Replacement of the turbocharger is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
* **Knock Sensor Failure:** A faulty knock sensor can result in engine misfires, reduced power, and poor fuel economy. The knock sensor must be replaced. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

* **Clutch Pack Overheating:** Excessive heat buildup in the clutch packs can cause slipping, shuddering, and premature wear. Replacement of clutch packs is often required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
* **TCM (Transmission Control Module) Failure:** A failing TCM can lead to erratic shifting, transmission slipping, and potentially catastrophic transmission damage. TCM replacement is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $1,800+
* **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** This unit controls clutch engagement and shifting. A failure can cause similar symptoms to TCM failure. Replacement of the mechatronic unit is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** Vibration during acceleration can be caused by worn or faulty components within the torque converter. Replacement or rebuilding of the torque converter is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,000+
