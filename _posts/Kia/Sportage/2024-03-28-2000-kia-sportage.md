The cylinder head gasket, timing belt, and oil leaks in the 2.0L 4-cylinder engine can be costly to repair. The V6 engine is more reliable but can still have issues with the exhaust manifold. The transmission is also prone to problems, with clutch failure and transmission slipping being the most common. The interior and exterior issues are relatively minor and less expensive to fix. Overall, while the Sportage is a capable and affordable SUV, it is important to be aware of these potential issues before purchasing one.
