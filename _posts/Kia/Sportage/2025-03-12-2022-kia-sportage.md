The 2022 Kia Sportage represents the last year of the fourth generation (QL) before a major redesign. It's available with a 2.4L GDI 4-cylinder engine producing 181 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, or a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine delivering 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sportage's value, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints include a somewhat uninspired interior design and fuel economy that isn't class-leading.

**Engine**

**2.4L GDI 4-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Stalling or Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the engine stalling at low speeds or hesitating during acceleration, particularly from a stop. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: The most common fixes for stalling or hesitation are cleaning the mass airflow sensor, replacing the fuel pump, or checking the fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
