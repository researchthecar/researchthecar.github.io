The 2015 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV known for its stylish design and value. It offered two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine (182 hp, 177 lb-ft of torque) and a turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine (260 hp, 269 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Sportage's user-friendly infotainment system and spacious cargo area for its class. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, particularly with the turbo engine, and some reported reliability concerns as the vehicle ages.
