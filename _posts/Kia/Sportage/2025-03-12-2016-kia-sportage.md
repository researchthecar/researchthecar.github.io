The 2016 Kia Sportage represents the fourth generation of this popular compact SUV. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 181 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sportage for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common criticisms include its relatively small cargo area compared to competitors and some concerns about fuel economy, especially with the turbocharged engine.
