**Introduction:**

The 2018 Kia Sportage is a compact crossover SUV available with three engine options: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, and a 2.0-liter diesel four-cylinder. The 2.4-liter engine produces 181 horsepower and 175 pound-feet of torque, while the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine produces 240 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. The diesel engine produces 185 horsepower and 291 pound-feet of torque. All engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.

Owners of the 2018 Kia Sportage generally praise its practicality, comfortable interior, and value for money. However, there have been some reported issues with the vehicle, which are detailed below:

**Engine**

**2.4-liter Four-Cylinder**

* **Intake Valve Deposits:** Carbon buildup on the intake valves can cause a loss of power and fuel economy. The solution is to clean the valves, which typically costs between $200 - $300.
* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Faulty fuel injectors can lead to engine misfires, rough idling, and poor fuel economy. Replacement of the fuel injectors typically costs between $400 - $600.
* **Knock Sensor Failure:** A faulty knock sensor can cause the engine to run poorly and may lead to engine damage. Replacement of the knock sensor typically costs between $100 - $200.

**2.0-liter Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** Early models of the 2018 Sportage equipped with the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine experienced turbocharger failures. Kia issued a recall (NHTSA Campaign ID: 18V501000) to replace the affected turbochargers.
* **Oil Consumption:** Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption in the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. The solution is to monitor oil levels regularly and top up as needed.
* **Piston Ring Failure:** In rare cases, the piston rings in the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine can fail, causing a loss of compression and engine damage. Replacement of the piston rings typically costs between $2,000 - $3,000.

**2.0-liter Diesel Four-Cylinder**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging:** The DPF can become clogged with soot over time, which can lead to a loss of power and fuel efficiency. The solution is to clean or replace the DPF, which typically costs between $1,000 - $1,500.
* **EGR Valve Failure:** A faulty EGR valve can cause a loss of power and fuel economy. Replacement of the EGR valve typically costs between $300 - $500.
* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Faulty fuel injectors can lead to engine misfires, rough idling, and poor fuel economy. Replacement of the fuel injectors typically costs between $400 - $600.

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Issues:** Some owners have reported hard or delayed shifting in the six-speed automatic transmission. The solution is to have the transmission fluid flushed and new filters installed, which typically costs between $100 - $200.
* **Transmission Failure:** In rare cases, the six-speed automatic transmission can fail completely. Replacement of the transmission typically costs between $2,000 - $4,000.

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Failure:** The strut mounts can wear out over time, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps. Replacement of the strut mounts typically costs between $200 - $400.
* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure:** The rear shock absorbers can fail, leading to a loss of stability and handling. Replacement of the rear shock absorbers typically costs between $300 - $500.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge:** Some owners have reported that the battery discharges quickly when the vehicle is parked. The solution is to test the battery and replace it if necessary, which typically costs between $100 - $200.
* **Electrical Harness Issues:** There have been reports of electrical harness issues that can cause a variety of electrical problems, such as flickering lights, power window failures, and engine stalling. The solution is to repair or replace the affected harness, which can cost anywhere from $200 to over $1,000 depending on the extent of the problem.

**Exterior**

* **Roof Rack Issues:** The roof rack on some models of the 2018 Sportage can become loose or detached. The solution is to have the roof rack inspected and repaired or replaced by a qualified mechanic.
* **Tailgate Panel Rusting:** Some owners have reported that the tailgate panel on their Sportage has rusted prematurely. The solution is to have the tailgate panel replaced, which can cost anywhere from $500 to over $1,000 depending on the severity of the rust damage.

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system in some models of the 2018 Sportage can malfunction, causing the temperature to fluctuate or the air conditioning to not work properly. The solution is to diagnose and repair the faulty component, which can cost anywhere from $200 to over $1,000 depending on the problem.
* **Steering Wheel Noise:** The steering wheel on some models of the 2018 Sportage can make a creaking or rattling noise when it is turned. The solution is to lubricate the steering column, which typically costs between $50 - $100.

**Summary**

Overall, the 2018 Kia Sportage is a reliable and well-regarded vehicle. However, there have been some reported issues, particularly with the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and the electrical system. The severity of these issues varies, and most can be fixed for a relatively low cost.
