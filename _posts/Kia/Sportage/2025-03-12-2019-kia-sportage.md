The 2019 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, user-friendly technology, and strong warranty. It came with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 181 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 generating 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Sportage's value for money and spacious interior, but some dislike its fuel economy and somewhat bland styling.
