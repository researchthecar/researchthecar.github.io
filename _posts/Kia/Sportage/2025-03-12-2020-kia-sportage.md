The 2020 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV known for its comfortable ride, user-friendly technology, and spacious cabin. It generally receives positive reviews for its value and warranty. However, some drivers find the base engine to be underpowered and the fuel economy to be less competitive than some rivals. The 2020 Sportage offered two engine options: a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 181 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 237 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
