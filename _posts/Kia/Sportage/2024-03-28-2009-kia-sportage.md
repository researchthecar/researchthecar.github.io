**2009 Kia Sportage**

The 2009 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV available with either a 2.0L 4-cylinder engine producing 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque or a 2.7L V6 engine producing 173 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Sportage offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and plenty of safety features. However, it has received criticism for its lack of power, especially with the 4-cylinder engine, and its unremarkable fuel economy.
