**Introduction to the 2016 Kia Sportage**

The 2016 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable and well-equipped interior, along with a choice of two engine options and two transmission options. The base LX and EX trims are powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 181 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque, while the SX Turbo trim receives a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that generates 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission.

Owners of the 2016 Kia Sportage generally praise the vehicle for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong performance from the turbocharged engine.
