The 2014 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and available features. Engine options include a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 generating 260 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Sportage's value and warranty, but some common complaints include lackluster fuel economy (particularly with the turbo engine) and the potential for certain mechanical issues as the vehicle ages.
