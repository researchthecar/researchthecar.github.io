The 2001 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capability, especially considering its price point. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 130 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Turbo Diesel inline-4 cylinder engine. It came with a 5-speed manual transmission and a 4-speed automatic transmission as options. Some owners appreciate its compact size for city driving and its four-wheel-drive capability. Common complaints revolve around its dated styling, relatively low power output, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2001 Kia Sportage, while affordable, has several common issues stemming from its age and design. Engine problems like rough idling and oil leaks, coupled with transmission issues such as slipping gears, can lead to moderate to high repair costs. Suspension wear, electrical malfunctions, and rust are also prevalent concerns. Owners should carefully inspect these areas when considering purchasing this vehicle and factor potential repair costs into their budget. While many issues are manageable and relatively inexpensive to fix, significant engine or transmission problems can be costly and may make the vehicle less desirable as a reliable daily driver.
