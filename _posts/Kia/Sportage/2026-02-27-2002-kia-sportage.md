### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Kia Sportage, while a capable compact SUV, exhibits common issues for its age, particularly concerning the engine (head gaskets on the 2.0L, timing belt on 2.7L) and transmission (automatic slipping). Suspension components like ball joints and struts are also prone to wear. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and window regulators are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on climate. Interior wear, especially on upholstery and HVAC components, is also frequently reported. Regular maintenance and addressing these potential problems proactively are key to maintaining the Sportage's reliability.
