The 2007 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV that offered practicality and affordability. Available engines included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque and a 2.7L V6 that produced 173 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Sportage for its price point, maneuverability, and available all-wheel drive. Common complaints included lackluster fuel economy, a somewhat cheap interior feel, and unrefined engine performance.

**Summary**

The 2007 Kia Sportage can present owners with various issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical problems to more significant engine and transmission concerns. Engine oil leaks and timing belt issues (on the V6) are common, and the 4-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting problems. Suspension wear and tear, along with electrical issues such as power window and door lock failures, are also frequently reported. Rust can be a problem in certain climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, engine or transmission work can be costly. Buyers should inspect vehicles carefully, looking for signs of leaks, rust, and suspension wear, and inquire about the maintenance history, especially regarding the timing belt replacement on V6 models.
