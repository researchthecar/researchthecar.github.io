The 2002 Kia Sportage is a compact SUV known for its affordability and off-road capability. The Sportage came standard with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, producing around 130 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission was standard, with a 4-speed automatic transmission available as an option. Owners generally appreciate the Sportage's low price point and relatively simple mechanics, making it easier to work on compared to more modern vehicles. Common complaints include its lackluster fuel economy and somewhat dated interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Four-Cylinder**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.0L engine uses a timing belt. If not replaced according to the maintenance schedule (typically every 60,000 miles), the belt can break. A broken timing belt can cause catastrophic engine damage, including bent valves and damaged pistons.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended interval. If the timing belt has already broken, the engine may need significant repairs or even replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Timing belt replacement: $300-$500. Engine repair after timing belt failure: $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common from various seals and gaskets in the engine, most often the valve cover gasket or the oil pan gasket.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Thoroughly clean the engine afterwards to monitor for further leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket: $100 - $200. Oil pan gasket: $200 - $400.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can develop issues with erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush can sometimes resolve minor issues. However, often a transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission flush: $150-$300. Transmission rebuild: $1,500 - $3,000. Transmission replacement: $2,000 - $4,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front suspension components, specifically ball joints and tie rod ends, are prone to wear. Symptoms include clunking noises over bumps, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends. An alignment is required after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Ball joint replacement: $200 - $400 per side. Tie rod end replacement: $150 - $300 per side. Alignment: $100-$150.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working due to a failed window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**

**Summary**

The 2002 Kia Sportage, while affordable, can present several common issues as it ages. Engine issues such as timing belt failure and oil leaks can lead to costly repairs. Transmission problems like erratic shifting in the automatic transmission require immediate attention. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rod ends also require attention. Rust is another pervasive issue. Most of the issues are fairly common and generally inexpensive to repair; however, if left unresolved, could lead to major repair costs.
