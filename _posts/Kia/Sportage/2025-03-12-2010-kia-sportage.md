The 2010 Kia Sportage marked a significant redesign of the compact SUV, offering a more stylish and modern aesthetic than its predecessor. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual (only available on the 2.0L engine) and a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Sportage's attractive styling, comfortable ride, and value for the money. Common dislikes included underwhelming fuel economy for the class, some reports of reliability issues, and limited cargo space compared to rivals.
