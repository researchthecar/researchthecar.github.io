The 2006 Kia Sedona is a minivan that offers a spacious interior, comfortable ride, and a good value for its price. It was available with a single engine option: a 3.8L Lambda V6 producing 244 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People often liked the Sedona for its affordability, passenger room, and features for the price. Common dislikes included mediocre fuel economy, some reliability concerns, and a somewhat dated interior design compared to competitors.
