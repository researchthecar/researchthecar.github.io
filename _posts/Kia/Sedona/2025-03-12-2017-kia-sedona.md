The 2017 Kia Sedona is a minivan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly features. It offers a compelling value proposition for families needing a reliable people-mover. The 2017 Sedona is equipped with a 3.3-liter V6 engine producing 276 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sedona's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample cargo space. Some common criticisms include the rather uninspired styling and the fuel economy that is only average for the minivan segment.

**Engine**

**3.3L V6**
*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving, particularly at lower speeds or when idling. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: A software update to the Engine Control Unit (ECU) may be necessary to correct the fuel trim. In some cases, replacement of the Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) has resolved the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets and oil pan gasket. Visible oil drips underneath the vehicle or the smell of burning oil can be indicators.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets. Proper cleaning of the affected area after the repair is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely.
    *   Solution: This issue is very complicated to diagnose as it can be a large list of things causing this problem, from worn piston rings to malfunctioning PCV valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. The transmission may also hesitate before engaging.
    *   Solution: A software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may improve shift quality. In some cases, a full transmission fluid change can help. If the problem persists, internal transmission components, such as valve body solenoids, may need to be inspected and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip out of gear or fail to engage the desired gear. This can occur at any speed and may be accompanied by unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Check and refill transmission fluid to the correct level. Severe slipping can lead to the replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn-out rear shock absorbers, sway bar links, or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors may fail to open or close properly. They might get stuck, make unusual noises, or refuse to respond to the remote or interior buttons.
    *   Solution: Check the sliding door motor, sensors, and wiring harness for damage or corrosion. Replacement of the motor or sensor may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle. This can be caused by a parasitic drain, where an electrical component continues to draw power even when the car is off.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and identify the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve testing various electrical components. Once identified, the faulty component should be replaced or repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or exhibit other software glitches. Bluetooth connectivity problems are also common.
    *   Solution: Perform a system reset or software update. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Failure**

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

In summary, the 2017 Kia Sedona can suffer from a number of issues that may vary in severity and cost to repair. Engine and transmission problems, while potentially costly, don't seem exceptionally widespread. Issues with the electrical system, particularly the sliding doors and infotainment system, and the suspension are also possible. Potential buyers should have any used Sedona thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic, paying particular attention to these potential trouble areas, to avoid unexpected repair costs.
