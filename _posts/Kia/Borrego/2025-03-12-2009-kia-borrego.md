The 2009 Kia Borrego, also known as the Mohave in some markets, was Kia's attempt to break into the mid-size SUV market with a body-on-frame design offering robust towing capacity and off-road capability. It was available with two engine options: a 3.8L V6 producing 276 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.6L V8 generating 337 horsepower and 323 lb-ft of torque. The V6 was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 used a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Borrego's spacious interior, towing capability, and value for money compared to other SUVs in its class. Common complaints include its relatively poor fuel economy, and some reliability concerns.
