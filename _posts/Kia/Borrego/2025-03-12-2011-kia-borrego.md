The 2011 Kia Borrego, also known as the Mohave in some markets, is a mid-size SUV that offered a blend of off-road capability and on-road comfort. Engine options included a 3.8-liter V6 engine producing 276 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 4.6-liter V8 engine delivering 337 horsepower and 323 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Borrego for its robust body-on-frame construction, ample cargo space, and towing capacity. However, common complaints revolve around fuel economy, some reliability issues, and limited availability of parts due to its relatively short production run.

**Summary:**

The 2011 Kia Borrego presents a mix of potential issues. The severity ranges from relatively minor electrical problems to more significant engine and transmission concerns. The cost of repairs can vary widely, with engine and transmission work potentially reaching several thousand dollars. Owners should be aware of the potential for timing chain issues in the V8 and suspension issues with the rear air suspension (if equipped). Due to the relatively short production run of this model, parts availability can be a challenge, potentially increasing repair costs.
