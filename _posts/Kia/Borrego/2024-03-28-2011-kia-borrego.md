The 2011 Kia Borrego is a mid-size SUV offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions: a 3.8L V6 producing 276 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission, and a 4.6L V8 producing 319 horsepower and 324 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Borrego was praised for its spacious interior, powerful engines, and comfortable ride, but criticized for its fuel economy and lack of modern features.
