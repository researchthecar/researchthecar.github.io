**Battery**

*   **Slow DC Fast Charging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of DC fast charging speeds being significantly slower than the advertised peak speeds (e.g., slower than 200kW instead of the advertised 230kW+). This issue seems to be more prevalent at some charging networks than others. Some owners report the car not reaching above 50-60kW.
    *   Solution: Kia and charging network providers are actively investigating potential causes which include software bugs, battery management system inconsistencies, and charging station compatibility issues. Some owners have reported improvements after software updates.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Mostly software related, so the cost should be covered under warranty or by software updates (free). If a hardware problem is found related to the DC charging system, it would likely be covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Software Glitches & Infotainment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various software glitches reported, including infotainment system freezes, unresponsive touchscreens, navigation errors, and occasional connectivity problems with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. Some experience issues with the digital key.
    *   Solution: Kia has been releasing over-the-air (OTA) software updates to address these issues. Dealership software updates are also available. Performing a system reset can sometimes temporarily resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Mostly software-related. Software updates should be covered under warranty or provided free of charge. More extensive hardware problems would likely be covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of ADAS features (e.g., lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control) malfunctioning or behaving erratically. This includes false alerts, unexpected braking, or inconsistent lane centering.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the primary solution. Calibration of the ADAS sensors may be required. Some owners are instructed to restart the vehicle.
