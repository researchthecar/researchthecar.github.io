The 2015 Kia Soul is a compact hatchback known for its quirky design, spacious interior, and value proposition. It comes with two engine options: a 1.6-liter GDI four-cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 118 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0-liter GDI four-cylinder engine producing 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, depending on the trim level. Owners generally like the Soul's distinctive styling, ample cargo space, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include lackluster acceleration with the base engine, especially when fully loaded, and less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to some competitors. Some owners also wish for more advanced safety features, which were not as prevalent in this model year.

**Summary**

The 2015 Kia Soul, while offering a distinctive design and practical interior, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, such as knocking and oil consumption, appear to be significant concerns, particularly with both engine options. Transmission issues, although less frequent, can also be costly to repair. Electrical and suspension problems are relatively common and should be inspected before purchase. Overall, while many Souls provide reliable service, a thorough inspection, service history review, and potential pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended, especially considering the potential for expensive engine repairs.
