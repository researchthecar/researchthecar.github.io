The 2023 Kia Soul is a quirky and practical subcompact SUV known for its distinctive boxy design and value proposition. The sole engine option is a 2.0-liter inline-four cylinder engine producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People often praise the Soul for its spacious interior, user-friendly technology, and affordable price. Common complaints include the engine feeling underpowered, especially when fully loaded, and the CVT transmission sometimes exhibiting sluggish responsiveness.

**Summary:**

The 2023 Kia Soul experiences a range of issues, from minor interior rattles to potentially more significant problems with the transmission and AEB. Engine oil consumption is also a concern. The cost to address these issues can range from relatively inexpensive software updates to more substantial expenses such as CVT or AEB system replacements. While some issues are relatively common across vehicles in this class, potential buyers should be aware of the potential for these problems and factor them into their purchase decision.
