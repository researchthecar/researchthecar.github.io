The 2019 Kia Soul is a quirky and practical compact hatchback known for its distinctive boxy design and spacious interior. The base engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 161 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The top trim, the Exclaim (!), has a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine, producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners appreciate the Soul's affordability, generous warranty, user-friendly infotainment system, and cargo capacity. Common complaints include the fuel economy not living up to the promised MPG, some wind noise at higher speeds, and the base engine can feel underpowered.
