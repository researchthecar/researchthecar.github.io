The 2012 Kia Soul is a compact, boxy hatchback known for its distinctive styling, spacious interior, and affordability. It was available with two engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-4 producing 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0-liter inline-4 generating 164 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners generally appreciate the Soul's unique design, practicality, and value. Common complaints include a somewhat noisy ride, limited cargo space, and occasionally reported issues with engine and electrical components.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Knocking/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine knocking noises, loss of power, and in some cases, complete engine failure. This is often attributed to premature wear of connecting rod bearings. Symptoms can range from a subtle knocking sound at idle to a loud, consistent knocking sound during acceleration, accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: In severe cases, engine replacement is necessary. Less severe cases may be resolved by replacing the affected bearings, but this requires careful inspection and diagnosis by a qualified mechanic.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for engine replacement. $1,500 - $3,000+ for bearing replacement (labor intensive).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, rattling sounds from under the car, and a sulfur smell. The check engine light will likely illuminate with codes related to catalytic converter inefficiency (P0420).
    * Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can be due to worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, options range from using a thicker oil to replacing piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test can help diagnose the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (valve stem seals), $2000 - $4000+ (piston rings).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 1.6L engine, some owners have reported engine knocking noises, loss of power, and in some cases, complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: In severe cases, engine replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for engine replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**
* No Issues Found

**6-Speed Automatic**
*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. Slipping between gears or a delay in engagement can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid may alleviate minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission overhaul or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid change, $500 - $1500 for valve body repair, $2500 - $5000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Often attributed to worn or loose sway bar links, bushings, or shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per component for sway bar links or bushings, $200 - $500 per shock absorber (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, causing difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a period of time. This can be due to a parasitic drain from a faulty component or an aging battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the source of the parasitic drain and repair or replacement of the faulty component. Battery replacement may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for battery replacement, $100 - $500+ for diagnosing and repairing parasitic drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Power Windows/Locks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows or door locks. This can be due to a faulty switch, motor, or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty component and repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per window or lock, depending on the component needing repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the rear hatch. The latch mechanism may become stiff or fail completely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear hatch latch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the only permanent solution, but is costly. Dashboard covers are a less expensive alternative to mask the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ for dashboard replacement, $50 - $200 for dashboard cover.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to pair devices, frequent disconnections, or poor audio quality during calls or music streaming.
    *   Solution: Attempting to update the head unit's software might fix the issue. If not, replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for aftermarket head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2012 Kia Soul, while generally reliable, has some common issues. The most concerning are engine-related, particularly potential engine knocking and failure, with potentially high repair costs. Transmission issues, electrical problems, and suspension noises are also relatively common. While some issues are minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, potentially impacting the overall ownership experience.
