The 2014 Kia Soul is a compact hatchback known for its funky styling, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. It was offered with two engine choices: a 1.6-liter GDI four-cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 118 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter NU four-cylinder engine generating 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Soul's unique design, practicality, and value, but some find its ride quality a bit stiff and its fuel economy not class-leading.
