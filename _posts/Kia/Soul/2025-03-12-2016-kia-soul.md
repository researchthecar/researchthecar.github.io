The 2016 Kia Soul is a quirky and practical compact hatchback known for its distinctive boxy design and spacious interior. It offers a comfortable ride and a good amount of features for its price point. The 2016 Kia Soul came with a few engine options. The base model is powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 118 lb-ft of torque. An available upgrade is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. For the 2016 model year, the 1.6-liter engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0-liter engine was exclusively paired with the 6-speed automatic transmission. People like the Soul for its unique styling, roomy cabin, and user-friendly technology. Some common complaints include mediocre fuel economy (especially with the 2.0L engine), and the base engine's lack of power for highway driving.
