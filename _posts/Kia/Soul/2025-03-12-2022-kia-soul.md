The 2022 Kia Soul is a popular subcompact SUV known for its distinctive boxy styling, spacious interior, and affordable price. The base engine for the 2022 model year is a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 cylinder engine producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with an Intelligent Variable Transmission (IVT). There are no other engine or transmission options. People generally like the Soul's quirky design, practicality, and value. Common dislikes include the lack of available all-wheel drive, the sometimes-underwhelming performance of the base engine, and road noise.
