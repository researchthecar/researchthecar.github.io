The 2021 Kia Soul is a popular subcompact SUV known for its distinctive boxy design, spacious interior, and affordable price point. It comes with two engine options: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). People generally like the Soul for its practicality, unique styling, and value. Common dislikes include the base engine's somewhat sluggish acceleration and the DCT's occasional hesitation at low speeds.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder (CVT)**
*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine hesitating or stalling, particularly at low speeds or during acceleration. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with software updates to the engine control unit (ECU), cleaning the mass airflow sensor, or replacing the throttle body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**1.6L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (7-Speed DCT)**
    *  No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (paired with 2.0L engine)**
    *   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported jerking, hesitation, or rough shifting from the CVT. This can be more pronounced at lower speeds or when accelerating from a stop.
        *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) have resolved the issue in some cases. In more severe cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
        *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed DCT (paired with 1.6L Turbocharged Engine)**
    *   **DCT Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or jerky engagement, especially at low speeds or when starting from a stop. The transmission may also exhibit rough or delayed shifting.
        *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. In some cases, clutch replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary, though less common.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
        *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Noise/Premature Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps. This can be due to premature wear or failure of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Attempting a system reset or updating the software. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain causing issues such as the vehicle not starting.
    *   Solution: Some issues can be resolved with a software update to one of the vehicles modules. In other cases, the battery needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $300

**Summary**

The 2021 Kia Soul, while a popular and generally reliable vehicle, does have some common issues reported by owners. Engine hesitation and transmission issues (especially with the CVT and DCT) appear to be the most significant concerns, potentially leading to expensive repairs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain, as well as suspension noises and interior rattles, are also relatively common. While many issues can be resolved with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs, some may require more costly component replacements, such as the CVT, DCT, or infotainment unit. The overall severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially significant mechanical problems.
