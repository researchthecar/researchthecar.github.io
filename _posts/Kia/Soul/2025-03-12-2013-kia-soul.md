The 2013 Kia Soul is a compact, boxy hatchback known for its distinctive styling, practicality, and affordability. Engine options for the 2013 Soul include a 1.6-liter GDI four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0-liter Nu four-cylinder engine delivering 164 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Soul's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly features. However, some common complaints include limited cargo space, a somewhat noisy cabin, and potential reliability issues.
