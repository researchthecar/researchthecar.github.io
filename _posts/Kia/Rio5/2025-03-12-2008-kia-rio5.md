The 2008 Kia Rio5 is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It's powered by a 1.6-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 110 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It came with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its low price point and gas mileage, but common dislikes include its limited power, basic interior, and somewhat unrefined driving experience.
