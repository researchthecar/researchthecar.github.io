**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Cylinder (G4ED)**

*   **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine idles roughly, especially when cold, and may stall at idle or when decelerating. This is often accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly clean the throttle body and idle air control valve (if equipped). Replace the idle air control valve if cleaning doesn't resolve the issue. Check for vacuum leaks. If throttle body is damaged, it needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light - P0420 Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light is illuminated, and a code P0420 is stored, indicating the catalytic converter's efficiency has dropped below the required level. Symptoms may also include decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter. Before replacing, ensure that the oxygen sensors are functioning correctly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
