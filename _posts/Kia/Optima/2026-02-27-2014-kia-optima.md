### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Kia Optima generally presents a good reliability record, especially considering its competitive pricing and features. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the engines, particularly oil consumption in both the 2.4L and 2.0T variants, and potential carbon buildup. Transmission issues, while not rampant, can manifest as hesitation or shuddering. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components like strut mounts can develop noise over time. However, many owners experience trouble-free ownership with regular maintenance. Addressing potential oil consumption early is key to long-term engine health.
