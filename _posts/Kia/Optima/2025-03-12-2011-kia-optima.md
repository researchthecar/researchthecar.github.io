The 2011 Kia Optima marked a significant redesign, moving away from its previously bland styling and offering a more sporty and appealing sedan. Available with three engine choices, the base 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 cylinder (200 hp, 186 lb-ft torque), a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder (274 hp, 269 lb-ft torque), and a 2.4L hybrid inline-4 cylinder (166 hp, 154 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, except for the hybrid that used a hybrid-specific automatic transmission. Owners generally praised the 2011 Optima for its stylish design, fuel economy, and long warranty. However, some common complaints included engine issues, particularly with the early production years, electrical problems, and interior trim quality.
