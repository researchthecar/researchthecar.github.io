The 2008 Kia Optima is a mid-size sedan offering a balance of affordability and practicality. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 162 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L V6 engine producing around 185 horsepower and 182 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was generally paired with a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.7L engine was only available with the 5-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Optima for its spacious interior and extensive standard features for the price. Common criticisms included the engine's unremarkable performance and reports of various reliability concerns.
