The 2017 Kia Optima is a mid-size sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and generous features for the price. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 (185 hp, 178 lb-ft of torque), a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 (178 hp, 195 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (245 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque). The 2.4L and 2.0L engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L is paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners generally appreciate the Optima's value, fuel economy, and spacious interior, but some common complaints include engine issues, transmission hesitation (particularly with the DCT), and electrical glitches.
