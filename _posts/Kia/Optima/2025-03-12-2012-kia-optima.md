Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2012 Kia Optima, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2012 Kia Optima was a popular mid-size sedan known for its stylish design, fuel efficiency, and value. It was available with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 200 horsepower and 186 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 274 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L hybrid engine. All non-hybrid engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Common praises included the Optima's comfortable ride and feature-rich interior for the price. Criticisms often centered on the base engine's performance being adequate but not particularly exciting, and some reported issues with reliability.

**Summary**

The 2012 Kia Optima has some notable reliability concerns, particularly with the 2.4L GDI engine and the 2.0L Turbo, where engine failure due to connecting rod bearing issues is relatively common and costly to fix. Transmission issues can also occur. While other issues exist within the suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior, these are generally less severe and less expensive to repair than the engine or transmission problems. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used 2012 Optima before purchasing, paying close attention to engine noises and maintenance records. The recalls listed, while numerous, are important to verify have been addressed.
