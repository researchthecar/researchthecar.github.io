The 2010 Kia Optima, a mid-size sedan, offers a blend of affordability, practicality, and a surprisingly stylish design for its time. It came with two engine choices: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 175 horsepower and 169 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7-liter V6 generating 194 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, depending on the trim level. Owners generally appreciate the Optima's value for money, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with certain engine components, as well as some electrical gremlins.

**Summary**

The 2010 Kia Optima, while offering value and features, has some notable reliability concerns. The engine issues, particularly with the 2.4L inline-4, can be severe and costly. Transmission problems and suspension issues also contribute to the ownership experience. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to address, major repairs such as engine or transmission replacement can significantly increase the overall cost of ownership. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and carefully inspect any used Optima before purchase, paying close attention to engine noises, shifting quality, and suspension components.
