### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Kia Optima presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components are generally robust with diligent maintenance, owners should be prepared for potential issues related to oil leaks, particularly with the V6 engine, and timing belt maintenance on the 4-cylinder. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic, can be costly. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and alternators, are also noted. Overall, the Optima can be a dependable vehicle if common issues are addressed promptly, but it's not without its potential repair expenses.
