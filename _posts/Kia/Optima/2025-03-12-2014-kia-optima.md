The 2.4L and 2.0L turbo GDI engines have both been known to fail, mainly due to rod bearing issues. Other electrical issues can be frustrating but are usually less costly. While the potential for engine failure is a significant concern, many Optima owners experience few or no issues, making it important to thoroughly inspect any used model and check its maintenance history.
