The 2019 Kia Optima is a mid-size sedan known for its value, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It's available with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 (185 hp, 178 lb-ft of torque), a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 (178 hp, 195 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (245 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque). The 2.4L and 2.0L engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L is mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Optima's styling, features for the price, and fuel economy. Common dislikes include occasionally unrefined engine performance, particularly with the base 2.4L engine and some reports of transmission issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
* **Engine Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving, especially at low speeds or when idling. This can be intermittent and may or may not be accompanied by a check engine light.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause of stalling can be complex and might involve checking the fuel system, ignition system, or sensors. Some owners have reported that replacing the mass airflow sensor or throttle position sensor resolves the issue. Others have needed software updates to the ECU.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels between oil changes. This can cause engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Symptoms include the need to add oil frequently and potential engine knocking noises.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update to adjust oil consumption parameters has been implemented. If the problem persists, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $3,000+ (engine repair/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **No Issues Found**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.4L and 2.0L engines)**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Can also manifest as hesitation when accelerating.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush might help in some cases. In other instances, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may be required to improve shift quality. For more severe cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $1,500+ (valve body replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (Paired with 1.6L engine)**

* **Hesitation/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds, accompanied by jerky or uneven engagement of the clutch. This is a common characteristic of dual-clutch transmissions, but can be more pronounced in some cases.
    * Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may improve the responsiveness and smoothness of the transmission. In some instances, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (clutch replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or excessive battery drain, especially if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods.
    * Solution: Investigate potential parasitic drains by testing the current draw when the vehicle is off. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or issues with the infotainment system. Replacing the battery with a high-quality AGM battery may also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (battery replacement, diagnostic fees)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    * Solution: Try a soft reset of the infotainment system. If the problem persists, a software update from the dealer might be necessary. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (soft reset) - $1,000+ (infotainment system replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
