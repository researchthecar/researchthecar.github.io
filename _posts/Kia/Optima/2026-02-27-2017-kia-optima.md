### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Kia Optima presents a generally reliable option in the mid-size sedan segment. While not immune to issues, the most commonly reported problems are related to engine oil consumption in the 2.4L GDI, potential turbocharger issues in the 2.0L Turbo variant, and occasional transmission hesitation or jerky shifts, particularly with the DCT. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted but are not pervasive.

The overall cost of repairs for reported issues is moderate, with most common fixes being relatively affordable.
