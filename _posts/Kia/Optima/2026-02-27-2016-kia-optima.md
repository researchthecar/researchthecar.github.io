### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Kia Optima presents a generally reliable option in the mid-size sedan segment. The most frequently cited technical concerns revolve around the 2.4L GDI engine, specifically oil consumption and potential carbon buildup, which can impact performance and longevity if not addressed. The automatic transmissions, both the 6-speed and the 7-speed DCT, have occasionally been reported to exhibit rough shifting or hesitation, often resolvable with software updates. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. However, these issues are not universal, and many owners report a trouble-free experience. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging symptoms are recommended for optimal ownership.
