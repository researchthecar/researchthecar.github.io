The 2006 Kia Sorento is a mid-size SUV that was available with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 engine producing 192 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque and a larger 3.8L V6 producing 263 horsepower and 257 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Sorento for its affordability, spacious interior, and off-road capabilities, while common complaints revolved around fuel economy, some reliability issues, and a somewhat dated interior design.
