The 2021 Kia Sorento marked the beginning of the fourth generation of this popular mid-size SUV. It offered a more refined design, updated technology, and a broader range of powertrains. While generally well-received for its value, spacious interior, and user-friendly features, some owners have reported specific issues. The available engines for the 2021 Sorento include a 2.5L GDI 4-cylinder (191 hp, 181 lb-ft of torque), a 2.5L Turbo GDI 4-cylinder (281 hp, 311 lb-ft of torque), and a 1.6L Turbo GDI 4-cylinder hybrid powertrain (227 hp combined). A plug-in hybrid option was also available. Many owners appreciate the Sorento's stylish exterior, comfortable ride, and extensive safety features. Common dislikes include occasional transmission hesitation (especially with the DCT) and some complaints about the sensitivity of the advanced driver-assistance systems.
