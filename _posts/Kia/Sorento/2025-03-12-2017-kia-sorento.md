Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues reported by owners of the 2017 Kia Sorento, organized by component and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2017 Kia Sorento is a mid-size SUV that offers a comfortable ride and good value for the price.  It came with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 (185 hp, 178 lb-ft torque), a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (240 hp, 260 lb-ft torque), and a 3.3L V6 (290 hp, 252 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Sorento's spacious interior, user-friendly infotainment system, and available third-row seating. Common dislikes include the base engine's lackluster performance and some reported reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Knock/Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Owners have reported a noticeable knocking or ticking sound coming from the engine, particularly during cold starts or at idle. This can be a sign of excessive wear, low oil, or more serious internal engine issues. Some report rough idling and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a mechanic is crucial to determine the cause. The issue could require anything from a simple oil change to more complex repairs such as valve adjustments, or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, where the engine burns through oil at a rate faster than normal, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes.
    *   Solution:  Initially monitor oil levels frequently and add oil as needed. A mechanic can perform a leakdown test to assess the condition of the piston rings and valves. Potential fixes include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings, or in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden engine failure, often preceded by knocking or ticking sounds, reduced power, and potentially warning lights on the dashboard. Some owners report complete engine shutdown.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement or major engine rebuild. Proper diagnosis is crucial to determine the root cause of the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls:
        *   **Recall Number: SC200 (Engine Control Unit Software Logic Improvement)**: This recall addresses a potential issue where the Engine Control Unit (ECU) software logic could lead to engine damage.

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the turbocharger, reduced engine power, and potential check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the turbocharger to determine if it requires repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating or shifting gears. Slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be needed to check for valve body issues, worn clutches, or other internal damage. In some cases, transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission ceases to function properly, leading to inability to shift gears or move the vehicle. Often preceded by slipping, harsh shifting, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. This can be due to worn-out shocks, struts, or sway bar links.
    * Solution: Inspection of the rear suspension components, followed by replacement of worn parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the parts needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The battery drains quickly, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a while.  This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty module, a bad alternator, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution:  Have a mechanic perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Replace the faulty module, alternator, or battery as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, glitches, or reboots unexpectedly.  Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation errors, and unresponsive touchscreens are also reported.
    *   Solution:  Try resetting the system to factory defaults. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be reprogrammed or replaced.
