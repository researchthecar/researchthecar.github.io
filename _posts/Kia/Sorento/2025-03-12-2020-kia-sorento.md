The 2020 Kia Sorento is a mid-size SUV offering a blend of practicality and value. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.3L V6 generating 290 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.3L V6 utilizes an 8-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the Sorento's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some criticisms include the base engine's lack of power and reported issues with certain components, particularly in earlier production models.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the 2.4L engine stalling unexpectedly, particularly at lower speeds or while idling. In more severe cases, engine failure has occurred, often attributed to connecting rod bearing failure. Ticking or knocking noises from the engine may precede the stalling or failure.
    *   Solution: The most common solution involves replacing the entire engine assembly. Some owners have reported success with short block replacements, though this is less common. In some cases, a software update may be applied to address engine knock detection sensitivity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $8,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls:
        *   SC188 (Certain 2011-2014 Kia Sorento, Optima, and Sportage vehicles): This recall addresses a potential fire hazard due to engine oil leaking onto hot exhaust components. It may not directly relate to engine failure, but it's relevant to overall engine safety.
        *   SC217 (Certain 2015-2017 Kia Sorento vehicles): This recall relates to a potential engine compartment fire caused by a fuel leak.
        *   SC220 (Certain 2016-2018 Kia Sorento vehicles): This recall covers piston ring damage that can cause engine stalling.
