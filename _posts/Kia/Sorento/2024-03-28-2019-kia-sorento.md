**Introduction to the 2019 Kia Sorento**

The 2019 Kia Sorento is a midsize SUV that offers a spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and a variety of engine and transmission options. It is powered by a standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. A 3.3-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque is optional. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Sorento is a popular choice for families and those who need a versatile SUV. It has received praise for its comfortable interior, user-friendly infotainment system, and affordable price.
