The 2005 Kia Sorento is a mid-size SUV that offers a balance of affordability and practicality. Engine options included a 3.5-liter V6 producing 192 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5L V6 with 200 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sorento for its spacious interior and off-road capabilities. Common criticisms include mediocre fuel economy and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**
