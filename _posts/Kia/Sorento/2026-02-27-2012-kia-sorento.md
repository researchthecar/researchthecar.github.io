### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Kia Sorento presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.4L GDI engine has known issues with knocking and oil consumption, which can be significant. The 6-speed automatic transmission may experience shifting problems. Suspension components like struts and sway bar links can wear out, leading to ride quality issues. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are also reported. Exterior paint and interior components like the HVAC blower motor and infotainment system can also be sources of concern. While the 3.5L V6 engine appears more robust, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
