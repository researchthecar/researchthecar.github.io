    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming an excessive amount of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and illuminated oil pressure warning lights.
    *   Solution: Kia has issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) regarding this issue. The solution often involves performing an oil consumption test to determine the severity. In some cases, a software update to the Engine Control Unit (ECU) can help. In more severe cases, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
