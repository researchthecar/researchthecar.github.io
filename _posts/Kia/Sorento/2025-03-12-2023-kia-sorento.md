The 2023 Kia Sorento is a popular mid-size SUV known for its stylish design, spacious interior, and value. The Sorento comes with a few different powertrain options. The base engine is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder is also available, delivering 281 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque. This engine is mated to an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Additionally, a hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrain are available. Owners often praise the Sorento for its comfortable ride, user-friendly technology, and abundant safety features. Some common dislikes include the base engine's performance feeling underpowered, and some find the third-row seating best suited for children.
