The 2004 Kia Sorento marked Kia's entry into the mid-size SUV market. It generally received positive initial reviews for its value proposition, offering a robust set of features at a competitive price. Owners appreciated its off-road capability and relatively spacious interior. However, common complaints included relatively poor fuel economy, some reported reliability issues, and a somewhat dated interior compared to competitors. Engine options included a 3.5L V6 engine and a 2.4L I4 engine. The 3.5L produced approximately 192 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual transmission, depending on the engine.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can fail prematurely, leading to catastrophic engine damage if it breaks while the engine is running. Symptoms may include ticking noises, rough running, or a complete engine stall.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended service interval (typically every 60,000-90,000 miles). Also replace the water pump and tensioner pulley at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (depending on damage if belt breaks).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor may fail, causing the engine to stall or fail to start. The check engine light will likely illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L I4**
* **Cylinder Head Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L I4 can suffer from cracked cylinder heads causing coolant and oil to mix. Symptoms include milky oil, overheating, and white smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000
    * Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (Specifically A4CF1)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear, or transmission slipping under load.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the issue. Could be a bad transmission filter, low fluid, a bad shift solenoid, or more severe internal damage to the transmission that can be fixed by replacing friction plates and seals. May require a transmission rebuild or replacement if the damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can lead to shuddering, stalling, or complete loss of power. Often accompanied by unusual noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.

**Summary**

The 2004 Kia Sorento, while offering value and capability, has demonstrated several common issues. Engine problems, particularly timing belt failure on the V6, can be very expensive to repair. Transmission issues, specifically with the 4-speed automatic, are prevalent and may require costly repairs or replacement. Suspension components, like ball joints and shocks, tend to wear prematurely, necessitating replacements. Electrical and interior issues, while less critical, contribute to overall ownership costs. Rust is a significant concern in certain climates, and addressing it can become costly. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and budget for potential repairs.
