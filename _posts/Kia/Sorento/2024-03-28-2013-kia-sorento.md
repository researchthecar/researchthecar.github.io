**Introduction to the 2013 Kia Sorento**

The 2013 Kia Sorento is a midsize SUV that offers both a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It is available with a choice of two engines: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that produces 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.3-liter V6 that generates 290 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Sorento is praised for its roomy cabin, user-friendly infotainment system, and affordable price. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as a lack of power with the four-cylinder engine and a firm suspension that can lead to a rough ride on bumpy roads.
