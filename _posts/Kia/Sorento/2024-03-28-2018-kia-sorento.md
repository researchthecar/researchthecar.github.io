**Introduction:**

The 2018 Kia Sorento is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, impressive safety features, and value for money. It comes with a choice of two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 and a 3.3L V6. The 2.4L engine produces 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.3L engine generates 290 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 6-speed automatic or 8-speed automatic transmission.

While the Sorento is generally a reliable SUV, some owners have experienced specific issues with certain components.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Engine Oil Leak:** Leaks may occur from the oil pan gasket or valve cover gasket. Symptoms include low oil levels, visible oil leaks, and a burning oil smell. The solution involves replacing the faulty gasket, costing approximately $200 - $400+.
* **Timing Chain Noise:** Some engines may develop a rattling or whining noise caused by a stretched timing chain. Replacing the timing chain and related components typically costs $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Knocking Noise:** Knocking sounds can indicate engine bearing issues. Repair involves replacing the affected bearings, costing around $1,000 - $1,500+.

**3.3L V6**

* **Valve Train Noise:** Tapping or ticking noises may be caused by worn or defective valve lifters. Replacing the lifters costs approximately $400 - $800+.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** Vehicles may experience hesitation or slippage during gear changes. The issue often results from worn clutch packs and requires transmission rebuild or replacement, costing $2,000 - $4,000+.

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Hesitation:** Delays or hesitation during gear changes may occur due to software issues or transmission control module (TCM) problems. Software updates or replacement of the TCM typically resolves the issue, costing $200 - $600+.
