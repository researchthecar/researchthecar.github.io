The 2007 Kia Sorento is a mid-size SUV that offered a comfortable ride and a decent amount of space for its class. Engine options included a 3.3L V6 engine producing 242 horsepower and 228 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 engine producing 263 horsepower and 257 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sorento's value for the money and its off-road capability, but some common complaints include mediocre fuel economy and some reliability concerns.
