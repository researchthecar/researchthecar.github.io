The 2011 Kia Sorento was a significant redesign, marking a shift to a more modern and car-like unibody construction. It was available with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 175 horsepower and 169 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 engine producing around 276 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, and later in the model year a turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 engine was added. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Sorento's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and attractive styling. Common complaints often revolved around fuel economy (particularly with the V6), some reliability issues, and the sometimes-stiff ride quality of certain trim levels with larger wheels.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Knocking/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine noise, often described as knocking or tapping, eventually leading to engine failure. This is often associated with connecting rod bearing failure.
    *   Solution: Complete engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: 17V-024, 16V-927

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rapid decrease in oil levels between oil changes, potentially leading to engine damage. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be present.
    *   Solution: Typically requires piston ring replacement or engine replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Kia Sorento, particularly those equipped with the 2.4L engine, can suffer from significant engine issues, including engine knocking and failure, leading to potentially high repair costs. Transmission problems, suspension issues, and electrical gremlins can also add to the ownership experience. The 2.4L engine is the most reported with major problems while the 3.5L has fewer problems. While some issues may be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as engine replacement, can be a major financial burden. Potential buyers should carefully inspect vehicles and review service records before purchasing, especially models with the 2.4L engine.
