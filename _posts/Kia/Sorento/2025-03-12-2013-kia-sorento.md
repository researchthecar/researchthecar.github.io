Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2013 Kia Sorento, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration as requested. The 2013 Kia Sorento is a mid-size SUV that offers a blend of value and practicality. It was offered with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 191 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 engine producing 276 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 260 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sorento's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and extensive features for the price. Common complaints include less-than-stellar fuel economy (especially with the V6), some reliability concerns, and a somewhat unrefined driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Knocking/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of engine knocking noises, often leading to complete engine failure. This issue seems to be related to connecting rod bearing failure due to oil sludge buildup or manufacturing defects. Some owners report this occurring at relatively low mileage.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement is often required. Some owners have had success with warranty claims or goodwill assistance from Kia, especially if they have documented maintenance records.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls:
        *   SC147 (Service Campaign) - PI1802 - Inspect the Engine Assembly and Perform Knock Sensor Detection System (KSDS) Software Logic Upgrade
        *   SC176 (Service Campaign) - PI2002 - Replace the Engine Assembly with a New Engine Assembly

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming excessive amounts of oil between oil changes, sometimes requiring adding oil every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored and addressed.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include piston ring replacement or engine replacement. A compression test can help diagnose the severity of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+

**Summary**

The 2013 Kia Sorento, while offering good value, has some notable issues. The 2.4L engine is particularly prone to engine knocking/failure and excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. Transmission problems such as rough shifting are also prevalent. Other issues such as suspension sagging and electrical glitches may also be encountered.
