The 2009 Kia Sorento is a mid-size SUV known for its affordability and practicality. It came with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 175 horsepower and 169 lb-ft of torque, a 3.3L V6 engine producing around 242 horsepower and 228 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 engine producing around 263 horsepower and 256 lb-ft of torque. The transmissions available were a 5-speed manual (only with the 2.4L), a 5-speed automatic, and a 5-speed sportmatic automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Sorento's value for money, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include its fuel economy (particularly with the V6 engines), some cheap interior materials, and its somewhat unrefined driving dynamics compared to some competitors.
