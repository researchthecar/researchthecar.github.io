The 2016 Kia Sorento is a mid-size SUV that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It came with three engine options: a 2.4L Inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 making 240 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 delivering 290 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sorento's value, smooth ride, and available features. However, some common complaints include issues with engine stalling, electrical glitches, and some transmission hesitation.
