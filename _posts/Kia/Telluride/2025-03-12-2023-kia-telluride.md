The 2023 Kia Telluride is a popular mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and long list of standard features. It's powered by a 3.8-liter Lambda II V6 engine producing 291 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally praise the Telluride for its value, upscale interior, and user-friendly technology. Criticisms often include its fuel economy, somewhat firm ride, and limited off-road capability. Let's examine the common issues reported by 2023 Kia Telluride owners, categorized by major components.

**Engine**

**3.8L Lambda II V6**

*   **Engine Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The rate of consumption varies but can be as high as a quart every 1,000-3,000 miles. Blue smoke from the exhaust pipe is sometimes seen.
    *   Solution: A dealer performed oil consumption test is recommended to verify the severity of the issue. A failing PCV valve can be an early cause of oil consumption that is simple to remedy. Depending on the results, possible repairs include piston ring replacement, valve seal replacement, or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (PCV Valve), $3,000 - $7,000+ (Engine Repair/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine ticking/knocking noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported an audible ticking or knocking noise coming from the engine, particularly at idle or low speeds. This can be due to a variety of reasons, including noisy fuel injectors, lifters, or potentially more serious internal engine issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose source of noise through visual inspection and diagnostic tools. Repair or replace the part that is the root cause of the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifts, particularly when shifting between gears at low speeds or when accelerating. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or hesitation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: The first step is often a transmission control module (TCM) software update to address any programming glitches. In some cases, flushing the transmission and replacing the fluid can help. If the problem persists, it could indicate a more serious issue with the valve body, solenoids, or internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Software Update/Fluid Change), $500 - $2,000+ (Valve Body/Solenoid Repair/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced the transmission slipping, especially during acceleration or uphill driving. This feels like the engine is revving without a corresponding increase in speed, and the transmission might struggle to find the correct gear.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. Low fluid or contaminated fluid can cause slipping. A transmission flush and fluid replacement may resolve the issue. If slipping persists, internal damage to the clutches or other components may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (Fluid Check/Change), $3,000 - $7,000+ (Transmission Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly over bumps or uneven surfaces. These noises can range from clunks and rattles to creaks and squeaks.
    *   Solution: Inspect suspension components such as sway bar links, bushings, shocks, and struts for wear or damage. Replacing worn bushings or links is a common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the infotainment system freezing, lagging, or randomly rebooting. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Try performing a soft reset of the infotainment system. Check for software updates and install the latest version. If the issue persists, a dealer visit may be required to diagnose and potentially replace the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update), $500 - $2,000+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **"Check Engine" Light Illumination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "Check Engine" light illuminating on the dashboard for various reasons. This can be triggered by anything from a loose gas cap to a more serious engine or emissions system problem.
    *   Solution: Have the vehicle scanned for diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) using an OBD-II scanner. This will help pinpoint the source of the problem. Then, address the underlying issue based on the DTCs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the vehicle's battery draining overnight or within a few days of non-use.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested to ensure it's in good condition. Check for parasitic drains by using a multimeter to measure current draw when the vehicle is off. Identify the source of the drain (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory) and repair or disconnect it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Battery Replacement), $100 - $500+ (Parasitic Drain Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported the automatic tailgate failing to open or close properly. It may get stuck, open partially, or make unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Inspect the tailgate struts, sensors, and motor for any signs of damage or obstruction. Resetting the tailgate system can sometimes resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the struts or motor may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power seat motors fail, causing the seats to become inoperable or move erratically.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty seat motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported the sunroof/moonroof getting stuck, making excessive noise, or leaking.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sunroof tracks and seals for debris or damage. Lubricate the tracks. If the problem persists, the sunroof motor or mechanism may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
