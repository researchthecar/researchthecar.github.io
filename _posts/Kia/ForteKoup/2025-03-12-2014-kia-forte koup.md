The 2014 Kia Forte Koup is a sporty two-door compact car that offered a blend of style and value. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque and a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 generating 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Koup's attractive styling, comfortable ride, and long warranty. Common dislikes include the somewhat unrefined engine noise and the base engine's lack of responsiveness compared to competitors.

**Summary**

The 2014 Kia Forte Koup has a range of potential issues, with engine and transmission concerns being among the most significant. The 1.6L turbo engine may suffer from turbocharger failure, and the automatic transmission can experience rough shifting.

While the Koup is generally a reliable car, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have a mechanic inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
