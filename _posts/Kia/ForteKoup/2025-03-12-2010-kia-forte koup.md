Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 156 horsepower and 144 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter inline-4 generating 173 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (available on the 2.4L), and a 4-speed automatic (2.0L) or 5-speed automatic (2.4L). Owners appreciate its value and fuel economy but sometimes critique its ride quality and some interior materials.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A knocking or pinging sound from the engine, especially during acceleration or under load. May be caused by carbon buildup, low-quality fuel, or issues with the knock sensor.
    *   Solution: Using higher-octane fuel, cleaning the fuel system, or replacing the knock sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the cause and repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes a significant amount of oil between oil changes, requiring frequent top-offs. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause (e.g., worn piston rings, valve stem seals) and repairing or replacing the affected components. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the cause and repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (2.0L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between gears. Transmission may slip during acceleration or fail to engage properly.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, internal transmission damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush/filter), $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (2.4L)**

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay when shifting into drive or reverse. The transmission may take a few seconds to engage, which is often more noticeable when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the transmission fluid and filter. Internal issues might require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush/filter), $500 - $2500+ (valve body/rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during turns, and decreased handling stability. Visible signs of wear, such as leaking fluid, may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shocks. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Torsion Beam Bushings Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can also cause vague handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the torsion beam bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window operates slowly, intermittently, or not at all. Grinding or clicking noises may be heard when attempting to operate the window.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock fails to lock or unlock, either manually or with the key fob.
    *   Solution: Replacing the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulation inside the headlight housing, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs/electrical components.
    *   Solution: Sealing the headlight housing or replacing the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (sealing), $200 - $500+ (replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Illumination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light on the dashboard illuminates, indicating a potential problem with the airbag system. This requires immediate attention as it can affect the functionality of the airbags in an accident.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the issue with an OBD II scanner that can read airbag codes. Common issues are related to the clockspring or seat position sensors. After the repair, the codes must be cleared.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
