The 2017 Kia Forte Koup is a sporty two-door coupe version of the Kia Forte compact car. It offers a blend of style and affordability, making it appealing to younger buyers or those seeking a more engaging driving experience without breaking the bank. The 2017 model year offered two engine choices: a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 173 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. Another option was a more powerful 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine with 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options varied depending on the engine, including a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the Forte Koup for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and ample features for the price. Common complaints include a somewhat firm ride quality, limited rear passenger space, and occasional concerns about long-term reliability.
