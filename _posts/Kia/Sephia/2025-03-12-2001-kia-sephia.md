The 2001 Kia Sephia is a compact sedan known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It was offered with a single engine option: a 1.8L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 125 horsepower and 108 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options were either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Sephia for its value and simple design, but dislike its basic features and relatively unrefined driving experience compared to some competitors. Common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly as the vehicle ages.
