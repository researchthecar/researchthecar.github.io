The 2000 Kia Sephia is a compact sedan that was available with two engine options: a 1.8L SOHC 16-valve inline-4 (97 horsepower, 117 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.0L DOHC 16-valve inline-4 (130 horsepower, 140 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were mated to a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.
