**Introduction:**

The 1997 Kia Sephia is a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It was offered with two engine options: a 1.6L inline-4 and a 1.8L inline-4. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. The Sephia received praise for its roomy interior and comfortable ride, but was criticized for its lack of power and dated design.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

* **Head Gasket Failure:** Engine overheating, coolant leaks, and loss of power are common symptoms. The solution is to replace the head gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Vacuum leaks and a rough idle can indicate a failed intake manifold gasket. Replacing the gasket is the solution. **Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400**

**1.8L Inline-4**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Oil leaks from the valve cover are a common issue. The solution is to replace the valve cover gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200**
* **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure:** Intermittent stalling, difficulty starting, and engine misfires can be symptoms of a failed crankshaft position sensor. Replacing the sensor is the solution. **Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300**

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Synchronizer Wear:** Shifting into gears becomes difficult or grindy. Replacing the synchronizers is the solution. **Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,000**
