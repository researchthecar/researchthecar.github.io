The 2005 Kia Amanti is a mid-size sedan known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter Lambda V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Amanti for its value, quiet cabin, and smooth ride. However, some disliked its somewhat bland styling and less-than-stellar fuel economy compared to competitors.
