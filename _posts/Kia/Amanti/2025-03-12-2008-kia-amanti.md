**Summary**

The 2008 Kia Amanti, while offering value and space, presents potential owners with several common issues. Engine oil leaks and transmission problems such as rough shifting and torque converter issues are major concerns that can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension components such as struts, shocks and rear subframes are also known to wear out or corrode over time, potentially compromising the vehicle's handling and safety. Electrical problems, such as battery drain and ABS sensor failure, can also occur. While the severity and cost of these issues can vary, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
