The 2004 Kia Amanti is a full-size sedan that offered a comfortable ride and a spacious interior at an affordable price point. While appreciated for its value, it also had its share of issues. The sole engine option for the 2004 Amanti was a 3.5L Sigma V6 engine producing approximately 195 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the roomy cabin and smooth ride, but disliked the somewhat lackluster fuel economy and occasionally unrefined handling.

**Engine**

**3.5L Sigma V6**

*   **Engine Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often develop around the valve cover gaskets and the oil pan gasket. These leaks can cause a burning oil smell and, if left unaddressed, can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L Sigma V6 uses a timing belt, which requires periodic replacement. Failure to replace the timing belt at the recommended interval (typically around 60,000-90,000 miles) can lead to belt breakage, potentially causing severe engine damage due to valve interference.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt, water pump, tensioner, and idler pulley.

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting between gears, especially when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as clunking noises or jerking sensations.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported torque converter failure, resulting in poor acceleration, shuddering at low speeds, or complete loss of drive.

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory struts and shocks tend to wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
