The 2007 Kia Amanti is a full-size sedan that aimed for a more luxurious feel at a value price point. It was available with only one engine option: a 3.5L Lambda V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Amanti's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and generous standard features for its price. However, some common complaints include less-than-stellar fuel economy, a somewhat dated interior design, and some reliability concerns.
