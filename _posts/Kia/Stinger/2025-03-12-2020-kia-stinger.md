The 2020 Kia Stinger is a sporty and stylish fastback sedan that offers a compelling blend of performance, comfort, and value. It comes with two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 255 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 generating 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Stinger for its aggressive styling, powerful V6 engine, comfortable ride, and generous features for the price. Some common complaints include the relatively high fuel consumption and the lack of rear headroom compared to more traditional sedans.
