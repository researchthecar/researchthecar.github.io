The 2021 Kia Stinger is a popular sport sedan known for its stylish design, powerful engine options, and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine choices: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 255 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L twin-turbocharged V6 delivering 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. All models came standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Stinger for its performance, value, and distinctive looks, but some dislike its fuel economy and the fact that the interior quality isn't quite up to par with some luxury competitors.
