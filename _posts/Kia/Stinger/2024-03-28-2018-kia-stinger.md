**Introduction:**

The 2018 Kia Stinger is a performance-oriented sedan that offers an exciting driving experience. It is available with a choice of two engines: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-four or a 3.3L twin-turbocharged V6. Both engines can be paired with either an 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual transmission. The Stinger has received praise for its stylish design, powerful engines, and agile handling. However, there have been some reported issues with the vehicle.
