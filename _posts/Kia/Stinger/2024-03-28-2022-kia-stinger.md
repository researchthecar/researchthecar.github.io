**Introduction**

The 2022 Kia Stinger is a stylish sports sedan that offers a powerful and engaging driving experience. It is available with either a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 300 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque or a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine that produces 368 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive is standard. However, all-wheel drive is available as an option. The Stinger is praised for its athletic handling, spacious interior, and impressive performance. It also has a few drawbacks, such as a stiff ride on some surfaces and a somewhat cramped rear seat.
