The 2023 Kia Stinger is a sporty, fastback sedan that offers a compelling alternative to traditional luxury brands. It comes with two engine options: a 2.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 300 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L twin-turbocharged V6 delivering 368 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Stinger for its stylish design, powerful engines, comfortable ride, and generous standard features. Criticisms often include a slightly less refined interior compared to some competitors and fuel economy that is not class-leading.

The most common concerns revolve around minor engine hesitation (2.5L turbo), harsh transmission shifting, infotainment system glitches, and interior noises. The potential costs for repairs are generally manageable, with software updates often resolving many problems. However, more complex issues like infotainment system replacement or sensor malfunction can be more costly, highlighting the importance of warranty coverage. Overall, the Stinger seems to be a relatively reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the car before purchase.
