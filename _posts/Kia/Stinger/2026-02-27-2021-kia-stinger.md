### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Kia Stinger presents a generally reliable profile, especially with the 2.0L engine. However, the more potent 3.3L twin-turbo V6 engine introduces potential concerns related to turbocharger longevity and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as hesitant shifting or leaks, are also noted, though often resolvable with software updates or minor repairs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are present but not overwhelmingly common. Overall, the Stinger is a compelling performance sedan, but prospective buyers should be mindful of the specific mechanical components that may require more attention over time, especially those opting for the higher-performance variants.
