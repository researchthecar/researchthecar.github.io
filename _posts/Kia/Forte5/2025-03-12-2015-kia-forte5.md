The 2015 Kia Forte5 is a compact hatchback known for its stylish design, spacious interior, and generous standard features for its class. The Forte5 offered two engine options: a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 173 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. The 1.6L Turbo was available with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.0L was available with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
