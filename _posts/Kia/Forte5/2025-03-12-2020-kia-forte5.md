The 2020 Kia Forte5 is a hatchback version of the popular Kia Forte sedan. It's known for its sporty styling, practicality, and value. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The higher trim GT model boasts a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine that delivers 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Many owners appreciate the Forte5's fuel efficiency, spacious cargo area, and user-friendly technology. Common criticisms include a sometimes unrefined CVT transmission (on the 2.0L models), and a firm ride.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (CVT)**

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling or hesitating, particularly when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: The issue is often related to the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor. Replacing the MAF sensor resolves the issue. Some owners also have success with cleaning the throttle body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4 (DCT)**

*   **DCT Hesitation/Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission can exhibit hesitation, jerky shifting, and rough engagement, particularly in stop-and-go traffic or during low-speed maneuvers. This is a common characteristic of DCTs but can be perceived as a flaw.
    *   Solution: A software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may improve shift quality. In some cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for software updates. $1500 - $3000+ for clutch replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Matched with 2.0L Engine)**

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a pronounced whining or buzzing noise coming from the CVT transmission, especially during acceleration or at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT fluid or replacing the CVT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for CVT fluid change. $3,000 - $6,000+ for CVT replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed DCT (Matched with 1.6L Turbo Engine)**

*   **DCT Hesitation/Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission can exhibit hesitation, jerky shifting, and rough engagement, particularly in stop-and-go traffic or during low-speed maneuvers. This is a common characteristic of DCTs but can be perceived as a flaw.
    *   Solution: A software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may improve shift quality. In some cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for software updates. $1500 - $3000+ for clutch replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear sway bar bushings or end links. Sometimes replacing the rear shocks resolves the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive, requiring a reset or restart.
    *   Solution: Performing a software update or system reset. In some cases, replacing the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates (DIY or dealer). $500 - $1500+ for head unit replacement.

**Summary**

The 2020 Kia Forte5 has some reported issues, with the most common ones being related to the engine, transmission (especially the DCT), and electrical systems. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences like infotainment system glitches to more significant problems like CVT failure. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the issue, but some fixes can be relatively inexpensive, while others (like transmission replacements) can be costly.
