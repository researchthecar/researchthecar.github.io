The 2022 Kia Forte5 is a compact hatchback known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and user-friendly technology. The base engine is a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Some enjoy the Forte5's spacious cargo area and comfortable ride, while others find the base engine lacking in power and the CVT uninspiring. A more powerful 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine is available on the GT trim, producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) or a 6-speed manual transmission.
