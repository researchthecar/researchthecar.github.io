The 2023 Kia Forte5 is a compact hatchback known for its sporty styling, generous features, and value for money. It comes with two engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder generating 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0-liter engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 1.6-liter turbo uses a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the Forte5 for its fuel efficiency, user-friendly technology, and spacious cargo area. Common complaints revolve around the CVT's performance in the base engine and the DCT's occasional jerky behavior.

**Engine**

**2.0L MPI 4-Cylinder (147 hp, 132 lb-ft)**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional engine hesitation or stalling, particularly when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to reproduce.
    *   Solution: The common issue is related to a software problem in the engine control unit (ECU). A software update can fix this problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbo GDI 4-Cylinder (201 hp, 195 lb-ft)**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: In more severe cases, engine piston ring replacement might be necessary to reduce oil consumption. A compression test should be performed before any work is performed to verify it is not a faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) - Paired with 2.0L Engine**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or uneven acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Some describe a "rubber band" feeling during acceleration.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can often improve CVT performance. In some cases, CVT fluid flush or CVT replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7-Speed DCT (Dual-Clutch Transmission) - Paired with 1.6L Turbo Engine**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifting, particularly in low gears or during stop-and-go traffic. This can feel like a jerky or abrupt change in gear.
    *   Solution: A software update for the transmission control module can sometimes improve shift quality. In some instances, clutch replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary, although less common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or clunking noise from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: The issue is most likely caused by the rear stabilizer bar links. Replacing the links with an updated version can resolve the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Applying software updates. If the problem persists, replacing the unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headlight Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or both headlights may intermittently fail to function or flicker.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty bulb or checking the headlight electrical connector for corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or buzzing noise coming from the dashboard area, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the specific source of the rattle and adding padding or shims to secure loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Kia Forte5 is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues, particularly relating to the transmission's behavior (CVT and DCT). Engine hesitation, oil consumption, infotainment glitches, suspension noises, and rattling dashboards also appear with less prevalence. While some issues can be resolved with software updates or minor repairs, transmission or engine repairs can be more costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a pre-purchase inspection, paying close attention to the transmission's performance and any unusual noises from the engine or suspension.
