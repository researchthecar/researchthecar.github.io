The 2014 Kia Forte5 is a compact hatchback that offers a good blend of practicality, features, and value. Engine options include a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing 173 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Forte5's sporty handling, spacious cargo area, and generous warranty. Criticisms often revolve around the relatively firm ride, some cheap interior materials, and the fuel economy not always matching EPA estimates.

*   **Loss of Power/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of experiencing sudden loss of power, hesitation during acceleration, and/or the engine going into "limp mode". Sometimes accompanied by error codes related to the turbocharger or fuel system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis includes checking the turbocharger wastegate, boost pressure sensors, fuel injectors, and high-pressure fuel pump. Repair involves replacing faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated GDI (Nu) Engine**

*   **Engine Stalling**
