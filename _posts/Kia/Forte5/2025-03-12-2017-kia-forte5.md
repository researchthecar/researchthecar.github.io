**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving or idling. This can be intermittent and may not trigger any warning lights initially.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include a faulty mass airflow sensor, crankshaft position sensor, or issues with the fuel system. Diagnosis requires a mechanic to pinpoint the exact cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rapid decrease in engine oil levels between oil changes. May be accompanied by blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include worn piston rings or valve seals. An oil consumption test can help determine the severity. Repair may involve replacing the piston rings or valve seals.
