The 2016 Kia Forte5 is a compact hatchback known for its value, practicality, and sporty styling. Engine options included a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 engine producing 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, though the 1.6T engine typically came with the automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Forte5's roomy interior, long warranty (at the time of purchase), and available features. Common dislikes include the sometimes unrefined ride quality and the base engine's adequate but not thrilling performance.
