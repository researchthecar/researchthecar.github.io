The 2018 Kia Forte5 is a compact hatchback offering a practical and stylish option for consumers. It was available with two engine choices: a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 generating 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L turbo came with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners often praise the Forte5 for its value, ample cargo space, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints include a somewhat unrefined ride, especially on rough roads, and the occasionally jerky behavior of the DCT transmission.

The 2018 Kia Forte5 generally suffers from a mix of minor and potentially major issues. The DCT transmission, especially in the 1.6L turbo variant, may exhibit some jerky behavior. While not necessarily a reliability problem, it can affect the driving experience. Engine issues, such as engine knock or turbocharger failure, are less common but can be costly to repair. Electrical issues like the backup camera and the infotainment system freezing are more frequently reported but generally less expensive to address. Overall, pre-purchase inspection and a thorough test drive are recommended, especially checking the condition and responsiveness of the transmission.
