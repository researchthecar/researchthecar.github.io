**Introduction**

The 2005 Kia Spectra is a compact sedan offered with two engine and two transmission options. The 1.6L 4-cylinder engine produces 105 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.0L 4-cylinder engine generates 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The Spectra was praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior, but criticized for its lackluster performance and unrefined ride quality.
