The 2006 Kia Spectra is a compact sedan known for its affordability and spacious interior. It was available with a single engine option: a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing approximately 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Spectra's low price point and comfortable ride. However, common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly with certain components wearing out prematurely.

**Summary**

The 2006 Kia Spectra, while an affordable and practical vehicle, does have some common issues. The most concerning issues are related to the engine (catalytic converter, oxygen sensors) and transmission (rough shifting), which can be moderately expensive to repair. Suspension and electrical problems, such as strut/shock failure and alternator failure, are also relatively common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. While not all Spectras will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic before purchasing.
