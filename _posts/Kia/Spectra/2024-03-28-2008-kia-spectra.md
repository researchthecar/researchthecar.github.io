**Introduction:**

The 2008 Kia Spectra is a compact sedan available with two engine options: a 1.6L inline-four and a 2.0L inline-four. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The 1.6L engine produces 110 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.0L engine produces 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque.
