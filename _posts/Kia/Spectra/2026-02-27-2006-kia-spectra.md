### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Kia Spectra is a budget-friendly compact car that generally holds up well, but it's not without its potential issues. Common problems tend to revolve around the engine (oil leaks, timing belt concerns), transmission (especially the automatic's shifting quality), and suspension components like ball joints and tie rods. Electrical issues such as faulty window regulators and alternators are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate.
