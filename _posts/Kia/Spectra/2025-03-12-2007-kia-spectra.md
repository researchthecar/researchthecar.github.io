The 2007 Kia Spectra is a compact sedan known for its affordability and practicality. It was offered with a single engine option: a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Spectra for its value, spacious interior for its class, and long warranty (at the time). However, some common criticisms include its unrefined engine, basic interior materials, and somewhat bland styling.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (G4GC)**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated (typically code P0420 - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold), reduced fuel economy, potential for failed emissions test, rattling sound from the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Ensure that the upstream oxygen sensor is inspected/replaced as well, as a failing sensor can contribute to catalytic converter failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, check engine light illuminated (typically code P0335 - Crankshaft Position Sensor A Circuit Malfunction).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling at idle, erratic idle speeds, check engine light may illuminate.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the IAC valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (A4CF1)**

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, slipping between gears, check engine light illuminated (typically codes P0750, P0753, P0755, P0758).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty shift solenoid(s). A transmission fluid flush and filter change are often recommended as part of the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual (M5GF1)**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps, reduced ride comfort.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear strut mounts. Often, the struts themselves are replaced at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on whether struts are also replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front or rear suspension, especially when turning or driving over uneven surfaces, reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window fails to operate, window moves slowly or erratically, grinding noise from the door panel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HVAC blower motor only works on some speeds (typically high), no blower motor operation at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Switch Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the vehicle, intermittent stalling, accessories not functioning correctly, the key gets stuck in the ignition.
    * Solution: Replacement of the ignition switch assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Outer door handle breaks, making it difficult or impossible to open the door from the outside.

**Summary:** The 2007 Kia Spectra has a mix of minor and moderate issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly catalytic converter failure and shift solenoid issues, can be costly to repair. Suspension components, window regulators, and electrical gremlins are also relatively common. While many of these issues are manageable and can be addressed with reasonable repairs, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more serious mechanical failures. The cost to fix varies significantly, from under $100 for a blower motor resistor to several hundred dollars for a catalytic converter or transmission repair.
