The 2004 Kia Spectra was a compact car known for its affordability and practicality. It came equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing around 124 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the Spectra's spacious interior for its class and its value for money. However, common dislikes revolved around its less refined driving dynamics, basic features, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (DOHC)**

* **Check Engine Light due to Faulty Oxygen Sensors**
    * Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, often accompanied by decreased fuel economy and/or rough running. Diagnostic codes commonly point to faulty oxygen sensors (O2 sensors).
    * Solution: Replace the faulty O2 sensor(s). Often, both upstream and downstream sensors are replaced at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor, depending on location and shop rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine performance, rattling noise from underneath the vehicle, and failing emissions tests.
    * Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the brand of converter.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Problems/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifting between gears, particularly when cold. Slipping during acceleration.
    * Solution: Often starts with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, a more in-depth diagnostic is required. Solenoids may be faulty. In severe cases, the transmission may require a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush: $100 - $200. Solenoid replacement: $200 - $500+. Rebuild/replacement: $1500 - $3500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll when cornering, longer stopping distances, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per pair, depending on the brand and shop rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Sway Bar Links/Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension when driving over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links and/or bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per link/bushing, depending on location and shop rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to roll up or down, intermittent operation, or slow movement.
    * Solution: Check the window motor, regulator, and switches. Often, the motor or regulator needs replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window, depending on the part and shop rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, or a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on sensor quality and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can form on the vehicle's body panels, undercarriage, and around wheel wells.
    * Solution: Minor surface rust can be treated by sanding and painting. More severe rust may require panel replacement or extensive bodywork.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (small spots) - $1000+ (major rust repair).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Broken Door Handles**
    * Description/Symptoms: Interior or exterior door handles breaking, making it difficult to open the doors.
    * Solution: Replace the broken door handle assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per handle, depending on part and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Kia Spectra is generally a reliable vehicle for its age, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. The most common issues relate to the oxygen sensors, catalytic converter, shifting problems with the automatic transmission, suspension components like struts and sway bar links, and power windows. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, transmission or rust repairs can be costly. Owners should be proactive with maintenance to mitigate these issues and extend the lifespan of their Spectra.
