The 2018 Kia Cadenza is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and elegant styling. It came with a single engine option, a 3.3-liter Lambda II V6 engine that produced 290 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Cadenza's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and value for money. Common complaints revolve around the sometimes lackluster fuel economy for a full-size sedan and the somewhat dated infotainment system compared to newer models.
