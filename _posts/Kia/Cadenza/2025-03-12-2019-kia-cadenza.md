The 2019 Kia Cadenza is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and upscale features. It's powered by a 3.3-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the Cadenza's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and value for money, some common complaints revolve around its infotainment system and occasional electrical glitches. The 2019 model did not receive any significant changes from the 2017-2018 models, but did get discontinued in 2020 in North America.
