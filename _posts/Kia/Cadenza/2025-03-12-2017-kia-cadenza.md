The 2017 Kia Cadenza is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and stylish design. It offers a good balance of luxury and value. The 2017 Cadenza came with a single engine option: a 3.3-liter Lambda II V6 engine that produces 290 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque. It was paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Cadenza's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and user-friendly technology.
