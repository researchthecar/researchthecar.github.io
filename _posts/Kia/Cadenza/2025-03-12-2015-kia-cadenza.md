The 2015 Kia Cadenza is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and generous features for the price. It comes equipped with a 3.3-liter Lambda II V6 engine producing 293 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Cadenza's upscale styling, quiet cabin, and value proposition. Some common criticisms include the somewhat uninspired handling and average fuel economy compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**3.3L Lambda II V6**

*   **Engine Knocking/Tick Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a knocking or ticking noise emanating from the engine, particularly upon cold start or during acceleration. The noise may be related to wear in the connecting rod bearings or piston slap.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial to pinpoint the source of the noise. Depending on the severity, solutions can range from using a heavier weight oil to replacing the affected engine components (bearings, pistons, connecting rods) or even replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, the smell of burning oil, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Thoroughly clean the affected area after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation during acceleration or a feeling of the transmission "slipping" can also occur.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be inspected or replaced. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the rear suspension when driving over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace the rear sway bar links or bushings. Inspect and replace any worn shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Touchscreen/Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The touchscreen may become unresponsive, freeze, or display distorted images. Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation malfunctions, and audio system problems can also occur.

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain quickly, especially if the car sits unused for several days. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested for its health, and check the charging system for proper operation. Check for parasitic draws by testing amperage draw with the car off and key out. If the draw is excessive, isolate the circuit or component causing the drain and repair or replace it.
