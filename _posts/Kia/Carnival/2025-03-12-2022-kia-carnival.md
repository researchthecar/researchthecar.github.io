The 2022 Kia Carnival is a minivan offering a stylish alternative to its more utilitarian competitors. Powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 290 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, it provides ample power for daily driving and family trips. People appreciate its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and modern technology. Common complaints revolve around infotainment system glitches, availability of certain features due to supply chain issues, and some reported transmission issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 GDI**

*   **Engine Stalling/Failure to Start**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling while driving or failing to start. In some cases, a "check engine" light illuminates before or during the stalling event.
    *   Solution: The issue may involve faulty fuel pump, fuel delivery issues, or issues with the PCM or ECM. Diagnosis by a qualified technician is required to identify the root cause and perform the appropriate repair, which could include fuel pump replacement, fuel line repair, or PCM/ECM reprogramming.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 3.5L V6 engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes, requiring frequent top-ups.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause requires a leak-down test and cylinder inspection. Possible causes include worn piston rings or valve seals. Repair may involve replacing these components, which can be a significant engine overhaul.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears (e.g., 2nd to 3rd). This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: The issue may be due to a software glitch or a faulty transmission control module (TCM). A possible solution is to reprogram or replace the TCM. If that doesn't fix the issue, it could be internal damage to the transmission, requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have described instances of transmission slipping (engine revving without corresponding acceleration) or delayed engagement (a noticeable pause before the transmission engages a gear).
    *   Solution: The problem can stem from low transmission fluid, a faulty valve body, or worn clutch packs. Repair may involve a transmission fluid flush, valve body replacement, or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (including navigation, audio, and climate controls) may freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot. This can occur intermittently and disrupt the vehicle's functionality.
    *   Solution: Try performing a soft reset of the system. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sliding Door Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The automatic sliding doors may fail to open or close properly, or may exhibit erratic behavior (e.g., opening unexpectedly).
    * Solution: Check for obstructions in the door tracks. If no obstructions are present, the issue may be with the door motor, sensors, or control module. Replacement of the faulty component may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: 23V-824 is for sliding door motor assembly may cause door to open while driving.

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate may fail to open or close properly, or may exhibit erratic behavior (e.g., opening unexpectedly).
    *   Solution: Check for obstructions near the tailgate. If no obstructions are present, the issue may be with the tailgate motor, sensors, or control module. Replacement of the faulty component may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Adjustment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power seats may become stuck in a certain position or fail to adjust properly. The lumbar support may also fail.
    *   Solution: The issue could stem from a faulty seat motor, switch, or wiring harness. Replacement of the defective part is typically required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Kia Carnival, while generally reliable, does have some recurring issues. Engine problems like stalling and oil consumption, along with transmission issues such as harsh shifting, can be costly to repair. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system and sliding doors, also appear. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs to the engine or transmission can significantly impact the overall cost of ownership. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider purchasing an extended warranty for added peace of mind.
