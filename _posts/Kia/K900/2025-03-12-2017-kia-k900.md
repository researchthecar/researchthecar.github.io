The 2017 Kia K900 is a luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and a range of features. It came with two engine options: a 3.8-liter V6 producing 311 horsepower and 293 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0-liter V8 generating 420 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the K900's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and long list of standard features. Some common dislikes include its bland styling, lack of brand recognition compared to established luxury brands, and depreciation.
