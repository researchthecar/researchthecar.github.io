The 2020 Kia K900 is a full-size luxury sedan that aims to offer a premium experience at a competitive price point. It comes standard with a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the K900's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and long list of standard features. However, some criticisms include the less-than-stellar fuel economy, somewhat anonymous styling, and the fact that it doesn't hold its value as well as some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2020 Kia K900, while generally reliable, can experience a few common issues. The most prevalent problems seem to stem from oil leaks in the engine and potential for turbocharger issues. Transmission problems are also reported but are less common. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and sensor failures are also a potential concern. Suspension issues with the air suspension (if equipped) can arise. The severity and cost of these repairs vary depending on the specific issue, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems when considering a used 2020 Kia K900.
