The 2015 Kia K900 is a full-size luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a host of features. It was available with two engine options: a 3.8-liter V6 producing 311 horsepower and 293 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 5.0-liter V8 generating 420 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the K900 for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and value compared to other luxury brands. However, some common complaints include a somewhat bland exterior styling, less sporty handling than competitors, and a depreciation hit due to the Kia badge in the luxury segment.
