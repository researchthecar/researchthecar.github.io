The 2019 Kia Forte is a compact sedan known for its value, fuel efficiency, and user-friendly technology. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission (on the FE trim) or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) on all other trims. People generally appreciate the Forte's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and long warranty. Common dislikes include the CVT's sometimes sluggish response and the engine's lack of outright power.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (147 hp, 132 lb-ft)**

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported a knocking or ticking noise coming from the engine, especially during cold starts or while idling. In some cases, this could indicate a potential issue with the connecting rod bearings or piston slap.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is crucial. Depending on the severity, the solution could range from an oil change with a heavier weight oil to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change) - $4000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: A mechanic should perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil loss. Potential causes include worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or PCV valve issues. The repair may involve replacing these components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (PCV valve) - $2000+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT may exhibit hesitation or jerking, particularly during initial acceleration or when trying to pass another vehicle. This can feel like the transmission is struggling to find the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: First, ensure the CVT fluid is at the correct level and in good condition. A CVT fluid change may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, it could indicate an issue with the valve body or the CVT itself, requiring more extensive repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (CVT fluid change) - $4000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature CVT failure, resulting in complete loss of power, loud noises, or inability to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rear sway bar end links, shocks, and bushings for wear or damage. Replace any worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive, requiring a restart.
    *   Solution: Start by checking for software updates and installing the latest version. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may fail to display an image, show a distorted image, or intermittently work.
    *   Solution: Check the camera wiring and connections for damage. If the wiring is intact, the camera itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation may form inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs.
    *   Solution: Check the headlight housing seals and replace them if necessary. In some cases, drilling a small drain hole in the bottom of the housing can help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking can occur on the dashboard, particularly in hot climates, due to sun exposure and temperature fluctuations.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100+ (dashboard cover) - $1000+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Kia Forte, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. Engine problems like knocking and excessive oil consumption can be costly to fix. CVT issues, including hesitation and even failure, are a concern. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera also occur. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be significant. Potential buyers should have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing, paying particular attention to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems.
