Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2017 Kia Forte, categorized by major components. The 2017 Kia Forte is a compact car known for its value, fuel efficiency, and features. Engine options included a 1.8-liter inline-4 (LX, S) producing 145 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter inline-4 (EX) delivering 164 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. A turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-4 with 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque was available on the SX trim. The 1.8L engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0L and 1.6L Turbo were only paired to the 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers typically appreciate the Forte's comfortable ride and generous features for the price, but some dislike the somewhat uninspired handling and engine noise.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline-4**

* **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report a knocking or pinging sound coming from the engine, especially during acceleration or when under load. This can be more noticeable with lower octane fuel.
    * Solution: Using higher octane fuel (89 or 91) may reduce the knocking. In some cases, a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) or cleaning of the fuel injectors might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (fuel change) - $300+ (ECU update or injector cleaning)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 1.8L engine consumes more oil than expected between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is crucial. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection may be required to check for leaks or internal engine issues. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (monitoring) - $1000+ (engine repairs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Inline-4**

* **No Issues Found**

**1.6L Turbo Inline-4**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**
* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed harsh or jerky shifting, especially between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes has also been reported.
    * Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, a dealer inspection may be needed to check for valve body issues or other internal problems. In some cases, a software update can improve shift quality.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush) - $800+ (valve body repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises emanating from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: Inspect and potentially replace the rear shock absorbers, sway bar links, or bushings. These components can wear out and cause noise.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Radio/Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (radio, navigation, etc.) may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart.
    * Solution: Check for available software updates for the infotainment system. A dealer visit may be necessary to apply the update. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Dead Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or excessive battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    * Solution: Have the battery tested to determine its condition. Check for parasitic draws that may be draining the battery when the vehicle is off. A new battery may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking developing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Applying a UV protectant to the dashboard can help prevent further cracking. Repairing or replacing the dashboard is a more extensive (and costly) solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (UV protectant) - $800+ (dashboard replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Kia Forte is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues, particularly concerning the engine and transmission. Oil consumption in the 1.8L engine and harsh shifting in the automatic transmission are areas to watch out for. Electrical glitches, such as infotainment system issues and battery drain, can also occur. While most of these issues are not catastrophic, addressing them promptly can prevent more significant problems down the road. The severity and cost vary, but some repairs, like engine work or dashboard replacement, can be relatively expensive.
