The 2023 Kia Forte is a compact sedan known for its value, fuel efficiency, and user-friendly technology. It offers two engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 147 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 201 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are front-wheel drive. The 2.0L engine is typically paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), while the 1.6L turbo engine is paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT). Owners generally appreciate the Forte's affordability, spacious cabin, and comprehensive suite of safety features. Some common complaints include the CVT's occasionally sluggish response with the 2.0L engine, and the firm ride quality on certain trim levels. Some drivers have also noted the lack of excitement compared to other sporty sedans.

**Summary**

The 2023 Kia Forte appears to be a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with the engine hesitation/stalling on the 2.0L engine, and occasional jerky acceleration with the CVT. Suspension noises and electrical system glitches, such as infotainment system problems and sensor malfunctions, are also relatively common complaints. While some issues can be resolved with software updates or minor repairs, others may require more extensive and costly fixes. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially impacting the driving experience and safety. The estimated cost to address these issues can range from under $100 for minor fixes to over $800 for more complex repairs. Overall, it is recommended to research common issues specific to the engine and trim level you are interested in and have a trusted mechanic perform a pre-purchase inspection to check for any potential problems.
