Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2012 Kia Forte, formatted for your website.

The 2012 Kia Forte is a compact car known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and generous features for its price point. It was available as a sedan, coupe (Koup), and hatchback (5-door). Engine options included a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 156 horsepower and 144 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 173 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque, both available with either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Forte's value and fuel economy, while common dislikes include road noise, a somewhat stiff ride, and reported reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  A noticeable knocking or ticking sound coming from the engine, especially at idle or during acceleration. May be caused by worn connecting rod bearings.
    *   Solution:  Diagnose the source of the noise.  If connecting rod bearings are worn, replacement of the bearings is required. In severe cases, the entire engine may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (bearing replacement), $3,000 - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The oil level in the engine decreases rapidly between oil changes.
    * Solution: Start with a compression test to check the engine's condition. Replacing piston rings can reduce oil consumption in some cases. If the cylinders are damaged, an engine replacement is the only viable option.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000 (piston rings), $3,000 - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls unexpectedly while driving, particularly at low speeds or when idling. This can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the stalling. Potential causes include a faulty mass airflow sensor, a dirty throttle body, or a malfunctioning crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the failed part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission shifts roughly or hesitates between gears. Slipping can occur during acceleration, with the engine revving higher than normal without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution:  Check transmission fluid level and condition.  If low or burnt, a fluid change may help. If the problem persists, internal damage (valve body, clutch packs) may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (fluid change), $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  A noticeable delay when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution:  Check transmission fluid level and condition. If the issue persists, it could indicate a problem with the transmission's valve body or internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (valve body), $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn rear shock absorbers or bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspect rear shocks and bushings for wear or damage. Replace worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side, depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working intermittently or completely.  This can affect one or more windows.
    *   Solution:  Check the power window switch, motor, and wiring.  The switch is often the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (switch), $150 - $400+ (motor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls and does not restart, or takes several tries to start. The check engine light may be on.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture builds up inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Check the headlight housing seals and vents. Replacing the seals or the entire headlight assembly can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (seals), $200 - $500+ (headlight assembly)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may get stuck, make grinding noises when opening/closing, or leak.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sunroof tracks, motor, and seals. Lubricate the tracks or replace worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (lubrication/adjustment), $200 - $800+ (motor/track repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Kia Forte can be a good value, but potential buyers should be aware of potential reliability issues. Engine problems, particularly knocking noises and oil consumption on the 2.0L engine, and transmission problems on the automatic variants can lead to costly repairs. Suspension noises and electrical issues like power window failures are also common complaints. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission repairs can be significant. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
