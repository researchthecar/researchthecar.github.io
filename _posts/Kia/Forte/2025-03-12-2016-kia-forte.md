The 2016 Kia Forte is a compact car known for its value, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine producing 145 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 173 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Forte's spacious interior, user-friendly technology, and long warranty. However, some common complaints include lackluster acceleration with the 1.8L engine, reported issues with engine components, and occasional electrical glitches.

**Summary**

The 2016 Kia Forte can be a reliable and economical choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues reported by owners. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine, particularly the 1.8L variant, where engine knocking and failure have been reported. The transmission can also exhibit issues, such as harsh shifting and slipping. Electrical glitches, like faulty door lock actuators, malfunctioning Bluetooth, and TPMS sensor failures, are also frequent complaints. Suspension and exterior problems are also mentioned, but less severe. The cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the issue. Given the severity of some engine-related problems, a thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended before purchasing a used 2016 Kia Forte.
