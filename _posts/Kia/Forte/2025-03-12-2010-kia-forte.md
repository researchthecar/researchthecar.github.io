**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a noticeable knocking or ticking noise coming from the engine, especially at idle or low speeds. This may be related to worn rod bearings or piston slap.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed to pinpoint the exact cause. Depending on the severity, the repair may range from replacing the rod bearings to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes, requiring frequent top-offs.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed. Potential causes could be worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or PCV valve issues. The repair may involve replacing these components or an engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+
