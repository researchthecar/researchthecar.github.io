The 2024 Kia K5 is a stylish mid-size sedan known for its sporty design and value. Engine options include a standard 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A more powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, generating 290 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque, is available on the GT trim, coupled with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the K5 for its attractive styling, comfortable ride, and generous features for the price. However, some common complaints revolve around the responsiveness of the base engine, occasional infotainment glitches, and the sensitivity of the advanced driver-assistance systems.

**Engine**

**1.6L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Engine Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil pressure warning light illuminating, or the oil level dropping significantly on the dipstick.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks or abnormal consumption promptly is recommended. Further diagnosis may involve checking for leaks, performing an oil consumption test, and inspecting the PCV system. In severe cases, engine component replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ depending on the severity of the consumption
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Lag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some drivers have noticed a delay in power delivery from the turbocharger, especially at lower engine speeds. This can manifest as a hesitation or sluggish acceleration when initially pressing the accelerator pedal.
    * Solution: While some turbo lag is inherent in turbocharged engines, ensuring proper engine maintenance, including clean air filters and functioning boost control systems, can help minimize it. In some cases, a software update may improve throttle response.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (1.6L Engine)**

*   **Hesitation or Jerky Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation during gear changes, particularly when shifting from lower to higher gears. This can manifest as a momentary delay or a jerky sensation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Checking the transmission fluid level and condition is recommended. A transmission fluid flush or replacement may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a software update or transmission repair may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+ depending on the severity of the problem
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (2.5L Engine)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven road surfaces. This may indicate worn or loose suspension components.
    * Solution: Inspecting and replacing worn suspension components, such as sway bar links, bushings, or shock absorbers, can resolve the noise.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the components needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, or intermittent black screens on the infotainment system. Issues may also include Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealership are the most common fix. In some cases, a complete system reset or replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $1,000+ (for head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (ADAS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) such as lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, or blind-spot monitoring. These can be indicated by warning lights or system deactivation.
    *   Solution: Recalibrating or replacing the affected sensor is usually necessary. Diagnostic scans can pinpoint the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the sensor and recalibration needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, particularly when driving on rough roads or at certain speeds.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing the loose components, such as trim pieces or wiring harnesses, is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
