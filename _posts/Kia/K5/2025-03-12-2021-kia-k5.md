Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Kia K5, formatted as requested.

The 2021 Kia K5 marked a significant redesign, replacing the Optima in Kia's lineup. Engine options include a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder (LX, LXS, GT-Line, EX trims) producing 180 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L turbocharged four-cylinder (GT trim) generating 290 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, although the GT's 2.5L engine gets a wet dual-clutch version. Owners often praise the K5's stylish design, spacious interior, and long list of standard features. Common criticisms include some perceived cheap interior materials, and occasional complaints about the base engine's performance feeling adequate but not particularly exciting.
