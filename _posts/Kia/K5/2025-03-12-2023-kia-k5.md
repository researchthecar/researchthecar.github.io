The 2023 Kia K5 is a mid-size sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and value. It offers two engine options: a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 180 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder generating 290 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, but the 2.5L is the only configuration with the 8-speed DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission). Owners generally praise the K5's modern aesthetics, user-friendly technology, and spacious cabin. Some common dislikes include the sometimes-firm ride (especially on models with larger wheels), and the occasional lag in the 1.6L engine's power delivery.

**Engine**

*   **Hesitation/Lag During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a noticeable delay or hesitation when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This can be especially pronounced when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Software update to the ECU, or throttle body cleaning. In rare cases, throttle body replacement may be required.

**8-Speed DCT (Dual Clutch Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    * Description/Symptoms: The DCT transmission can exhibit hesitation or jerking during slow-speed maneuvers, such as parking or navigating stop-and-go traffic. This is a common characteristic of DCTs due to their design.
    * Solution: Software update for the transmission control module (TCM). Follow proper DCT driving techniques (avoid creeping in traffic).

**Summary**

The 2023 Kia K5 generally has a good reliability record, but some owners have reported issues with engine hesitation (1.6T), oil consumption (2.5T), DCT hesitation/jerking, rough shifting, infotainment glitches, and rattles. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Some issues can be resolved with software updates or minor repairs, while others, such as engine or transmission problems, may require more extensive and costly repairs. Checking for recalls is always advisable.
