The 2022 Kia K5 is a mid-size sedan known for its sporty styling, comfortable ride, and feature-rich cabin. Engine options include a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 180 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 290 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque.
