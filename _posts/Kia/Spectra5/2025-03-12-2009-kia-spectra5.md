Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2009 Kia Spectra5, categorized by major components, along with specific details regarding symptoms, solutions, estimated costs, and recall information. The 2009 Kia Spectra5 is a compact hatchback known for its affordability and practicality. All trims of the Spectra5 came equipped with a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options included a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the car's fuel efficiency and spacious cargo area, but some find the ride quality and engine performance lacking compared to competitors. Reported issues often revolve around reliability and component longevity.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (G4GC)**

*   **Check Engine Light due to Faulty Oxygen Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, often accompanied by codes related to oxygen sensor malfunction (e.g., P0133, P0135, P0141). Reduced fuel economy may also be observed.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor(s). Typically, replacing the upstream (before catalytic converter) sensor resolves the issue. Diagnosing the specific sensor is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per sensor (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (e.g., P0420). Reduced engine performance and potential emissions test failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter. Ensure underlying engine issues (e.g., excessive oil consumption) are addressed to prevent premature failure of the new converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and a noticeable decrease in power. The check engine light may illuminate with misfire codes (e.g., P0300, P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the misfire, which could include faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, fuel injectors, or vacuum leaks. Replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per cylinder (depending on the failed component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (A4CF1)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable clunking or jerky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate the problem. However, more severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush: $100-$200, Valve body repair: $500 - $1000+, Transmission rebuild/replacement: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual (M5GF1)**
*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and bottoming out over bumps. Premature tire wear can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks. Consider replacing both front or both rear struts simultaneously for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per pair (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Stabilizer Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn stabilizer bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per link (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate correctly, often getting stuck in the up or down position.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The climate control fan only works on certain speeds (usually only high) or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage and Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the undercarriage, especially in areas exposed to road salt. Rust can also appear on body panels, particularly around wheel wells and door edges.
    *   Solution: Address rust promptly by removing it and applying rust inhibitors or paint. In severe cases, body panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depends heavily on the extent of the rust. Minor surface rust: $100-$300, Significant rust repair or panel replacement: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**
