The 2007 Kia Spectra5 is a compact hatchback known for its affordability and practicality. It came standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 cylinder engine, producing around 138 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically appreciate the Spectra5 for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and value for money. Common complaints often revolve around its somewhat lackluster fuel economy compared to competitors and basic interior features.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder (G4GC)**

*   **Check Engine Light - P0420 Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Check Engine Light illuminates, and a diagnostic scan reveals a P0420 code, indicating the catalytic converter is not functioning efficiently. This can lead to reduced fuel economy and potential emissions test failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. Inspect the oxygen sensors (upstream and downstream) for proper function and replace if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine idles roughly, stumbles, or stalls, particularly when the engine is cold. This could be caused by issues within the IAC (Idle Air Control Valve), as well as a faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the Idle Air Control Valve (IAC). Cleaning or replacing the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, shifts erratically, or hesitates during acceleration. This can be accompanied by a delayed engagement when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive or Reverse.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, the transmission may require a rebuild or replacement of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle shifts harshly from gear to gear, with loud sounds during the gear changes
    *   Solution: Replacing transmission fluid, or rebuilding the transmission
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging/Bottoming Out**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, particularly when carrying passengers or cargo. The suspension may bottom out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs and/or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clunking Noises From Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises emanating from the suspension components, especially when driving over uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar links, bushings, struts, or ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more of the power windows fail to operate. This could be due to a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor only works on certain speeds (usually high) or not at all. This is often caused by a failed blower motor resistor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exterior door handles, especially the driver's side handle, can break or become difficult to operate.

**Summary:**

The 2007 Kia Spectra5 presents a mix of minor and potentially more costly issues. The engine and transmission issues, such as catalytic converter failure and erratic shifting, can range from moderate to significant expenses. Suspension problems are generally less severe but can impact ride quality. Electrical and interior issues are often less costly to address. While some issues are common, routine maintenance and timely repairs can help prolong the vehicle's lifespan and mitigate potential problems.
