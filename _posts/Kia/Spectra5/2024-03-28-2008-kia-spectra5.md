**2008 Kia Spectra5**

The 2008 Kia Spectra5 is a compact hatchback that was available with three engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-four (110 horsepower, 107 lb-ft of torque), a 2.0-liter inline-four (140 horsepower, 136 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.4-liter inline-four (173 horsepower, 168 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a standard five-speed manual transmission, while a four-speed automatic transmission was available as an option.

The Spectra5 was praised for its affordability, spacious interior, and sporty handling, but it was criticized for its lack of power from the base engine and its subpar fuel economy.
