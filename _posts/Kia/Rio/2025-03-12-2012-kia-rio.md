The 2012 Kia Rio is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, stylish design (for its time), and relatively spacious interior compared to other vehicles in its class. It was available with a 1.6-liter Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. It came standard with a six-speed manual transmission, but most were equipped with the optional six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Rio for its affordability, fuel economy, and long warranty (at the time of purchase). Common complaints include a somewhat firm ride, road noise, and some owners have reported issues with reliability, which is reflected below.

**Engine**

**1.6L GDI Four-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Knocking/Piston Slap**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking sound, especially when cold, originating from the engine. Some owners report this eventually leading to engine failure. This can be caused by excessive wear to the piston walls causing them to slap against the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rapid decrease in oil level between oil changes. Can lead to engine damage if not monitored and addressed.
    *   Solution: Engine repair or replacement may be needed. In some cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil can temporarily mitigate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes relating to catalytic converter efficiency. Poor fuel economy and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting between gears, particularly from 1st to 2nd. Transmission may slip, causing a temporary loss of power.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can improve shifting. If the issue persists, transmission repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the rear of the vehicle when going over bumps. Excessive bouncing or instability, particularly at higher speeds.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, check engine light.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Brake Light Switch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Brake lights not functioning, difficulty shifting out of park, cruise control malfunction.
    * Solution: Replacement of the brake light switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    * Recalls: Campaign Number: 13V114000 - certain vehicles may have a brake pedal stopper pad that may degrade, allowing the stop lamp switch plunger to remain extended when the brake pedal is not depressed.

**Summary**

The 2012 Kia Rio can be an affordable and fuel-efficient choice, but potential buyers should be aware of potential issues. Engine-related problems, especially those concerning excessive oil consumption and knocking, are among the most concerning due to the high cost of repair. Electrical issues, such as the brake light switch and clock spring failures, are also common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission problems can result in significant repair bills. It is essential to get a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's overall condition and identify any potential problems before buying.
