    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light (P0420 - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and a diagnostic scan reveals a P0420 code, indicating that the catalytic converter is not functioning efficiently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter. However, ensure that there are no exhaust leaks or other issues causing the code.
