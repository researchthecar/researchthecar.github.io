The 2001 Kia Rio was one of Kia's first forays into the subcompact market in the United States. The sole engine option was a 1.5L DOHC inline-4 cylinder engine producing 96 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. People generally liked the Rio for its affordability and fuel economy, while common dislikes included its lack of power, basic features, and sometimes questionable reliability.

**Engine**

**1.5L DOHC Inline-4**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can fail prematurely, especially if not replaced at the recommended interval. Symptoms include engine misfires, rough running, and eventually complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt and tensioner at the recommended interval (typically every 60,000 miles). If the timing belt breaks, the engine may require extensive repairs, including replacing bent valves.

**Summary**

The 2001 Kia Rio, while affordable and economical, can suffer from various mechanical and electrical issues. Engine issues like timing belt and crankshaft position sensor failures can be costly if not addressed promptly. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic transmission, are also common and can lead to expensive repairs. Suspension components and electrical systems are also prone to failure over time. Rust is a significant concern, especially in certain climates. Overall, while some issues are minor, others can be quite expensive to fix, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect a used 2001 Rio and budget for potential repairs.
