The 2002 Kia Rio was a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It came with a single engine option, a 1.5-liter DOHC four-cylinder engine producing 96 horsepower and 98 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Rio's low price point and good gas mileage, but frequently disliked its basic features, limited power, and somewhat unrefined driving experience. Common criticisms also focused on the car's reliability and build quality.
