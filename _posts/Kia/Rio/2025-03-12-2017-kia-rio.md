The 2017 Kia Rio is a subcompact car known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and user-friendly technology. It came with two engine and transmission options. The most common is the 1.6L four-cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 119 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its nimble handling and easy parking in urban environments. However, common criticisms include its small size, limited rear seat space, and somewhat basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.6L GDI Inline-4**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine hesitation or stalling, particularly at low speeds or when accelerating from a stop. This can sometimes be accompanied by a check engine light.
    *   Solution: The issue can stem from a faulty mass airflow sensor, a dirty throttle body, or issues with the fuel delivery system (fuel pump or fuel injectors). A diagnostic scan can help pinpoint the cause. Replacing the faulty components, or cleaning/servicing the throttle body and fuel system are the solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature catalytic converter failure is a reported issue. Symptoms include a decrease in fuel economy, a sulfur smell from the exhaust, and a check engine light (often P0420 code).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter is the typical solution. However, it's crucial to diagnose the underlying cause (e.g., engine running rich) to prevent repeat failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh shifting or slipping between gears. This may be more noticeable in lower gears or during acceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may temporarily alleviate the problem. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a shuddering or vibration felt at certain speeds (usually between 30-45 mph) which indicates an issue with the torque converter.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with fluid specifically designed to address torque converter shudder can sometimes help. In other cases, torque converter replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $800+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and tear of the rear shock absorbers is a known issue. Symptoms include bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and potential noise from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ for parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failing Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators may fail, leading to the inability to lock or unlock one or more doors using the key fob or the interior switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator is the fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blown Fuses**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with fuses blowing repeatedly, often associated with the radio/infotainment system or other electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying the cause of the short circuit or overload and addressing that issue is the solution. Sometimes, a faulty component can cause the fuse to blow.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture can build up inside the headlight housings, creating condensation. This reduces visibility and can potentially damage the headlight bulbs or electrical components.
    * Solution: Removing the headlight and resealing it will get rid of the condensation. Sometimes, small breather holes will get clogged and they need to be cleared.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on if you can seal it yourself or have to buy a new headlight assembly.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console USB Port Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The USB ports in the center console may stop working, preventing the charging of devices or connection to the infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the USB port assembly is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Kia Rio, while generally reliable, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most concerning are the potential engine and transmission problems, as these can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, such as door lock actuator failure, are also relatively frequent. Overall, the severity of these problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. A thorough inspection and maintenance history review are recommended before purchasing a used 2017 Kia Rio.
