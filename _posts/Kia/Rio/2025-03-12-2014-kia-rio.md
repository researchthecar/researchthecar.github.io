The 2014 Kia Rio is a subcompact car known for its good fuel economy, stylish design (for its class), and a relatively spacious interior for its size. It offered a blend of practicality and value that appealed to budget-conscious buyers. However, some owners have reported issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Common praises for the vehicle include its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, particularly in urban environments. Common complaints often revolve around its relatively basic interior, occasionally rough ride, and somewhat underpowered engine for highway driving. All 2014 Kia Rios come with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 138 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2014 Kia Rio is a generally reliable subcompact car, but like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The engine and transmission issues, while not extremely common, can be costly to repair. Electrical problems and suspension wear are more prevalent and should be inspected, if possible, before purchase. The overall cost of repairs can range from minor (e.g., sensor replacement) to significant (e.g., transmission rebuild), so a thorough inspection is always recommended.
