The 2019 Kia Rio is a subcompact car known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and ease of use. It generally receives positive feedback for its value and handling, but some owners have reported issues, primarily with reliability. The 2019 Rio comes with a 1.6-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 119 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Engine Knocking/Pinging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported knocking or pinging noises coming from the engine, especially during acceleration or when under load. This can be more noticeable when using lower-octane fuel.
    *   Solution: Try using higher-octane fuel (premium) to see if the noise diminishes. If the issue persists, a dealer can diagnose and potentially reprogram the engine control unit (ECU) or inspect for carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $200+ (Diagnosis and ECU reprogramming). If carbon buildup is the cause, decarbonization services can range from $200 - $500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the catalytic converter. Symptoms include a check engine light (typically with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency), reduced engine performance, and a sulfur-like smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter. It is important to diagnose the root cause of the failure, as this can be caused by oil leaks or other engine issues, so they dont destroy the new cat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have noted rough or jerky shifting between gears. Some have also reported a hesitation or delay in engagement, especially when shifting from park or reverse to drive.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, a fluid change may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a dealer can diagnose and potentially reprogram the transmission control module (TCM) or inspect for mechanical issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid change), $75 - $200+ (diagnosis and TCM reprogramming), $500 - $2000+ (for more significant repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Try performing a soft reset of the system (consult the owner's manual for instructions). If the issue persists, a dealer can update the system software or replace the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (soft reset), $75 - $200+ (software update), $500 - $1500+ (head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Headlight Performance**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have complained about dim or inadequate headlight performance, especially in low-light conditions.
    *   Solution: Ensure the headlights are properly aligned. Consider upgrading to brighter aftermarket bulbs. If the headlight assemblies are cloudy or damaged, they may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (headlight alignment), $20 - $100+ (bulb upgrade), $200 - $500+ (headlight assembly replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Locate the source of the noise and try to tighten any loose trim pieces or apply felt tape to areas where parts may be rubbing together.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ (DIY fixes or small repairs), $100 - $300+ (professional diagnosis and repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Kia Rio presents with a mix of potential issues, the most common of which relate to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Engine issues like knocking and catalytic converter failure can be costly, while transmission problems can affect the driving experience. Infotainment system glitches are also a relatively common complaint. Overall, while the Rio is a value-oriented car, potential buyers should be aware of these possible issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing or have it inspected by a trusted mechanic.
