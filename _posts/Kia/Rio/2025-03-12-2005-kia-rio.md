**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 (A6D)**

*   **Check Engine Light Due to Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, often accompanied by codes related to the oxygen sensors (e.g., P0131, P0137). May result in decreased fuel economy or failed emissions test.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor (upstream or downstream).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on sensor location and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Temperature Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine overheating, inaccurate temperature gauge readings, poor fuel economy, check engine light may illuminate (typically with a P0118 or P0119 code).
    *   Solution: Replace the coolant temperature sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, hard starting, or complete inability to start. Check engine light may illuminate with a code related to the crankshaft position sensor (e.g., P0335).
