The 2011 Kia Rio is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It came with two engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing 110 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter inline-4 diesel engine. The gasoline engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel was typically paired with a 5-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the Rio's good gas mileage and low price point. Common complaints include a somewhat underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded, and a basic interior lacking some of the features found in competing vehicles.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Out Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll during turns, longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (parts and labor for both front or both rear)

**Summary**

The 2011 Kia Rio, while generally reliable for its class, can experience a range of issues. Engine problems like oxygen sensor and catalytic converter failures are common. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can be costly to repair. Suspension components wear out over time, affecting ride quality. Electrical issues such as faulty window motors and battery drains are also reported. Most of these issues range from mild to moderate in severity, but can become more costly if left unattended. The overall cost to repair is average, but owners should be aware of these common problems when considering purchasing a used 2011 Kia Rio.
