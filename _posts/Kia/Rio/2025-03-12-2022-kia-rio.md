The 2022 Kia Rio is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and user-friendly technology. It is available as a sedan (4-door) or hatchback (5-door). The sole engine option is a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine producing 120 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People generally appreciate the Rio's value, maneuverability, and gas mileage. Common complaints often revolve around its somewhat basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and the sometimes-sluggish acceleration due to the CVT.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 GDI (G4FG)**

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling, particularly at low speeds or when coming to a stop. Others have mentioned hesitation or a lack of power during acceleration. This can potentially be related to fuel delivery issues or sensor malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is necessary to pinpoint the root cause. This could involve checking fuel injectors, sensors (such as the mass airflow sensor or oxygen sensors), and the throttle body. Potential fixes include cleaning or replacing faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the faulty component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than normal, low oil level warning lights, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: A qualified mechanic should perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of oil loss. Possible causes include worn piston rings or valve seals. Depending on the severity, the fix could range from using a thicker oil to replacing the piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough or jerky shifting, especially at lower speeds. The CVT might feel hesitant or struggle to find the optimal gear ratio, leading to an uneven driving experience.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the CVT may require more extensive diagnostics or even replacement if internal components are worn or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid change; $3,000 - $6,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported instances where the transmission seems to hesitate before engaging, particularly when accelerating from a stop or shifting from reverse to drive. This delay can be concerning and create unsafe driving situations.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is crucial. This may involve checking the transmission fluid level and condition, as well as inspecting the valve body and other internal components for signs of wear or damage. Possible solutions include a fluid flush, valve body repair, or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush; $500 - $1500 for valve body repair; $3,000 - $6,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (screen, radio, navigation, etc.) occasionally freezes or crashes, requiring a restart. This can be intermittent but frustrating, especially while driving.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealership might resolve the issue. If not, the infotainment unit itself could be faulty and require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update; $500 - $1500+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera display may intermittently fail to activate, show a distorted image, or display no image at all when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera wiring for damage or loose connections. If the wiring is intact, the camera unit itself may be faulty and require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for wiring repair; $200 - $500+ for camera replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation builds up inside the headlight housings. This can reduce headlight brightness and potentially damage the bulb or electrical components over time.
    *   Solution: Some owners drill a small drainage hole at the bottom of the headlight housing (at their own risk). The best solution is to replace the headlight housing with a properly sealed unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per headlight replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Vibrations from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling or vibrating noises coming from the dashboard area, especially when driving on rough roads or at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: This issue often requires careful inspection to identify the source of the noise. Common culprits include loose trim panels, wiring harnesses, or components behind the dashboard. A technician can secure or replace the offending parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the source and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Kia Rio, while generally reliable, can experience some common issues. Engine stalling and transmission jerkiness are the most concerning, potentially leading to more expensive repairs. Electrical issues such as infotainment glitches and backup camera malfunctions are also prevalent. Overall, while some repairs can be costly, many issues are relatively minor, and addressing them promptly can help maintain the Rio's dependability.
