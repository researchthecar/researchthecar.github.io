The 2017 Kia Soul EV is an all-electric hatchback known for its quirky styling, spacious interior, and relatively long (for its time) driving range. The 2017 Soul EV comes exclusively with an electric motor producing 109 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, paired with a single-speed transmission. People generally liked the Soul EV for its ease of use, practicality, and zero-emissions driving. Common complaints revolved around limited range (compared to newer EVs), long charging times, and availability (as it wasn't sold in all states).

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor (109 hp)**

*   **Reduced Maximum Battery Capacity Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in the battery's ability to hold a full charge, leading to a decreased driving range. The degradation rate can vary depending on usage, climate, and charging habits.
    *   Solution: While some battery degradation is normal, excessive degradation might warrant a battery replacement or cell replacement if cells can be replaced. Software updates in some cases can recalibrate the battery management system to more accurately reflect battery capacity, but this does not restore lost capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Replacement battery costs can vary but potentially upwards of $8,000 - $12,000+ installed depending on the service provider, core charge, and availability. Recalibration software updates may be covered under warranty or available for a nominal fee.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate state of charge (SOC) readings, premature charging cut-off, or failure to properly balance individual battery cells.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified EV technician. May involve software updates, replacement of the BMS module, or individual cell replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the specific issue and component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Single-Speed Transmission**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. May also cause increased tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers. It's recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ for parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Onboard Charger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to charge the vehicle using AC charging (Level 1 or Level 2 chargers). DC fast charging might still work, but AC charging is essential for home or workplace charging.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the onboard charger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ for parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Low Voltage (12V) Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature drain of the 12V battery, leading to starting issues, especially after the car has been sitting for an extended period. This is a common issue in EVs due to the reliance on the 12V system for various functions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic drain source. Could be a faulty module, improperly installed aftermarket accessory, or a failing 12V battery. Replacement of the 12V battery might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for a new 12V battery. Diagnosis of parasitic drain can add several hours of labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Charging Port Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The charging port door (the flap that covers the charging port) can become loose, difficult to open/close, or break entirely due to the spring mechanism wearing down or the plastic becoming brittle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the charging port door assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (navigation, radio, display) can freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available) may resolve some issues. In more severe cases, the entire infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue) to $500 - $1,500+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Kia Soul EV, while a solid electric vehicle for its time, has its share of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around battery degradation and onboard charger failures, which can lead to substantial repair costs. Other issues such as rear shock absorber failure, charging port door issues, and infotainment glitches are less severe but should be considered. Overall, potential buyers should pay close attention to the battery health and charging system during inspection and consider getting a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified EV technician. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem.
