The 2019 Kia Soul EV is a popular electric hatchback known for its boxy design, practicality, and relatively long range for its model year. It is powered by a 64 kWh battery pack paired with a 150 kW (201 hp) electric motor that generates 291 lb-ft of torque. People generally appreciate the Soul EV for its spacious interior, user-friendly technology, and nimble handling. Some common dislikes include the long charging times on standard chargers, limited availability outside of certain states, and the somewhat polarizing exterior styling.
