The 2015 Kia Soul EV is an all-electric subcompact hatchback known for its distinctive boxy design and practicality. The Soul EV only came with one powertrain option: a 27 kWh lithium-ion polymer battery pack paired with an 81 kW (109 hp) electric motor, producing 210 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Soul EV's roomy interior, comfortable ride, and nimble handling, making it a good choice for city driving. Some common complaints revolve around the limited driving range compared to newer EVs, battery degradation over time, and longer charging times with Level 1 charging.

**Electric Motor**

**81 kW Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced Maximum Power Output/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle enters "Turtle Mode" which severely limits power output. This can happen even with a decent amount of indicated battery charge remaining. Often accompanied by warning lights. This can be intermittent and clears when the vehicle is turned off and back on.
    *   Solution: Faulty or failing BMS (Battery Management System). Replacement of the BMS. A faulty connector can also be the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Voltage Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced range and capacity of the high voltage battery over time, particularly in hot climates. Faster than average degradation observed in some vehicles with higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Battery replacement. Some owners have had success with warranty claims depending on the battery's state of health and local regulations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **On-Board Charger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to charge the vehicle using AC charging (Level 1 or Level 2 chargers). DC fast charging might still work.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the on-board charger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorbers Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear shock absorbers leaking fluid, resulting in a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature draining of the 12V auxiliary battery, leading to starting problems or system malfunctions. Often attributed to software glitches or parasitic draws.
    *   Solution: Software update, replacement of the 12V battery, diagnosis and repair of parasitic draws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The charging port door failing to open or close properly. This can be due to a malfunctioning actuator or damage to the door itself.
    * Solution: Replacement of the charging port door actuator or repair of the door mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System/Infotainment Freezing or Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system becoming unresponsive, freezing, or crashing.
    *   Solution: Software update (if available), replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2015 Kia Soul EV presents owners with a mix of potential issues, with the most significant concerning the electric motor and battery system. High Voltage battery degradation can be a costly problem, potentially requiring expensive replacement. Electrical issues, while typically less expensive, can still be inconvenient. Suspension issues, such as leaking shock absorbers, are relatively common and pose safety concerns if not addressed. Overall, pre-purchase inspection focusing on battery health and electrical system functionality is highly recommended.
