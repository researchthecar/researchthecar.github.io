The 2002 Kia Magentis is a midsize sedan that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.4-liter inline-four that produced 140 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 2.7-liter V6 that produced 185 horsepower and 183 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Magentis was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price. However, it was also criticized for its lackluster performance and poor fuel economy.
