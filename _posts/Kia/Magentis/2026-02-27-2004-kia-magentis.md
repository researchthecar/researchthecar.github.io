### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Kia Magentis presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around age-related wear and tear, particularly with oil leaks from the engines, transmission shifting problems, and suspension components like ball joints and bushings. Electrical gremlins such as window regulators and alternators can also surface. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, owners should be aware of potential costs associated with these common issues. Regular maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission and timely replacement of the timing belt, is crucial for longevity.
