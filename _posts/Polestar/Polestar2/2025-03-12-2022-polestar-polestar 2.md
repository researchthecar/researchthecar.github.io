**Electric Motor**

**Single Motor**
*   **Reduced Power Warning/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances where the car suddenly enters a "reduced power" mode, often referred to as "turtle mode." This severely limits the vehicle's speed and acceleration. The dashboard displays a warning message indicating reduced power. In many cases, this occurs without any prior warning or obvious cause.
    *   Solution: The issue is often resolved by restarting the car, but it can reoccur. The underlying cause can vary, including software glitches, sensor issues, or even battery management system problems. Dealership diagnosis and software updates are typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the issue, Diagnosis is usually free while under warranty, but more extensive fixes can be $100 - $500+ depending on the specific part failure (sensor, software update).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Dual Motor**
*   **Reduced Power Warning/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances where the car suddenly enters a "reduced power" mode, often referred to as "turtle mode."

**Suspension**

*   **Harsh Ride Quality (Performance Pack/Aftermarket)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners who opt for the Performance Pack, which includes stiffer suspension components and larger wheels, sometimes complain about a harsh ride, particularly on rough or uneven roads. Some owners who install aftermarket lowering springs or coil overs also report a similar issue.
    *   Solution: The ride quality can be improved by switching to smaller wheels with tires that have a taller sidewall. Replacement of aftermarket coil overs with more forgiving options is another solution. Adjusting aftermarket coil overs to the softest setting is also a viable option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$2,000+ depending on aftermarket equipment installed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Software Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, powered by Google's Android Automotive OS, is prone to occasional glitches, including slow response times, app crashes, screen freezes, and connectivity issues (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi). These issues may cause navigation problems, audio disruptions, and difficulties with vehicle settings.
    *   Solution: Polestar frequently releases over-the-air (OTA) software updates to address these issues. Performing a system reset or a full factory reset can sometimes resolve persistent problems. In some cases, a dealer visit may be necessary for more complex troubleshooting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Mostly covered by OTA updates. Dealer visit is usually free under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 12V battery draining prematurely, leading to problems starting the car or accessing certain functions. This can be more common in vehicles that are not driven regularly or are frequently left in standby mode.
    *   Solution: The first step is to ensure all unnecessary accessories are turned off when the car is not in use. The dealer may need to diagnose for parasitic draw or replace the 12V battery if it's defective. Software updates can sometimes improve battery management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for battery replacement (may be covered under warranty).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Pilot Assist/Adaptive Cruise Control Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Pilot Assist (adaptive cruise control and lane keeping) system may experience occasional malfunctions, such as disengaging unexpectedly, providing erratic steering inputs, or failing to recognize lane markings. These malfunctions can pose a safety risk.
    *   Solution: The system might need recalibration, sensors may need cleaning or replacement, or a software update might be required to resolve the issue. The dealer can diagnose the cause and perform the necessary repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis and software updates may be covered under warranty. Sensor replacement can range from $500 - $1500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the charging port, including difficulty connecting the charging cable, the port failing to recognize the cable, or the charging process being interrupted. This can be caused by damage to the port, a faulty charging cable, or software glitches.
    *   Solution: Inspect the charging port for any visible damage or debris. Try using a different charging cable to rule out a cable issue. A software update or a replacement of the charging port may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Misalignment/Damage**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sensors are located in the front and rear bumpers. Many owners have reported damage to the sensors, causing parking assist to malfunction.
    * Solution: Sensor replacements from the dealer
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling or buzzing noises emanating from various areas of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or center console. These noises can be distracting and detract from the car's overall refinement.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise can be challenging. Dealership technicians may need to disassemble parts of the interior to locate and eliminate the source of the rattle or buzz. Applying felt tape, tightening loose screws, or replacing faulty clips can often resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Usually covered under warranty, but can range from $100 - $500+ for diagnosis and repair.
