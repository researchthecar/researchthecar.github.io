**Electric Motor**

**Single Motor**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Dual Motor**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Battery**

*   **Reduced Battery Capacity/Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a noticeable decrease in battery capacity and overall range over time, especially in colder climates or with frequent DC fast charging. The reported reduction varies but can be significant enough to impact daily usability.
    *   Solution: Dealers will typically perform a battery diagnostic check to assess the state of health (SOH) and identify any potential issues. If the battery is found to be outside of the specified degradation limits, warranty replacement or repair may be considered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Warranty covers for a specific time and mileage. Without warranty, battery replacements can be very costly ($10,000+).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

    *   Solution: Software updates from Polestar often address these issues. Performing a system reboot or factory reset can sometimes provide temporary relief. In some cases, hardware replacement of the central control unit (CCU) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Free with over-the-air updates. CCU replacement (if out of warranty) could range from $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the 12V battery draining prematurely, leading to a non-start condition or various electrical malfunctions.
    * Solution: Check the battery health and replace if necessary. Look for parasitic draws in the electrical system that could be causing the drain. Software updates can help optimize the 12V battery charging management system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for battery replacement. Diagnostic and repair of parasitic draw can vary widely ($100 - $500+).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Pixel LED Headlight Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with individual LEDs within the Pixel LED headlights failing or flickering, leading to reduced visibility and potentially failing safety inspections.
    *   Solution: The headlight assembly typically needs to be replaced as individual LEDs are not serviceable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ per headlight assembly (depending on location and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling and Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced various rattles and squeaks emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Locating and addressing the specific source of the noise requires careful diagnosis. Dealers may use specialized tools to dampen vibrations or tighten loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity and time required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Summary:**

The 2023 Polestar 2 generally receives positive reviews, but some owners have experienced issues primarily related to the infotainment system, electrical components, and interior build quality. The infotainment glitches, while often resolved through software updates, can be frustrating. 12V Battery issues and battery degradation are concerns for long-term owners, as well as costly fixes. Exterior issues with the Pixel LED headlights are expensive to fix and could lead to safety concerns. Addressing these potential issues during the shopping process can allow prospective buyers to make a more informed purchase decision.
