# 2021 Polestar Polestar 1

### Overview
The 2021 Polestar 1 is a limited-production plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) coupe that blends performance with luxury. As a halo model for the Polestar brand, it features a sophisticated powertrain and premium materials. Reliability data for such a low-volume, niche vehicle is less extensive than for mass-market cars. However, initial reports and the inherent complexity of its hybrid system suggest a focus on meticulous maintenance and specialized servicing. Owners generally report a high level of satisfaction, with the vehicle's advanced technology and performance being key highlights. The focus here is on potential issues arising from the unique hybrid architecture and high-performance components, rather than common automotive wear and tear.
