The 2021 Polestar 1 is a limited-production, high-performance plug-in hybrid coupe that combines a turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with two electric motors. This powertrain delivers a combined output of 619 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. The Polestar 1 uses an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its striking design, exceptional performance, and luxurious interior. Some common complaints include its high price, limited rear passenger space, and somewhat complex infotainment system.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor (Combined with 2.0L Turbocharged and Supercharged Engine)**
*   **High Voltage Coolant Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A "Reduced Propulsion" error message can appear on the dashboard. The heater helps maintain cabin temperature, so failure can result in poor heat output, especially in cold climates. Diagnostic codes may include those related to the high voltage coolant heater.
    *   Solution: Replacing the high voltage coolant heater, and updating software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission**
*   **Transmission Slipping/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing transmission slipping, particularly during acceleration or shifting between gears. This can manifest as delayed gear changes, a jerky feeling, or a noticeable lack of power delivery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is necessary. The solution could range from software recalibration to replacement of valve body or the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8,000+ (depending on the severity and required repairs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues (Android Automotive OS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or crashing of the infotainment system are common complaints. Connectivity problems (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi), navigation glitches, and unresponsive touch screen behavior are also reported.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the primary method for addressing these issues. In some cases, a full system reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software updates) to $2,000+ (replacement of the unit).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature drain of the 12V battery, leading to starting problems. This can be caused by software glitches that prevent modules from properly shutting down or excessive parasitic drain.
    *   Solution: Performing a diagnostic check to pinpoint the cause of the drain. Software updates can often resolve parasitic drain issues. Replacement of the battery may be needed if it has been damaged by repeated discharge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning sensors can affect systems like adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, and parking assist. Symptoms include error messages, erratic system behavior, or complete system failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a diagnostic tool to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling and creaking noises emanating from various areas of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck.

**Summary**

The 2021 Polestar 1, while a technologically advanced and visually striking vehicle, has experienced a few notable issues. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system and 12V battery, seem to be relatively common. Some owners have also reported transmission issues, which can be a costly repair. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences that can be addressed with software updates to more significant mechanical problems requiring component replacement. While Polestar offers warranty coverage, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor them into their purchasing decision.
