# 2020 Polestar Polestar 1

### Overview
The 2020 Polestar Polestar 1 is a high-performance plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that blends a powerful gasoline engine with electric motors. As a limited-production, halo model, its reliability data is less extensive than mass-market vehicles. However, initial reports and the inherent complexity of its powertrain suggest a focus on specialized maintenance. The vehicle's advanced technology, including its hybrid system and performance-oriented chassis, means that while core components are generally robust, potential issues may arise from the integration of these complex systems. Owners should expect a premium ownership experience with a need for qualified technicians for servicing.
