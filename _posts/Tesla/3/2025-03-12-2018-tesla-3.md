The 2018 Tesla Model 3 was a pivotal vehicle for the company, representing a more affordable and mass-market entry into the electric vehicle space. The Standard Range Plus model features a single rear-mounted electric motor producing around 271 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. A Long Range model with dual motors for all-wheel drive provides significantly more power and range. Owners generally praise the Model 3 for its quick acceleration, minimalist interior design, advanced technology features (like Autopilot), and relatively long range compared to other EVs of its time. Common criticisms include build quality inconsistencies, reliance on the touchscreen for many functions, and occasional service delays.

**Summary**
The 2018 Tesla Model 3, while groundbreaking, has exhibited a range of issues. The most significant problems revolve around the electric motors, battery pack degradation, and electrical components (touchscreen, MCU). These can lead to expensive repairs. Suspension and exterior issues, while less critical, are also common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major functional failures. While some issues can be addressed with software updates, many require costly component replacements. A thorough inspection of the vehicle's service history and a pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended when considering a used 2018 Model 3.
