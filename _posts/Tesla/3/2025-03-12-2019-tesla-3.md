The 2019 Tesla Model 3 is an all-electric sedan that gained popularity for its performance, technology, and relatively affordable price point within the EV market. Available initially in Standard Range, Mid Range, Long Range, and Performance trims, it offered varying levels of battery capacity and performance. The Long Range models featured a dual-motor all-wheel drive system and a battery pack providing approximately 310 miles of range. While praised for its sleek design, rapid acceleration (the Performance trim can reach 0-60 mph in around 3.2 seconds), and advanced Autopilot system, some owners have reported concerns about build quality, panel gaps, and certain electrical glitches. There is no engine to speak of, as the vehicle is an all electric vehicle. It also features a single speed transmission which is considered a single speed gearbox.

**Electric Motor**

**Long Range Dual Motor**

* **Motor Stator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported complete motor failure, often preceded by warning messages or unusual noises. The vehicle may lose power and become immobile.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected electric motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+

* **Reduced Power/AWD Unavailable**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report instances where the car displays a "Reduced Power" or "AWD Unavailable" message, limiting performance and disabling all-wheel drive. This can be caused by a faulty inverter, motor, or sensor.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to determine the faulty component (inverter, motor, sensor) and subsequent replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $6,000 depending on the failed part.

**Single Speed Transmission**

* **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Upper Control Arm Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the front upper control arms, leading to clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and alignment issues. This issue seems more prevalent in colder climates.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected upper control arms, followed by a wheel alignment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per side

**Electrical**

* **12V Battery Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery, used to power various systems, can fail prematurely, leading to error messages, inability to start the car, and loss of functionality of certain features.
    * Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

* **Touchscreen Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The central touchscreen, which controls almost all vehicle functions, can freeze, lag, or crash, leading to loss of access to climate control, navigation, and other essential features.
    * Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. If not, the media control unit (MCU) may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $2,000+ (MCU Replacement)

* **Charging Port Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Charging port malfunctions, including inability to open the port, failure to initiate charging, or intermittent charging.
    * Solution: Inspection and possible replacement of the charging port assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+

**Exterior**

* **Panel Alignment/Gaps**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent panel alignment and larger-than-expected gaps between body panels, especially around the trunk, hood, and doors.
    * Solution: Adjustment of the body panels to improve alignment. This is more of a cosmetic issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly. Sometimes addressed under warranty, otherwise $100 - $500+ depending on the extent of the misalignment.

* **Tail Light Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulating inside the tail light housings, potentially affecting visibility and long-term light functionality.
    * Solution: Replacement of the tail light housings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**Interior**

* **Seat Discomfort/Poor Support**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained about the seat comfort, particularly on longer drives, citing inadequate lumbar support or an uncomfortable seat base.
    * Solution: Aftermarket seat cushions or professional seat modifications.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+

* **Rattling/Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from various areas of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or headliner.
    * Solution: Identification of the source of the noise and tightening of loose components or application of sound-deadening materials.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Summary**

The 2019 Tesla Model 3, while innovative and technologically advanced, exhibits a range of issues. Suspension and electrical problems are the most common and can potentially be costly to fix. Build quality issues, particularly related to panel alignment, are prevalent but primarily cosmetic. Motor failures are the most severe issue and can cost upward of $5,000 to fix.
