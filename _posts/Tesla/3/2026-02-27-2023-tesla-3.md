# 2023 Tesla 3

### Overview
The 2023 Tesla Model 3, an all-electric sedan, has generally demonstrated strong reliability, building on Tesla's reputation for innovative automotive technology. As an electric vehicle, it inherently benefits from fewer moving parts compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, particularly in its powertrain. This translates to fewer mechanical failures related to engines and transmissions. However, like any complex vehicle, some areas require attention. The electrical system, due to its extensive integration of software and hardware, can occasionally present issues. The battery pack, while designed for longevity, is a significant component where long-term degradation is a consideration, though widespread premature failure is not a common report for this model year. Overall, the Model 3 offers a robust ownership experience with a focus on advanced technology and efficient electric propulsion.
