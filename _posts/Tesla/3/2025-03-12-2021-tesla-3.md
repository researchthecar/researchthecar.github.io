**Electric Motor**

**Long Range (Dual Motor)**
*   **Drive Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported complete drive motor failure, resulting in loss of propulsion. Symptoms include error messages on the touchscreen indicating a motor malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected drive motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $7,000+ (depending on location and shop)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Standard Range Plus (Single Motor)**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Battery**

**All Models**
*   **Reduced Range Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in maximum battery range over several years of use. This is a normal characteristic of lithium-ion batteries, but some owners report larger than expected degradation.
    *   Solution: Battery health is managed by the Battery Management System. While some degradation is expected, a significant loss may warrant inspection by Tesla. Replacement is an option, but expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A for battery health management; $15,000 - $20,000+ for full battery replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Cooling System Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the battery pack, leading to overheating and potential performance issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty cooling lines or resealing the battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, used to power auxiliary systems, can fail prematurely, leading to a no-start condition or various electrical glitches.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery. Tesla has switched to Lithium Ion 12V batteries which generally last longer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Touchscreen Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central touchscreen can experience freezing, lag, or complete failure.
