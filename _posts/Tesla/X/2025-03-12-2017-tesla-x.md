Owners generally appreciate the Model X for its quick acceleration, spacious interior, and access to Tesla's Supercharger network. Criticisms often focus on build quality issues, reliability problems, and the high cost of repairs.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Electric Motor (All Trims)**

* **Drive Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature drive unit failure, resulting in a loss of power, unusual noises (whining, grinding), or complete motor failure. This can happen in either the front or rear drive unit.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected drive unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks from Battery Pack**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the battery pack can lead to overheating and reduced battery performance. Leaks are often reported around fittings and connections.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty coolant lines or resealing of connections. In some cases, battery pack replacement may be necessary if damage is extensive.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $15,000+ depending on the severity

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can fail, leading to the vehicle sagging on one or more corners, a rough ride, or the inability to adjust ride height. This can be due to a faulty air compressor, leaking air struts, or a malfunctioning air suspension control module.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air compressor, individual air struts, or the control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,000 for compressor replacement, $300 - $800 for control module.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **MCU (Media Control Unit) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The MCU controls the central touchscreen, navigation, climate control, and other essential functions. Failures can manifest as a blank screen, freezing, slow response times, or complete system shutdown. The eMMC memory chip is prone to failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the MCU, often upgraded to a newer version with improved hardware.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **12V Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the 12V auxiliary battery, leading to issues with starting the vehicle, accessing the touchscreen, and other electrical functions.
    * Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Handle Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The retractable door handles can fail to deploy or retract properly, leading to difficulties opening and closing the doors. This can be caused by motor failure, sensor issues, or mechanical binding.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door handle assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per handle
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Falcon Wing Door Issues**
