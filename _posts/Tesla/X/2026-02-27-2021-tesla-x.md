### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Tesla Model X generally demonstrates good reliability, particularly in its electric powertrain, which lacks the complexity of internal combustion engines. However, owners have reported some recurring issues. The adaptive air suspension can be prone to leaks or component failures, leading to ride height problems and potential repair costs. Electrically, the infotainment system's touchscreen can occasionally freeze or become unresponsive, often resolvable with software updates but sometimes requiring hardware intervention. The 12V auxiliary battery has also been noted for premature failure in some instances, impacting various vehicle functions. The unique Falcon Wing Doors, while a signature feature, can also experience mechanical malfunctions. Despite these points, the core electric drivetrain remains robust. Regular software updates and addressing suspension and electrical quirks are key to maintaining optimal reliability for the 2021 Model X.
