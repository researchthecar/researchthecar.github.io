The 2019 Tesla Model X is an all-electric SUV known for its distinctive falcon-wing doors, impressive acceleration, and advanced technology. It came with various battery pack options offering different ranges and performance levels. The Long Range model, a popular choice, boasts all-wheel drive and produces over 500 horsepower and over 400 lb-ft of torque. Some owners praise its spaciousness, tech features, and quick acceleration, while others have expressed concerns about build quality, reliability, and service costs.

**Electric Motor**

**Long Range/Performance**

*   **Drive Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The drive unit, which combines the motor, inverter, and gearbox, can fail prematurely. Symptoms include a loss of power, error messages on the display, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire drive unit is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur within the electric motor cooling system, especially at fittings and hoses. This can lead to overheating and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking hoses or fittings and top off the coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

**Long Range/Performance**

*   **Reduced Battery Capacity/Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual degradation of the battery pack over time is expected. However, some owners have reported experiencing more significant range loss than anticipated, especially in extreme temperatures.
    *   Solution: While some capacity loss is normal, significant drops may require battery module replacement or, in rare cases, complete battery pack replacement. Software updates can sometimes help optimize battery management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $20,000+ (depending on the extent of replacement needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The BMS, which monitors and controls the battery, can experience glitches or failures. Symptoms include inaccurate state-of-charge readings, charging problems, and error messages.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often the first step. If the issue persists, BMS module replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Charging System**

**All Trims**

*   **Onboard Charger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The onboard charger, which converts AC power from a charging station or wall outlet to DC power for the battery, can fail. Symptoms include the car not charging or charging very slowly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the onboard charger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**All Trims**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor, responsible for maintaining the vehicle's ride height, can fail. Symptoms include the car sagging, especially overnight, and error messages related to the suspension system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air leaks can develop in the air suspension struts, leading to ride height issues, a bumpy ride, and compressor overwork.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**All Trims**

*   **MCU (Media Control Unit) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MCU controls the central touchscreen display and various vehicle functions. Failure can result in a blank screen, loss of access to controls (climate, navigation, etc.), and connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MCU. This was a more prevalent issue on older Model S/X vehicles with the Tegra-based MCU1. The 2019 Model X typically has the Intel Atom-based MCU2, which is more reliable, but failures can still occur.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Despite being an EV, the Model X relies on a 12V battery for certain functions. Premature failure of this battery can cause various electrical issues, including the car not starting or accessories not working.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Handle Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The auto-presenting door handles can fail to extend or retract properly, especially in cold weather. This can be due to frozen mechanisms or electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Lubrication, cleaning, or replacement of the door handle assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per handle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
