**Summary**

The 2020 Tesla Model Y is known for its performance and technology, but also suffers from a range of quality control issues. The most severe potential problems involve the drive unit failure and premature battery degradation, which can be very expensive to repair out of warranty. Other issues such as infotainment problems, suspension noise, and exterior fit and finish concerns are more common and may require multiple visits to a service center. While many of these issues may be covered under warranty, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems.
