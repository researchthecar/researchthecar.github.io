The 2021 Tesla Model Y is an all-electric compact SUV, available in several configurations including Long Range and Performance models. The Long Range model delivers approximately 353 miles of range, while the Performance version offers quicker acceleration. Horsepower varies depending on the configuration, with the Performance model boasting upwards of 450 hp. Torque also varies, with the Performance variant delivering substantial instant torque for rapid acceleration. Owners generally appreciate the Model Y's spacious interior, advanced technology features (such as Autopilot), and impressive electric range. However, some common complaints include build quality inconsistencies, panel gaps, and occasional software glitches.

**Electric Motor**

**Long Range / Performance Dual Motor**

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in battery capacity over time, leading to decreased range. The amount of degradation varies based on charging habits, climate, and driving style.
    *   Solution: Tesla typically warranties the battery for a specific period/mileage, and significant degradation beyond a certain threshold may be covered under warranty. Replacing the battery is a costly option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement can range from $12,000 - $20,000+ depending on battery size and location.

*   **HV Battery Contactors Sticking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to charge or drive the vehicle. Error messages related to the high voltage battery system are displayed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HV battery contactors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car is completely dead or unresponsive. Error messages may appear on the screen before the battery fails completely. This battery is used to power the low voltage systems in the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery. Some owners choose to upgrade to lithium-ion aftermarket batteries.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

*   **Infotainment Screen Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central touchscreen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or reboots unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Attempt a soft reset (holding down both steering wheel buttons). If the problem persists, a firmware update or hardware replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are generally free. Hardware replacement can range from $500 - $2,000+ depending on the specific component.

*   **Phantom Braking (Autopilot)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Autopilot or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) suddenly applies the brakes for no apparent reason, even when there are no obstacles in the vehicle's path.
    *   Solution: Disable Autopilot/TACC when the issue occurs. Tesla has released software updates to address this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are generally free.

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Suspension Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report needing to replace control arms, ball joints, or other suspension components earlier than expected. Noises (clunking, creaking) from the suspension may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per corner, depending on the specific components replaced and labor costs.

**Exterior**

*   **Panel Gaps and Misalignment**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven gaps between body panels, doors, hood, and trunk. Misaligned panels may also be noticeable.
    *   Solution: Adjustment or replacement of body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This is often covered under warranty if reported early. Otherwise, repair costs can range from $100 - $500+ per panel.

*   **Tail Light Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the tail light housings, causing condensation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the tail light assembly. Some owners try to seal the housings themselves, but this is not always effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per tail light.

**Interior**

*   **Seat Discoloration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The white seats in the interior of the vehicle have discoloration from dye from jeans and other clothing.
    *   Solution: Thorough cleaning of the seats with cleaning products designed for the Tesla seats.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100+

*   **Rattling and Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling sounds from the dashboard, doors, seats, or other interior components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and tightening loose components, applying felt tape to prevent friction between parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This can range from a DIY fix to $100 - $500+ at a service center, depending on the complexity.

**Recalls:**

*   **21V-977:** Front Suspension Lateral Link Detachment
*   **21V-673:** Suspension Lateral Link Separation
*   **21V-596:** Seat Belt May Not Be Secured Properly
*   **21V-413:** Front Suspension Knuckle Fracture
*   **21V-142:** Center Display Touch Screen Failure
*   **21V-032:** Backup Camera Software Error

**Summary**
The 2021 Tesla Model Y has a mix of issues. Common issues relate to battery degradation and electrical components. Build quality issues also arise such as panel gaps and misalignments. Suspension issues may require repair or replacement. While software glitches can often be resolved with updates, hardware failures can be more costly. Battery-related problems remain the most expensive to address.
