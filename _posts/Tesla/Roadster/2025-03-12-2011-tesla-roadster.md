The 2011 Tesla Roadster is an all-electric sports car that was among the first commercially successful electric vehicles. It's powered by an AC induction motor paired with a single-speed transmission. The Roadster boasts around 288 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Owners love the Roadster for its unique design, quick acceleration, and zero-emission driving. Criticisms often center around its limited range compared to newer EVs, its aging battery packs, and the cost of maintaining a relatively low-production vehicle.

**Electric Motor**

**AC Induction Motor**

*   **Motor Stator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced performance, motor overheating, and eventual failure. The car might display a "Motor Fault" error.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the motor stator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Electronics Module (PEM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The PEM controls the power flow to the motor. Failure can result in loss of power, inability to charge, or complete vehicle shutdown.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the PEM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Single-Speed Transmission**
*   **Gearbox Whine/Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive whirring or grinding noise emanating from the gearbox, especially at higher speeds. This may indicate wear or damage to the gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the gearbox.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Battery Degradation/Reduced Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in driving range compared to original specifications. Battery cells lose capacity over time, impacting overall performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebalancing the battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $15,000 - $30,000+ (depending on the extent of the degradation and if replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The BMS monitors and controls battery health. Failure can lead to charging issues, inaccurate range estimations, or even complete battery shutdown.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the BMS.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Suspension Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the Roadster's age and sporty suspension setup, components like ball joints, bushings, and shock absorbers can wear out, leading to diminished handling, increased noise, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the number of components needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, used for auxiliary systems, can drain quickly, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can prevent the car from starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery, or investigation of parasitic drains.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for battery replacement), $200+ (for diagnosing parasitic drains)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Common issues include blower motor failure and compressor issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty HVAC components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Replacement or resealing of the headlight housings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per headlight
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The aging infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the infotainment system. Note: replacement options may be limited.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Tesla Roadster, while revolutionary, is showing its age. The most significant concerns revolve around battery degradation, which leads to reduced range and costly replacements. Electrical and motor issues are also prevalent and can be expensive to repair. Suspension wear is typical for a sports car of this vintage. While many issues are not widespread, the Roadster's low production numbers and specialized components make repairs more costly than for mainstream vehicles. Potential buyers should factor in these potential expenses when considering a purchase.
