The 2008 Tesla Roadster marked Tesla's entry into the automotive market, combining electric vehicle technology with sports car styling. Powered by an electric motor producing around 248 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, the Roadster offered brisk acceleration and a revolutionary driving experience for its time. Owners often praised its performance and innovative nature. Common dislikes included the limited range compared to modern EVs, battery degradation over time, and the higher maintenance costs associated with its unique powertrain.

**Electric Motor**

**AC Induction Motor**

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual loss of battery capacity over time, leading to reduced range and performance. This is a natural characteristic of lithium-ion batteries, but can be accelerated by frequent deep discharges or extreme temperatures.
    *   Solution: Battery replacement or reconditioning. Battery replacement costs can vary significantly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $12,000 - $40,000+ (depending on battery pack condition and replacement options)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Drive Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The drive inverter converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor. Failure can result in reduced power, limp mode, or complete failure to start.
    *   Solution: Inverter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Suspension Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension components such as ball joints, control arm bushings, and shocks can wear out over time, leading to diminished handling, increased noise, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Roadster uses a 12V battery to power auxiliary systems. These batteries are prone to failure, especially if the car sits unused for extended periods. Symptoms include difficulty starting, warning lights, and system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: 12V battery replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Touchscreen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central touchscreen controls many vehicle functions. Failures can include unresponsiveness, flickering, or complete blackout.
    *   Solution: Touchscreen replacement or repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Wiring harnesses can degrade over time, leading to shorts, open circuits, and intermittent electrical problems. This can affect various systems, from lights to the motor controller.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of affected wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and location of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The convertible top mechanism can experience failures, leading to difficulty opening or closing the top, leaks, and damage to the fabric.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the top mechanism or fabric.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system can fail due to refrigerant leaks, compressor failure, or issues with the climate control system.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Tesla Roadster, while groundbreaking, is now an aging vehicle with several common issues. The most significant is battery degradation, which can lead to costly replacement or reconditioning. Electrical issues, suspension wear, and convertible top malfunctions are also prevalent. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making careful inspection and maintenance crucial for Roadster owners.
