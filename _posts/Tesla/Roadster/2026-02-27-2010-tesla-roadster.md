## Engine

### Electric Powertrain (AC Induction Motor)
**Battery Pack Degradation**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced range, slower charging times, decreased overall performance.
- **Solution:** Battery pack refurbishment or replacement (expensive).
- **Cost:** $10,000 - $40,000+

**Inverter Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of power, 'check engine' or powertrain warning lights, vehicle may not move.
- **Solution:** Inverter replacement.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $5,000

**Onboard Charger Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Failure to charge, intermittent charging issues, error messages on the dashboard.
- **Solution:** Onboard charger repair or replacement.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,000


## Transmission

### Single-Speed Gearbox
**Gearbox Bearing Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Whining or grinding noises from the transmission, especially under acceleration or deceleration.
- **Solution:** Gearbox bearing replacement or gearbox rebuild.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $3,000


## Suspension

### Double Wishbone Suspension
**Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, reduced handling precision, visible fluid leaks from shock absorbers.
- **Solution:** Shock absorber replacement.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,200

**Bushings Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, imprecise steering, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn suspension bushings.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800


## Electrical

### 12V Auxiliary Battery
**Premature Failure**

### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Tesla Roadster, while a pioneering electric vehicle, exhibits reliability concerns primarily centered around its unique electric powertrain components. The battery pack is the most significant potential expense, with degradation being a common issue over time. Inverters and onboard chargers can also fail, leading to costly repairs. Beyond the electrics, the single-speed gearbox can develop bearing issues, and suspension components like shock absorbers and bushings are subject to wear. Electrical systems, particularly the 12V auxiliary battery and infotainment, can also present problems. Exterior and interior components generally fare better, with fewer reported widespread issues. Prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for high repair costs, especially concerning the battery and powertrain.
