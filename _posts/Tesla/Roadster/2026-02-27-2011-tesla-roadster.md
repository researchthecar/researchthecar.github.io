## Engine

### Electric Powertrain (Dual Motor)
**Battery Degradation**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced range, slower charging times, loss of overall power.
- **Solution:** Battery pack replacement or refurbishment (often expensive).
- **Cost:** $10,000 - $20,000+

**Inverter Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of power, "check powertrain" warning lights, vehicle may not move.
- **Solution:** Inverter replacement.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $5,000

**Gearbox/Transmission Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Whining noises, difficulty shifting, loss of drive.
- **Solution:** Transmission repair or replacement.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $4,000


## Transmission

### Single-Speed Gearbox
**Sealing Ring Leakage**
- **Symptoms:** Fluid leaks from the gearbox, potential for low fluid levels leading to increased wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of sealing rings.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**No Major Issues**
- **Symptoms:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Solution:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Cost:** No widespread issues reported.


## Electrical

### 12V Battery
**Premature Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical systems malfunctioning (lights, infotainment, door locks), difficulty starting.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the 12V auxiliary battery.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


### Infotainment System
**Screen Glitches/Freezing**
- **Symptoms:** Touchscreen becomes unresponsive, display freezes, audio issues.

### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Tesla Roadster, while a pioneering electric vehicle, exhibits some reliability concerns primarily centered around its unique electric powertrain components, particularly the battery pack and inverter. These can represent significant repair costs. The 12V auxiliary battery is also a common point of failure. Other areas like suspension, exterior, and most interior components are generally reliable. Owners should be prepared for potential battery degradation and associated costs, as well as the possibility of inverter or gearbox issues. Regular diagnostics and prompt attention to warning lights are recommended.
