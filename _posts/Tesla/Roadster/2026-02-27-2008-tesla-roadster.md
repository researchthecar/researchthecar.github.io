## Engine

### Electric Powertrain
**Battery Degradation**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced range, slower charging times, decreased overall performance.
- **Solution:** Battery pack replacement or refurbishment (expensive). Tesla has offered battery upgrades over time.
- **Cost:** $5,000 - $20,000+

**Inverter/Motor Controller Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of power, 'check powertrain' warning lights, vehicle may not move.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the inverter or motor controller unit.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $4,000


## Transmission

### Single-Speed Gearbox
**Gearbox Bearing Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Whining or grinding noises from the transmission, potential for complete failure.
- **Solution:** Transmission rebuild or replacement.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $5,000


## Suspension

### Lotus-derived Chassis
**Front Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn bushings.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700


## Electrical

### 12V Auxiliary Battery
**Premature Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical gremlins, infotainment system issues, difficulty starting (even with a charged main battery).
- **Solution:** Replacement of the 12V battery.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300


### Infotainment System
**Screen Glitches/Freezing**
- **Symptoms:** Touchscreen unresponsive, display errors, system reboots.
- **Solution:** Software updates, potential screen replacement.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,500


## Exterior

### Body Panels
**Carbon Fiber Panel Fitment**
- **Symptoms:** Minor gaps or misalignments between panels, especially on early models.
- **Solution:** Adjustment or minor repair by a specialist.
- **Cost:** $100 - $300


## Interior

### Seat Upholstery
**Wear on Bolsters**
- **Symptoms:** Cracking or tearing on the side bolsters of the seats due to ingress/egress.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of seat covers.
- **Cost:** $400 - $1,000 per seat

### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Tesla Roadster is a unique and exciting vehicle, but its pioneering status means potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The electric powertrain, particularly the battery pack, is the most significant area for potential high-cost repairs. Issues with the inverter, single-speed gearbox, and 12V auxiliary battery are also documented. Beyond the powertrain, suspension components and interior wear are common considerations. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, the Roadster requires diligent maintenance and a willingness to address the specific challenges of an early-production, high-performance electric car. Its value proposition hinges on passion for the marque and a realistic understanding of its potential upkeep costs.
