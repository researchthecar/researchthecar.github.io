# 2019 Tesla S

### Overview
The 2019 Tesla Model S, an all-electric luxury sedan, is generally recognized for its advanced technology and performance. As an electric vehicle, its reliability profile differs significantly from internal combustion engine cars, with fewer mechanical components prone to wear. Key areas of focus for reliability data include the electric powertrain (battery, motors), software systems, and the vehicle's unique features. While the core electric drivetrain is robust, potential issues can arise from software glitches, charging system components, and the high-voltage battery pack over extended periods. Owners often report satisfaction with the driving experience and the innovative features, but like any complex vehicle, occasional electronic or hardware concerns can surface.

### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Tesla Model S demonstrates strong reliability in its core electric powertrain, with electric motors and transmissions generally performing without significant issues. The primary concerns tend to revolve around the high-voltage battery pack's long-term degradation and potential cell failures, as well as the 12V auxiliary battery's lifespan. Electrical systems, particularly the infotainment and charging components, can occasionally experience glitches or failures requiring attention. Suspension issues, specifically with the air suspension system, are also noted. Overall, while the Model S offers a technologically advanced and generally dependable ownership experience, owners should be aware of potential costs associated with battery and electrical system repairs outside of warranty.
