The 2012 Tesla Model S was a groundbreaking electric vehicle, offering impressive range and performance for its time. Available initially with a 85 kWh battery pack, it boasted approximately 362 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque (depending on the specific motor configuration). Early adopters loved its futuristic design, rapid acceleration, and the promise of emission-free driving. However, some common complaints revolved around early build quality issues, battery degradation, and the then-nascent charging infrastructure.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Motor (Rear-Wheel Drive)**
*   **Drive Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the drive unit (motor and gearbox assembly) is a known issue. Symptoms include loud whining or grinding noises, reduced power, and eventual complete failure. The original Gen 1 drive units were particularly prone to this.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire drive unit. Updated drive unit designs (Gen 2 and later) are more reliable but costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery Pack**

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual loss of battery capacity over time, resulting in reduced range. This is a natural characteristic of lithium-ion batteries, but some 2012 Model S owners experienced more rapid degradation than expected. Factors like charging habits, climate, and usage patterns influence degradation rates.
    *   Solution: There is no cost-effective solution to reverse battery degradation. Software updates can sometimes help to manage the battery's health, but ultimately, replacement of the battery pack is the only permanent fix. Tesla offered battery replacements or refurbished batteries for a significant cost.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $20,000+ (depending on battery size and availability)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2012 Model S vehicles experienced complete battery pack failures prematurely, often due to internal cell failures or issues with the battery management system (BMS). Symptoms include sudden loss of range, inability to charge, and error messages.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $20,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can experience compressor failures, leading to the car sitting low or unevenly. Noises are common before a failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MCU (Media Control Unit) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MCU controls the central touchscreen display, navigation, climate control, and other vehicle functions. Failure can manifest as a blank screen, slow performance, or complete system malfunction. Early MCUs with the Tegra processor are prone to this.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MCU. Tesla offered an MCU upgrade to a faster Intel Atom-based unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, used to power auxiliary systems, can fail prematurely. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car (even though the main battery is charged), error messages, and malfunctioning accessories.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The flush-mounted door handles, a defining design feature, are known to fail. They can become stuck, making it difficult to open the doors, especially in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door handle mechanism. Redesigned door handles are available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+ per handle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroofs are known to leak or break.
    *   Solution: Usually requires replacement of the entire sunroof assembly, but could be as simple as a clogged drain line.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800- $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Center Console Screen Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The coating on the center console screen can bubble or separate from the glass causing delamination.
    *   Solution: Requires screen replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000-$2000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2012 Tesla Model S, while innovative, is prone to several issues. The most concerning are the potential for drive unit and battery pack failures, which are both expensive to repair. MCU failure, air suspension problems, and door handle issues are also relatively common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. While many of these issues have been addressed in later model years, potential buyers should be aware of these risks and factor them into their purchasing decision. The severity of these issues ranges from inconvenient (door handles) to potentially immobilizing (battery failure). Repair costs can be substantial, making thorough pre-purchase inspection and consideration of extended warranties advisable.
