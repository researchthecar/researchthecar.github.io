The 2016 Tesla Model S is an all-electric luxury sedan that boasts impressive performance and range. It came in several configurations including the 70, 70D, 75, 75D, 90D, and P90D, all with different battery sizes and performance characteristics. For example, the P90D, with its performance enhancements, could reach 0-60 mph in under 3 seconds with "Ludicrous Mode" activated. Horsepower ranged from around 315 hp to over 500 hp depending on the model. People love the Model S for its instant torque, advanced technology (like Autopilot), and long-range capabilities, which significantly reduce range anxiety compared to earlier EVs. Common dislikes include concerns about long-term battery degradation, expensive repairs, and occasional build quality issues.
