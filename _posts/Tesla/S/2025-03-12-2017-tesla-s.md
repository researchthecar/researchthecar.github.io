The 2017 Tesla Model S is a fully electric luxury sedan known for its impressive acceleration, long range, and advanced technology. In 2017, several powertrain options were available, including the 75D, 90D, and 100D, with horsepower ranging from around 328 hp to over 500 hp depending on the configuration. The Model S is praised for its minimalist interior, quick charging capabilities, and Autopilot driver-assistance system. However, some common criticisms include build quality issues, expensive repairs, and reliance on Tesla's proprietary charging network.
