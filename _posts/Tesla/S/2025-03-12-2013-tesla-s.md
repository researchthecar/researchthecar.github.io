The 2013 Tesla Model S was a groundbreaking electric vehicle that offered impressive range, performance, and technology for its time. It was available with multiple battery pack options, including 60 kWh, 85 kWh, and later, a performance-oriented P85 version. The P85 offered impressive acceleration, with around 416 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque, making it a favorite among enthusiasts. Owners often praise the Model S for its smooth and quiet operation, instant torque, and advanced features. However, common complaints include concerns about battery degradation over time, reliability issues with some components, and the cost of repairs.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Motor (All Models)**

*   **Drive Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises, reduced power, complete drive unit failure. The earlier drive units (typically those produced before mid-2015) are more susceptible to failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire drive unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery Pack**

**All Battery Pack Options (60 kWh, 85 kWh)**

*   **Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in maximum range over time. This is a normal characteristic of lithium-ion batteries, but some owners have experienced more significant degradation than expected.
    *   Solution: There is no real solution, as this is normal degradation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden and unexpected battery failure.
    *   Solution: Battery replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $12,000 - $20,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Air Suspension (Optional)**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Suspension not lifting or lowering correctly, error messages on the dashboard, noisy compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one corner, especially overnight. Hissing sound coming from the air strut.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car will not start, error messages on the dashboard, accessories not working. Unlike traditional cars, the 12V battery is used for powering the electronics and "waking up" the car, so its failure can be problematic.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Touchscreen Failure (MCU1)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slow response, freezing, black screen, loss of functionality (climate control, navigation, etc.). This is a well-known issue with the older MCU1 units in early Model S vehicles.
    *   Solution: Replacement or upgrade of the Media Control Unit (MCU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500+ for MCU replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door handle failing to present, getting stuck, or not retracting properly.
    *   Solution: Door handle replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$800+ per handle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **eMMC Memory Failure (MCU1)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Degraded performance of the infotainment system, eventually leading to complete failure. Data logging and other critical functions may be affected. Related to the MCU1 issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the eMMC memory chip or upgrading the entire MCU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400 for chip replacement. $2,500+ for MCU replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin through the sunroof area, staining the headliner.
    *   Solution: Resealing or replacing the sunroof.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight housings or attempting to reseal them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per headlight
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rear Door Latch Cable Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear doors unable to be opened from the inside.
    *   Solution: Cable replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500 per door.
    *   Recalls: Recall NTSB #17V027000

**Summary:**

The 2013 Tesla Model S, while innovative, can suffer from various issues. The most significant problems revolve around the drive unit, battery pack degradation and potential failure, and touchscreen malfunctions (MCU1). Air suspension issues are also relatively common. The cost of repairs can be substantial, particularly for battery and drive unit replacements.
