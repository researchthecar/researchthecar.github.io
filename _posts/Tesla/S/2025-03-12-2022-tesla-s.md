The 2022 Tesla Model S is a high-performance electric vehicle known for its rapid acceleration, long range, and advanced technology. It's available in several configurations, including the Long Range, Plaid, and Plaid+. While the Plaid+ was eventually cancelled before production, the other two trims remain. The Long Range model boasts an impressive range and acceleration, while the Plaid takes performance to another level with its tri-motor setup. The Plaid configuration delivers over 1,000 horsepower and over 1,000 lb-ft of torque, enabling it to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in around 2 seconds. Owners generally praise the Model S for its performance, technology, and minimalist interior design. Criticisms often center around build quality issues, long repair times, and Tesla's service network.
