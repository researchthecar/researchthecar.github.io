### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Tesla Model S generally exhibits good reliability, particularly in its electric powertrain which has fewer moving parts than traditional internal combustion engines. The most significant potential concerns revolve around the high-voltage battery pack, which can experience degradation or, less commonly, cell failures, though these are often covered by Tesla's extensive battery warranty. Other reported issues include problems with the air suspension system (leaks, compressor failure), the 12V auxiliary battery, and occasional glitches with the infotainment screen or door handle mechanisms. Exterior and interior components are largely reported as reliable. Owners should be aware of the battery warranty terms and potential costs associated with out-of-warranty repairs for battery or suspension components.
