The 2018 Tesla Model S is a fully electric luxury sedan known for its impressive performance, long range, and cutting-edge technology. The 2018 Model S came in several configurations, including the 75D, 100D, and P100D. The 75D offered a range of around 259 miles and acceleration from 0-60 mph in about 4.2 seconds. The 100D extended the range to approximately 335 miles, while the high-performance P100D variant delivered blistering acceleration, reaching 60 mph in as little as 2.5 seconds. Horsepower figures varied depending on the specific configuration, with the P100D boasting over 700 horsepower. Owners generally appreciate the Model S for its smooth ride, advanced autopilot features, and environmentally friendly operation. However, some common complaints include build quality issues, expensive repairs, and reliance on Tesla's proprietary service network.

**Electric Motor**

**All Models**
* **Drive Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A common issue involves premature failure of the drive unit, resulting in reduced power, unusual noises (whining or grinding), or complete loss of propulsion. Some owners have reported multiple drive unit replacements within the warranty period.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected drive unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **HV Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gradual loss of battery capacity over time, leading to reduced range. The rate of degradation can vary depending on charging habits, climate, and driving style.
    * Solution: Battery replacement or, in some cases, Tesla may offer a software update to recalibrate the battery management system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $12,000 - $20,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**All Models**

* **MCU (Media Control Unit) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The MCU controls the central display screen, navigation, climate control, and other vehicle functions. Failures can manifest as a blank screen, slow response times, or complete system crashes. Older Tegra-based MCUs (specifically on earlier Model S vehicles than 2018) are prone to this issue.
    * Solution: Replacement of the MCU. Tesla began offering an MCU upgrade that replaces the Tegra-based unit with a more modern Intel Atom-based unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000
    * Recalls: Recall number: SB-21-11-008
 (For Model S vehicles produced from approximately 2012 to early 2018. It addresses potential failures in the eMMC NAND flash memory chip within the MCU.)

* **12V Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery powers auxiliary systems like lights, door locks, and the car's computer when it's not actively driving. Premature failure is a common complaint, resulting in warning messages, difficulty starting, or complete system shutdown.
    * Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $350
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Phantom Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain while the vehicle is parked and not in use. This can be caused by various factors, including software glitches, always-on features, or faulty components.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the root cause of the drain, which may involve software updates, disabling certain features, or replacing faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the cause; can range from a software fix to several thousand dollars for component replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**All Models with Air Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor is responsible for maintaining the correct ride height. Failure can lead to sagging suspension, error messages, and a harsh ride.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Air Suspension Strut Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air leaks in the suspension struts can cause the car to sit unevenly, especially overnight. This often starts as a slow leak and gradually worsens.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking air suspension strut(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+ per strut
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**All Models**

* **Door Handle Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The retractable door handles can fail to extend or retract properly, especially in cold weather. This can be caused by a faulty motor, broken gears, or frozen components.
    * Solution: Replacement of the door handle assembly or individual components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per handle
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

**All Models**

* **Sunroof Rattles**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling or creaking noises emanating from the sunroof area while driving. This can be caused by loose components or improper lubrication.
    * Solution: Tightening loose components, lubricating moving parts, or replacing worn seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Seat Heater Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters failing to warm up or malfunctioning intermittently.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty heating element or control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Tesla Model S, while offering impressive performance and technology, is prone to certain issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the MCU and 12V battery, are relatively common. Suspension issues with air suspension-equipped models can also be costly to repair. While drive unit and battery replacements are less frequent, they represent significant expenses if they occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs that can significantly impact the vehicle's usability. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in the potential costs of repairs when considering a used 2018 Model S.
