The 2019 Tesla Model S is a fully electric luxury sedan known for its impressive performance, long range, and cutting-edge technology. Available powertrain options include various configurations of dual motor all-wheel drive, with performance figures ranging significantly depending on the specific variant. For example, the Long Range variant produces approximately 402 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque, while the Performance variant significantly increases those numbers. Owners often praise the Model S for its rapid acceleration, advanced Autopilot system, and spacious interior. However, some common criticisms include concerns about build quality, reliability issues with certain components, and high repair costs.
