The 2015 Tesla Model S is an all-electric luxury sedan known for its impressive range, performance, and innovative technology. In 2015, the Model S was available with several battery pack options, including 60 kWh, 70 kWh, 85 kWh, and later, a 90 kWh pack. The performance varied depending on the battery and motor configuration, with the P85D model boasting dual motors and all-wheel drive, producing over 690 horsepower and achieving a 0-60 mph time of around 3.1 seconds. Owners often praise the Model S for its smooth and quiet ride, instant torque, advanced autopilot features, and over-the-air software updates. However, common complaints revolve around build quality issues, expensive repairs (especially battery-related), and long waiting times for service appointments.
