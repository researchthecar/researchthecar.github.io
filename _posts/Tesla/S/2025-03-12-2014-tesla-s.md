The 2014 Tesla Model S was a groundbreaking all-electric sedan that offered impressive range, performance, and technology for its time. The 2014 Model S was only available with an electric motor and single-speed transmission. Horsepower ranged from 382 hp to 416 hp depending on the model and battery size. Torque ranged from 325 lb-ft to 443 lb-ft. Owners often praised its quick acceleration, spacious interior, and advanced features, while some common complaints included build quality issues, range anxiety (especially with older batteries), and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Electric Motor**

**85 kWh Electric Motor**
*   **Premature Drive Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises, loss of power, or complete failure of the electric motor. Early drive units (especially Gen 1) were prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the drive unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Reduced Battery Capacity Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in maximum range due to battery degradation. This is normal for all electric vehicles, but can be more noticeable on older Model S vehicles.
    *   Solution: Battery replacement (if degradation is excessive).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $12,000 - $20,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Single-Speed Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, error messages, inability to adjust ride height, compressor failure, and leaks in the air lines or struts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected air suspension components (struts, compressor, air lines).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ per strut; $800-$1500+ for compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent dead 12V battery, causing vehicle malfunction or inability to start (power up).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery. Upgrading to a Lithium 12v battery has proven to be more reliable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Touchscreen Delamination/Failure (MCU1)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Yellowing around the edges of the touchscreen, slow response times, eventual complete failure of the screen which controls many vehicle functions. This is especially common on vehicles with the older MCU1 (Media Control Unit 1).
    *   Solution: Replacement or upgrade of the MCU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+ (for MCU2 upgrade)
    *   Recalls: Certain vehicles were subject to recall for MCU failure.
