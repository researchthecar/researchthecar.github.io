*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points in the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and around the turbochargers. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals. Thorough inspection to pinpoint the exact source of the leak is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the location and complexity.

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating can occur due to coolant leaks, radiator problems, or thermostat failure. Symptoms include the temperature gauge rising into the red zone, steam coming from under the hood, and a sweet smell of coolant.
    *   Solution: Repairing coolant leaks, replacing the radiator, thermostat, or water pump as needed. Pressure testing the system to identify leaks is important.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the affected parts.

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can resolve the issue. Other times, it may require transmission service or valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $3,000+ (valve body replacement).

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip out of gear or hesitate when accelerating. This can be accompanied by unusual noises.
    *   Solution: A full transmission rebuild or replacement may be required in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (rebuild/replacement).

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system is complex and prone to leaks, causing the car to sag on one or more corners. The air compressor may run excessively to compensate.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the air leak. The leak could be a faulty air strut, air line, or compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ per strut. Air compressor replacement can be $1,000-$2,000.

*   **Ride Height Sensor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Incorrect ride height, warning lights on the dashboard, or an uneven stance of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ride height sensor and recalibrating the suspension system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or failure to respond to inputs. Navigation problems, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and screen malfunctions are also reported.

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery may drain quickly, especially if left unused for extended periods. This can result in difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Testing the charging system and battery. Identifying and resolving parasitic draws that are draining the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (battery replacement) - $1,000+ (diagnose and repair parasitic draw).

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors may fail to detect objects, resulting in false alarms or no alerts at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per sensor.

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2018 Rolls-Royce Ghost, while a symbol of luxury and refinement, can be susceptible to certain issues. The most common problems revolve around the engine (oil leaks and cooling system issues), transmission (harsh shifting), air suspension (leaks), and electrical systems (infotainment glitches). While some issues may be minor and easily resolved with a software update, others, such as transmission rebuilds or air suspension repairs, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a qualified Rolls-Royce technician before purchase to identify any existing or potential problems.
