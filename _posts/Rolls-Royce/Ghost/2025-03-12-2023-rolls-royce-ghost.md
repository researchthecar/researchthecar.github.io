The 2023 Rolls-Royce Ghost is a pinnacle of luxury and refinement, powered by a potent 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 563 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A Black Badge version of the Ghost exists, boosting the engine to 592 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the Ghost's opulent interior, smooth ride, and effortless performance. However, some criticisms include its high price, large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and the potential for expensive maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**6.75L Twin-Turbocharged V12**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and a noticeable decrease in power. This can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking for fault codes and testing individual components. Replacing the faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors resolves the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Experiencing harsh or delayed shifts between gears. The transmission may also hesitate when accelerating from a stop. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Checking and topping off the transmission fluid can sometimes resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, a valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $6,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may sit unevenly, with one corner lower than the others. The ride quality may also become harsh and bumpy. This is typically caused by leaks in the air struts, a faulty air compressor, or a malfunctioning control module.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air struts, air compressor, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently. This can be caused by software glitches, corrupted data, or hardware issues.
    *   Solution: Restarting the system may temporarily resolve the issue. Software updates may provide a more permanent fix. In severe cases, the infotainment system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $5,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when parked for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from an electrical component that remains active even when the car is off.
    *   Solution: Identifying and resolving the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve disconnecting and testing individual components to isolate the faulty circuit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Door Closing Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic door closing feature may fail to operate properly. The doors may not close completely, or they may close with excessive force. This can be caused by faulty sensors, actuators, or control modules.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensors, actuators, or control modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to function properly. Some examples may be when a window only rolls up part way, rolls up very slowly, or does not roll up at all. This can be caused by a bad window motor or damage to a regulator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves removing the door panel and testing the window switch and motor. Replacing the faulty components resolves the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Rolls-Royce Ghost, while offering unparalleled luxury and performance, may be prone to certain issues, primarily related to its complex systems like the air suspension and infotainment, as well as potential engine misfires. While some issues can be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes, others may require costly repairs or replacements. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their ownership considerations, including extended warranty options.
