The 2019 Rolls-Royce Ghost is a luxury sedan known for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and powerful performance. All 2019 Ghost models are equipped with a 6.6-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 563 horsepower and 605 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the car's unparalleled luxury, quiet cabin, and effortless acceleration. Conversely, some find the infotainment system dated, the rear seat legroom less generous than expected for its size, and the running costs extremely high.
