*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various seals and gaskets, particularly around the valve covers and oil pan. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected seals and gaskets is the typical solution. Thorough cleaning of the engine bay is recommended after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the location and extent of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can stem from worn hoses, radiator leaks, or issues with the water pump. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking components, such as hoses, the radiator, or water pump, is required. Pressure testing the cooling system can help pinpoint the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the source and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed driving or when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: A software update or recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush or replacement of faulty solenoids may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the cause and the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
