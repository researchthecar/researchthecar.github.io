The 2020 Rolls-Royce Ghost is a luxury sedan known for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and powerful performance. It is offered with a single engine option: a 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 563 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Ghost for its unparalleled comfort, quiet cabin, and distinctive styling. However, some common dislikes include the high price tag, running costs, and relatively subdued driving dynamics compared to sportier luxury sedans.
