It is powered by a 6.75-liter V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. While the Silver Spur is celebrated for its exceptional comfort and prestige, it has faced some specific issues over the years.

**Engine**

* **Solenoid failure:** The transmission solenoids can fail, causing shifting problems and erratic gear changes. Symptoms include delayed or no shifting, slipping gears, and check engine lights. Requires replacing the faulty solenoid. **$300 - $1,000+**
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, leading to a loss of power and transmission overheating. Symptoms include a lack of acceleration, shuddering, and transmission slipping. Requires replacing the torque converter. **$2,000 - $5,000+**

* **Climate control system failure:** The climate control system can experience issues, such as the fan malfunctioning, the controls not working properly, or the A/C not cooling. Requires diagnosing and repairing the affected component. **$300 - $2,000+**

**Summary:**

The 1997 Rolls-Royce Silver Spur is a sophisticated vehicle with a limited but notable range of potential issues. While some problems, such as electrical harness issues or wood trim peeling, are relatively minor, more serious issues like intake manifold gasket failure or transmission failure can be costly to repair. It is important for owners and potential buyers to be aware of these potential issues and to have them addressed proactively to maintain the vehicle's performance and value.
