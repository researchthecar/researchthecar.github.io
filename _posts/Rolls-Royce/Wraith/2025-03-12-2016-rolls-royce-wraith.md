The 2016 Rolls-Royce Wraith is a luxury grand tourer coupe known for its opulent interior, powerful engine, and iconic styling. It is equipped with a 6.6-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 624 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Wraith for its smooth ride, effortless acceleration, and handcrafted interior. Criticisms often focus on its substantial size and weight, which can make it feel less agile than smaller coupes, as well as its high price tag and potentially costly maintenance.
