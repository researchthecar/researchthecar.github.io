The 2002 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph represents the pinnacle of luxury and hand-crafted automotive engineering. It was offered with a single engine and transmission option: a 5.4-liter V12 engine producing 322 horsepower and 361 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Seraph's opulent interior, smooth ride, and iconic styling. However, the complex systems and reliance on specialized parts can lead to significant maintenance costs. Some common dislikes include the car's large size, fuel consumption, and the potential for expensive repairs, particularly with age.

**Summary**

The 2002 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph offers unparalleled luxury, but its complex systems and age can lead to a variety of issues. Engine oil leaks and cooling system problems, along with transmission slipping, are common concerns that can be expensive to address. The air suspension system is another significant area of potential expense. While some repairs may be relatively minor, others can require extensive work and specialized parts, resulting in high repair costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Rolls-Royce mechanic is highly recommended.
