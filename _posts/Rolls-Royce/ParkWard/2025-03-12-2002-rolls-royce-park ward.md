The 2002 Rolls-Royce Park Ward, a long-wheelbase version of the Silver Seraph, represents the pinnacle of luxury and craftsmanship. Powered by a naturally aspirated 5.4-liter V12 engine producing approximately 322 horsepower and 361 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, it offers a smooth and refined driving experience. Owners often praise the opulent interior, the comfortable ride, and the prestige associated with the Rolls-Royce brand. However, like any complex machine, the Park Ward is not without its potential issues, and the cost of repair can be significant. Dislikes often center around the high maintenance costs, potential electrical gremlins, and the car's sheer size, making it less practical for everyday use.
