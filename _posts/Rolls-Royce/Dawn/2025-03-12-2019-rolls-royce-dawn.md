The 2019 Rolls-Royce Dawn is a luxury convertible known for its opulent features, smooth ride, and powerful performance. Itâ€™s powered by a 6.6-liter twin-turbo V12 engine that produces 563 horsepower and 605 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Dawn for its exquisite craftsmanship, comfortable interior, and effortless performance. Criticisms typically center around the vehicle's high price tag, limited rear seat space, and considerable size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces.
