The 2006 Rolls-Royce Phantom is a statement of luxury and opulence, powered by a naturally aspirated 6.75-liter V12 engine producing 453 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Phantom for its smooth ride, opulent interior, and imposing presence. Criticisms often revolve around its high running costs, complex electronics, and susceptibility to component failures due to its age and intricate systems.
