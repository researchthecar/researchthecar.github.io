The 2021 Rolls-Royce Phantom is the pinnacle of luxury, powered by a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V12 engine producing 563 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque. The engine is coupled to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Phantom for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and near-silent operation.
