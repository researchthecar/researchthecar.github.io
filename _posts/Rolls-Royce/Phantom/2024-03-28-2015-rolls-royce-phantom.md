**Introduction**

The 2015 Rolls-Royce Phantom is a pinnacle of luxury and performance. It is powered by a monstrous 6.7-liter V12 engine that produces 453 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque. The Phantom is a formidable sedan that steers smooth and effortless, providing the utmost comfort and prestige. It offers a serene cabin with exquisite materials, advanced technology, and an unrivaled rear-seat experience.

**Engine**
**6.7L V12**
* **Fuel Leak:** This problem has been linked to a faulty fuel line. Symptoms include a strong gasoline odor, poor fuel efficiency, and difficulty starting the engine. The recommended solution is to replace the fuel line, which costs approximately $800 - $1000, and includes the cost of labor.
**Recalls:** None Found

**Transmission**
**8-Speed Automatic**
* **Transmission Slipping:** A common problem is a slipping transmission, where the gears fail to engage correctly. It can be caused by worn-out clutches or a faulty transmission control module (TCM). Repair typically includes replacing the defective component, which can range from $800 to over $5000 depending on the parts used.
* **Transmission Shudder:** Occasionally, drivers may encounter a shudder or vibration while shifting gears. This issue is commonly traced to faulty transmission mounts or worn-out fluid. Resolving the problem may involve replacing the mounts or performing a transmission fluid change, which can cost around $150-$300.

**Suspension**
* **Air Suspension Failure:** Owners have experienced sudden failures of the air suspension system, resulting in the loss of ride height. The root cause is often faulty air struts or a malfunctioning air compressor. Repairing the issue typically requires replacing the air suspension components, which can cost between $2000 to $4000 for parts and labor.
* **Front End Noise:** Some owners have reported unusual noises coming from the front end, particularly over rough roads. In some cases, the noise was traced to loose or worn suspension components. Resolving the issue may involve tightening or replacing the affected parts at a cost of around $200-$500 for labor and parts.

**Electrical**
* **Battery Drain:** Occasionally, owners have encountered a battery drain that can lead to a dead battery. The cause can be a parasitic draw from faulty electrical components. Diagnosis and repair typically involve testing the electrical system for any faulty components and replacing them as needed. The cost can vary depending on the specific cause.
* **Navigation Screen Malfunction:** A few owners have reported issues with the navigation screen becoming unresponsive or displaying incorrect information. The solution typically involves updating the software or replacing the screen, which can range from $500-$1000.

**Exterior**
* **Chrome Trim Discoloration:** Exposure to harsh weather conditions can sometimes cause the chrome trim to discolor or develop a dull appearance. A solution is to have the chrome pieces professionally polished or replaced, which can cost around $100-$500 depending on the severity of the problem.
* **Door Handle Sticking:** Some owners have encountered problems with the exterior door handles sticking or becoming difficult to operate. This can be caused by a faulty door handle mechanism or worn-out parts. The solution is typically to replace the defective components, which can cost around $200-$400 for parts and labor.

**Interior**
* **Panoramic Roof Shade Malfunction:** There have been instances of the panoramic roof shade getting stuck or opening/closing erratically. The issue can be traced to a faulty motor or a problem with the control mechanism. Repairing the issue may involve replacing the motor or a component within the shade system at a cost of around $500-$1000.
* **Infotainment System Lag:** A few owners have reported occasional lag or freezing when using the infotainment system. A software update or a restart of the system typically resolves the issue. If the problem persists, it may require a more extensive repair or a replacement of the infotainment unit, which can range from $500 to over $2000.

**Summary**

The 2015 Rolls-Royce Phantom is a highly sophisticated and opulent vehicle, but it is not immune to occasional issues. Some of the commonly reported problems include fuel leaks from a faulty fuel line, transmission slipping due to worn-out clutches or a faulty TCM, suspension failures caused by defective air struts or a malfunctioning air compressor, battery drain due to parasitic electrical draws, chrome trim discoloration from exposure to harsh elements, and minor interior issues such as a sticking panoramic roof shade or infotainment system lag. While the cost of repairs can be substantial, they are not overly frequent considering the vehicle's high level of engineering and luxury.
