**Summary**
The 2007 Rolls-Royce Phantom, while a symbol of luxury, can present owners with a range of issues, primarily revolving around its complex air suspension, electrical systems, and engine. Engine and transmission issues are prevalent, especially regarding oil leaks and rough shifting. The air suspension is prone to failure, leading to costly repairs. Electrical glitches, particularly within the infotainment system, are also common. While some issues may be minor, many repairs can be quite expensive due to the car's sophisticated engineering and the cost of genuine Rolls-Royce parts. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and ensure a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
