**2014 Rolls-Royce Phantom**

The 2014 Rolls-Royce Phantom is a luxury sedan that offers an unparalleled level of comfort, craftsmanship, and prestige. It is powered by a 6.75-liter V12 engine that produces 453 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

Despite its opulent nature, the Phantom has not been immune to issues. Here's a detailed breakdown of the specific problems reported by owners:

**Engine**

**6.75-liter V12**

* **Valve Stem Seal Failure:** Oil leaks around the valve stem seals, causing smoke from the exhaust and reduced oil pressure. Requires replacement of the valve stem seals. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Intake Manifold Vacuum Leak:** A leak in the intake manifold causes rough idling, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. Requires replacement of the intake manifold gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Coolant Thermostat Failure:** A faulty thermostat prevents the engine from reaching optimal operating temperature, leading to poor fuel economy and reduced performance. Requires replacement of the thermostat. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Delays:** Occasional delays in shifting gears, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. Requires software updates or transmission fluid replacement. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+
* **Torque Converter Shudder:** Vibrations felt through the driveline when the transmission is engaged. Requires replacement of the torque converter. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $4,000+
* **Transmission Fluid Leak:** Leaks from the transmission's seals or gaskets, causing low fluid levels and potential transmission damage. Requires resealing or gasket replacement. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+
