### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Rolls-Royce Corniche is a testament to enduring luxury and engineering. While its core powertrain components (engine and transmission) are remarkably robust with no widespread reported issues, owners should be aware of potential vulnerabilities in the sophisticated hydraulic suspension system, particularly regarding fluid leaks and accumulator wear. Electrical systems, while generally reliable, can be susceptible to corrosion over time, leading to intermittent faults. The exquisite interior and exterior finishes, while beautiful, require diligent care to prevent degradation of leather, wood, and chrome. Proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly are key to preserving the Corniche's legendary status and ensuring a pleasurable ownership experience.
