*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, timing chain covers, and oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals. In some cases, sealant may need to be reapplied.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.

    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Retractable Hardtop Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The retractable hardtop mechanism can be prone to malfunctions. Symptoms range from the top not opening or closing completely, to getting stuck mid-cycle, to warning lights appearing on the dashboard. This is often related to the hydraulic system or the various sensors and actuators that control the top.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific problem (faulty sensor, hydraulic pump, etc.) and replacement or repair of the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.

    *   Solution: Refinishing or replacing the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per component, depending on the part and refinishing method.
