### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Ferrari California, while a desirable exotic, presents a mixed reliability profile. The powertrain, particularly the engine and dual-clutch transmission, can be sources of significant expense, with issues like dry sump leaks, timing chain wear, mechatronic unit failures, and clutch pack wear being documented. The sophisticated retractable hardtop mechanism also requires attention, with potential for actuator or motor issues. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are not uncommon. Owners should budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the complex mechanical and electrical systems. Regular specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these risks.
