### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ferrari California is a desirable grand tourer with a generally robust mechanical foundation. However, potential buyers should be aware of specific issues that can arise, particularly concerning the dual-clutch transmission's mechatronic unit and clutch packs, as well as potential leaks in the dry sump lubrication system. The retractable hardtop mechanism can also be a source of costly repairs if actuators or motors fail. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, and issues with the optional Magnetorheological dampers are also noted. While not indicative of widespread failure across all vehicles, these are the most commonly cited technical concerns that may require attention and budget for repair.
