The 2015 Ferrari 458 Italia is a mid-engine sports car powered by a naturally aspirated 4.5-liter V8 engine, producing 562 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. It was available exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Praised for its exceptional performance, thrilling engine note, and stunning design, the 458 Italia is a highly desirable sports car. However, like all vehicles, it has its share of issues. Some owners dislike the relatively firm ride and limited storage space, while others have reported experiencing specific component failures, albeit less frequent than some mass-produced vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.5L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations on the engine, including the valve covers, timing chain cover, and oil pan. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals is the most common solution. In some cases, resealing the entire engine may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the exhaust manifolds, especially near the welds, can occur due to thermal stress. Symptoms include a ticking noise that gets louder with engine RPM, a decrease in performance, and potentially exhaust fumes entering the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cracked exhaust manifold. Upgraded aftermarket manifolds are available that are more resistant to cracking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear can occur, especially with aggressive driving or frequent track use. Symptoms include slipping during gear changes, jerky acceleration, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit (TCU) controls the hydraulic actuation of the transmission. Failure can lead to erratic shifting, inability to select gears, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper (Shock Absorber) Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive dampers can develop leaks or fail, leading to reduced ride quality and handling performance. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, unusual noises from the suspension, and error messages related to the suspension system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (depending on how many dampers need replacing and if OEM or aftermarket parts are used)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur, especially when the car is not driven frequently. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car, a dead battery, and error messages related to the electrical system.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly check all electrical components to identify the source of the parasitic drain. A common culprit can be the alarm system or a faulty control module. The battery may also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car, such as those related to the engine, transmission, and braking system, can fail. Symptoms vary depending on the sensor, but can include error messages, reduced performance, and drivability issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation can build up inside the headlight housings, especially in humid conditions. This can reduce visibility and potentially damage the headlight components.
    *   Solution: Sealing the headlight housing or replacing the affected headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Buttons/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft-touch coatings used on some interior buttons and trim pieces can become sticky and degrade over time, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Refinishing or replacing the affected buttons and trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
