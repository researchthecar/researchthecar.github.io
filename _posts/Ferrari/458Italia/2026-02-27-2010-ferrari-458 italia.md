### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia is a highly capable supercar with a generally strong reliability record for its performance segment. However, potential owners should be aware of specific issues such as leaks in the dry sump lubrication system, exhaust manifold cracking, and potential malfunctions with the dual-clutch transmission's clutch actuators or software. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, can also occur. Suspension components, like the magnetorheological dampers, can be costly to repair if they fail. While not as prone to widespread failures as some mass-produced vehicles, the cost of repairs for these specialized components can be significant, emphasizing the importance of thorough pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance by qualified technicians.
