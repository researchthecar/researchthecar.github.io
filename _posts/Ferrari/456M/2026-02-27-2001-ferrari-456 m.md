### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ferrari 456 M is a remarkable car, but like most exotics of its vintage, it demands diligent maintenance and a significant budget for upkeep. The V12 engine, while powerful, has potential for costly issues like timing belt failure if maintenance intervals are ignored. The F1 transmission, in particular, can be a source of expensive repairs due to its complex hydraulic system. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module, are not uncommon. Owners should prioritize sourcing a well-maintained example with a comprehensive service history and be prepared for the associated costs of ownership, which are considerably higher than for mainstream luxury vehicles. Despite these potential challenges, with proper care, the 456 M offers an unparalleled driving experience.
