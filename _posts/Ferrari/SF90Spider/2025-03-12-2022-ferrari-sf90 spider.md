The 2022 Ferrari SF90 Spider is a high-performance plug-in hybrid convertible, boasting a blistering 986 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque from its hybrid powertrain. The SF90 Spider only came with one engine option, a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that is paired with three electric motors. The car is known for its incredible acceleration, advanced technology, and stunning design. However, some owners have reported issues with the car's complex systems and overall reliability. Some drivers like the unique styling and performance, while others find the car's ride quality harsh and its technology somewhat overwhelming.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**

*   **Hybrid System Faults**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Several owners have reported intermittent "Hybrid System Fault" warnings appearing on the dashboard. This can be accompanied by a temporary loss of power or limited electric driving range. Some owners have reported it occurring during charging, acceleration, and other various scenarios.
    *   Solution: The faults usually require diagnostics at a certified Ferrari dealership to diagnose the problem, which can range from a faulty sensor to a more significant issue within the hybrid system's battery or control unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis at a dealership typically costs $300-$500, with repair costs varying widely depending on the issue (potential repair costs ranging from $500 to upwards of $10,000 if a significant hybrid component needs replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Transmission Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation or jerking during gear changes, particularly at lower speeds or when shifting between automatic and manual modes. Some have reported a clunking noise during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Software updates or recalibration of the transmission control unit (TCU) have resolved the issue in some cases. More severe cases may require clutch adjustments or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates can range from $200-$500. Clutch adjustments or replacement can cost $5,000 - $10,000 or more, depending on the extent of the damage and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ride Quality Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SF90 Spider's suspension, while designed for performance, can be stiff and uncomfortable on rough road surfaces. Some owners have complained about excessive road noise transmitted into the cabin.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the suspension settings (if equipped with adjustable dampers) can help improve ride comfort. However, the inherent stiffness of the suspension system cannot be completely eliminated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A - This is often a characteristic of the vehicle rather than a specific component failure. If dampers are faulty, replacement costs can range from $2,000-$5,000 per corner.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the infotainment system, including screen freezes, slow response times, and Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the most common solution. In some cases, a complete system reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. Infotainment unit replacement can cost $2,000 - $5,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, including those related to parking assist, tire pressure monitoring, and driver-assistance systems, have been reported to malfunction occasionally.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis at a dealership to determine the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Sensor replacement can cost $300 - $1,000+ per sensor, depending on the type and location.
