The 2015 Ferrari California T marked a significant shift for the model, introducing a turbocharged engine to the lineup. This model is powered by a 3.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, producing 553 horsepower and 557 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option is a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners typically praise the California T for its improved performance and modern infotainment system compared to its predecessor, as well as its comfortable grand touring capabilities with a retractable hardtop. However, some find its styling less traditionally Ferrari and its exhaust note less exhilarating than naturally aspirated Ferrari engines.
