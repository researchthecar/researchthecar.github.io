The 2016 Ferrari California T is a grand touring sports car that combines open-top driving with Ferrari performance and luxury. It's powered by a 3.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, producing 553 horsepower and 557 lb-ft of torque. The California T is equipped exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally praise the car for its beautiful design, comfortable ride, and exhilarating performance. Some common criticisms include the exhaust note not being as evocative as naturally aspirated Ferraris and occasional complaints about infotainment system usability. Here's a breakdown of the common issues and complaints:

**Summary**

The 2016 Ferrari California T, while a beautiful and high-performing vehicle, can be prone to certain issues. The most significant concerns are related to the engine (turbocharger and oil leaks), transmission (clutch wear and TCM failure), and suspension (Magneride damper failure). Electrical and retractable hardtop issues are also common. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, making it essential to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified Ferrari technician. While expensive repairs are possible, regular maintenance and careful driving habits can mitigate the risk of some of these problems.
