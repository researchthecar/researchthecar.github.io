Transmission problems, especially clutch wear and mechatronic unit issues, are also potential concerns. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system and convertible top, can be frustrating. Interior issues like sticky trim and leather shrinkage detract from the overall luxury experience. The severity of these issues varies, but repairs can often be expensive due to the specialized nature of Ferrari parts and labor. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
