The 2018 Ferrari GTC4Lusso is a grand tourer offering both performance and practicality. It comes with two engine options: a 6.3L naturally aspirated V12 producing 681 hp and 514 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.9L twin-turbo V8 producing 602 hp and 561 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the car's comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and impressive performance. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, occasional electronic glitches, and limited rear passenger space, especially with taller occupants.

**Engine**

**6.3L Naturally Aspirated V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often from valve cover gaskets or the oil pan gasket. This can lead to reduced oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed promptly. Owners may notice oil spots on the garage floor or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets and seals. Thorough cleaning of the affected area is recommended after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine performance. Can trigger the check engine light. Often caused by clogged or malfunctioning fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the faulty injector(s), followed by replacement. Cleaning the fuel system may also be recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.9L Twin-Turbo V8**

*   **Turbocharger Wastegate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost, reduced engine power, and potential turbocharger failure. Can manifest as a whistling sound from the turbochargers.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of the wastegate actuator or the entire turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, often from the coolant hoses or the water pump. This can lead to overheating and potential engine damage if not addressed promptly. Owners may notice a sweet smell coming from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking hoses and/or water pump. Thorough cleaning of the affected area is recommended after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during gear changes, rough shifting, and potential clutch failure. Especially prevalent with aggressive driving or frequent track use.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch assembly. May also require replacement of the dual-mass flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, inability to select gears, or complete transmission failure. The mechatronic unit is the electronic control module for the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reprogramming of the mechatronic unit. Sometimes, the entire transmission needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking noises from the suspension, degraded ride quality, and reduced handling performance. These cars have electronic dampers that are prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty dampers. Often recommended to replace dampers in pairs (front or rear) to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent battery drain, especially if the car is not driven regularly. Can be caused by parasitic draw from various electronic modules.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the source of the parasitic draw, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty component. Battery tender recommended for long periods of non-use.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, and unresponsive touchscreen. Software updates may resolve some issues, but hardware failures can occur.

**Summary**

The 2018 Ferrari GTC4Lusso, while a stunning and high-performing grand tourer, can suffer from several issues ranging in severity and cost. Engine oil leaks and fuel injector problems plague the V12 engine, while turbocharger and cooling issues affect the V8. Transmission problems like clutch wear and mechatronic unit failure are prevalent across both engine options. Suspension damper failures, electrical glitches (especially battery drain and infotainment issues), headlight condensation, and dashboard leather shrinkage are also common concerns. The cost of repairs can be significant, making it essential to have a thorough pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified Ferrari technician. Regular maintenance and proactive care are crucial to mitigate these potential problems.
