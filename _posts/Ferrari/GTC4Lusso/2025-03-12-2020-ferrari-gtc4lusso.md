The 2020 Ferrari GTC4Lusso is a grand tourer known for its exceptional performance and luxurious appointments. Offered with two distinct engine options, the 6.3L naturally aspirated V12 producing 680 horsepower and 514 lb-ft of torque and a 3.9L twin-turbocharged V8 delivering 602 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of torque, both engines are paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners frequently praise the GTC4Lusso for its exhilarating acceleration, comfortable ride, and unique shooting-brake design. Criticisms often center around the high cost of ownership, complex electronics, and somewhat limited rear passenger space for taller occupants.

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points on the engine, most commonly from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or around the timing chain cover. This can result in a burning oil smell, visible oil drips, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty gaskets or seals is typically the fix. The engine may need to be partially disassembled to access the leaking components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased power, and the check engine light illuminating.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the specific cylinder(s) misfiring is key. Replacing the faulty coil(s), spark plug(s), or injector(s) usually resolves the issue.
