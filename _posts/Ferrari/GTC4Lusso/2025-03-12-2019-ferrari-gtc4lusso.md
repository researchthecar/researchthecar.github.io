The 2019 Ferrari GTC4Lusso is a grand tourer known for its distinctive shooting-brake design, all-wheel drive, and powerful engines. It comes in two main configurations: the GTC4Lusso, powered by a naturally aspirated 6.3-liter V12 engine producing 681 horsepower and 514 lb-ft of torque, and the GTC4Lusso T, featuring a turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 engine with 602 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.
