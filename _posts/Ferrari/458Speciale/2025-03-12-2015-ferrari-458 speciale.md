The 2015 Ferrari 458 Speciale is a high-performance variant of the already impressive 458 Italia. It boasts a naturally aspirated 4.5-liter V8 engine, producing a staggering 597 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. This engine is exclusively paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The Speciale is celebrated for its razor-sharp handling, exhilarating performance, and the visceral experience provided by its high-revving engine. Common praises include its incredible sound, precise steering, and track-focused capabilities. Criticisms, although rare, often revolve around its firm ride, limited practicality due to its track-oriented nature, and the high cost of ownership and maintenance.

**Engine**

**4.5L Naturally Aspirated V8**

*   **Engine Knocking/Detonation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine knocking or detonation, particularly under high load or during track use. This could be caused by a number of factors, including fuel quality, carbon buildup, or issues with the engine management system.
    *   Solution: Addressing this issue typically involves a thorough engine inspection, potentially including cleaning carbon deposits, checking fuel injectors, and verifying the proper function of the engine management system. In severe cases, internal engine components might need to be inspected.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Performing a leak down test can provide insight to whether the high oil consumption is due to worn piston rings or a valve issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch**

*   **Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission exhibiting hesitation or rough shifting, especially during low-speed maneuvers or when cold. This can manifest as jerky engagement or delays in gear changes.
    *   Solution: The most common solution involves software updates or recalibration of the transmission control unit (TCU). In some cases, replacement of clutch packs or solenoids within the transmission may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*No Issues Found*

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported instances of various sensor failures, including those related to the TPMS, ABS, and engine management system. These failures can trigger warning lights on the dashboard and potentially affect vehicle performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor and replacing it with a new unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue with many Ferrari models from this era, including the 458 Speciale, is "sticky" interior components. This is caused by the degradation of a rubberized coating used on certain plastic parts, such as dashboard trim, center console buttons, and door handles. The affected surfaces become sticky and unpleasant to the touch.
    *   Solution: The sticky coating can be professionally removed and the parts refinished, or the affected components can be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Ferrari 458 Speciale, while an exceptional performance machine, can experience certain issues. Engine knocking, high oil consumption, rough transmission shifting, sensor failures, and the common sticky interior are potential areas of concern. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to address, others, especially those related to the engine or transmission, can be costly to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and conduct thorough inspections and maintenance checks before purchasing.
