The 2017 Ferrari F12tdf is a limited-edition, track-focused version of the F12berlinetta. It boasts a naturally aspirated 6.3-liter V12 engine producing 769 horsepower and 520 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners praise the F12tdf for its exhilarating performance, exceptional handling, and stunning design. Common dislikes include the firm ride (due to its track-oriented setup), high running costs, and limited practicality. No other engines or transmissions were available on this specific model.

**Engine**

**6.3L V12**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-expected oil consumption, especially during track use or spirited driving. This can manifest as the need to add oil between scheduled services or seeing a low oil warning light on the dash.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels is recommended. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection to check for leaks or internal engine wear is necessary. A rebuild may be required in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly, from a few hundred for minor repairs to $10,000+ for a rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the exhaust manifolds can occur due to high temperatures and thermal stress, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking or hissing noise from the engine bay, reduced performance, and a smell of exhaust fumes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifolds. Upgraded, more durable aftermarket manifolds are also available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dual-clutch transmission can experience premature clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping during gear changes, jerky engagement, and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is necessary. Some owners opt for upgraded clutch packs for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gear Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent errors and difficulty selecting gears, potentially accompanied by warning messages on the dashboard indicating a transmission fault.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty gear position sensor within the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetorheological Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F12tdf utilizes magnetorheological dampers for adjustable ride control. Failures can manifest as a loss of damping control, leading to a harsher or bouncier ride. Warning lights may appear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ per damper.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, especially when the car is not driven regularly. This can lead to a dead battery and the inability to start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly check the charging system for any parasitic drains, or replace the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Carbon Fiber Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delamination, or separation, of the layers of the carbon fiber components (splitters, diffusers, etc.) can occur due to UV exposure or impact damage.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the affected carbon fiber part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $10,000+ depending on the part and severity of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Buttons/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ferrari's of this era are known for having a "sticky button" issue. The soft-touch coating applied to certain interior buttons and trim pieces can degrade over time, becoming sticky or tacky to the touch.
    *   Solution: Professional cleaning and reapplication of the coating, or replacement of the affected parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the issue and whether parts are replaced or refurbished.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Ferrari F12tdf, while an exceptional performance car, is not without its potential issues. Engine-related concerns, such as oil consumption and exhaust manifold cracks, can be costly to address. The dual-clutch transmission may require clutch replacement over time. Electrical issues are less frequent but should be checked. The suspension components can also be costly to fix. Sticky interior components are a common annoyance. Overall, the F12tdf can be relatively reliable if well-maintained, but potential owners should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair costs due to the car's high-performance nature and exotic components.
