### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Ferrari Portofino, while a marvel of engineering, presents a few specific areas that may require attention beyond routine maintenance. The engine's twin-turbo V8, though powerful, has seen reports of wastegate actuator failures and oil cooler leaks. The dual-clutch transmission can experience issues with its mechatronic unit, leading to shifting problems. The sophisticated magnetorheological suspension, while enhancing ride quality, is susceptible to damper seal failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system's software and potential parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Exteriorly, LED headlight moisture intrusion can occur. Internally, the HVAC blower motor is a component that has shown some susceptibility to failure. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly for specialized repairs, which are typical for a vehicle of this caliber.
