The 2017 Ferrari LaFerrari is a limited-production hybrid sports car, featuring a mid-mounted 6.3-liter V12 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 949 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque. It exclusively uses a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners rave about its breathtaking performance, stunning design, and exclusivity. Some common criticisms include the high cost of maintenance, limited practicality, and occasional electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**6.3L V12 Hybrid**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, reduced engine performance, and potential emissions test failure. This is generally caused by degradation or damage to the catalytic converters.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, and low oil level. This issue is sometimes observed around the oil pan gasket, valve cover gaskets, and crankshaft seals.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch**

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping during gear changes, jerky acceleration, difficulty engaging gears, and unusual noises from the transmission. This is a common issue in high-performance vehicles with dual-clutch transmissions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission not shifting properly, getting stuck in gears, or displaying error messages on the dashboard. This can occur due to electrical or hydraulic issues within the unit.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, uneven ride height, and compromised handling. The LaFerrari uses advanced adaptive dampers, which can be prone to failure over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ per damper.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Hybrid System Faults**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Error messages related to the hybrid system, reduced electric motor performance, and inability to charge the hybrid battery. This can stem from various issues within the complex hybrid system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the faulty component(s), which may include the battery pack, inverter, or control modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, ranging from $2,000 - $20,000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights on the dashboard, including those related to ABS, traction control, and tire pressure monitoring. Faulty sensors can disrupt the functionality of these systems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per sensor, depending on location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Aerodynamic Component Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Damage to the active aerodynamic components such as the front splitter, rear diffuser, and rear wing. These components are vulnerable to damage from road debris and impacts.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the damaged component(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $10,000+ depending on the severity of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system freezes, glitches, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: System reset, software update, or component replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Ferrari LaFerrari, while a pinnacle of automotive engineering, is not without its potential issues. The most common concerns relate to the engine (catalytic converters, oil leaks), transmission (clutch wear, mechatronic unit), suspension (damper failure), and electrical systems (hybrid system faults, sensor malfunctions). Repairs can be very expensive given the complexity and rarity of the vehicle and its components, with costs ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars. Regular maintenance and meticulous care are crucial to minimize the risk of these issues.
