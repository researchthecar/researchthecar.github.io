The 2004 Ferrari Enzo, a pinnacle of early 2000s supercar engineering, came equipped with a single powertrain option: a naturally aspirated 6.0L F140 B V12 engine producing 651 horsepower and 485 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 6-speed automated manual (F1-style) transmission. Enzo owners appreciate its raw driving experience, iconic styling, and exclusivity, but often cite high maintenance costs and the sometimes temperamental nature of its advanced (for the time) systems as downsides.

**Engine**

**6.0L F140 B V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets, particularly around the valve covers and the rear main seal. This can result in oil consumption, visible oil puddles, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the location and extent of the leak).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a loss of power. Often caused by individual coil packs failing due to heat and age.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on how many coils are replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automated Manual (F1)**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, jerky shifts, and clutch warning lights. Due to the automated manual nature of the transmission, the clutch can wear quickly, especially with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly, including the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+ (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, transmission failure, warning lights. The F1 transmission relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the gear changes. The pump can fail due to age and wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ride Height Sensor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate ride height readings, leading to the car sitting unevenly or triggering suspension warning lights. These sensors can become corroded or damaged, especially if the car is driven in inclement weather.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ride height sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (depending on the number of sensors needing replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **ECU Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, no start condition, or difficulty starting. The ECU in these vehicles is known to have issues with age.
    *   Solution: Replacement ECU and reprogramming
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic readings, warning lights, and drivability problems. Various sensors, such as the ABS sensors, throttle position sensor, and mass airflow sensor, can fail due to age and environmental factors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the sensor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Wing Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear wing not deploying or retracting properly, or making unusual noises. The hydraulic actuators that control the wing can fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Buttons/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common issue with many Ferraris of this era. The soft-touch coating on the interior buttons and trim pieces can become sticky and unpleasant to the touch.
    *   Solution: Removing the old coating and reapplying a new finish, or replacing the affected parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the amount of trim that needs to be refinished or replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

In summary, the 2004 Ferrari Enzo, while an exceptional machine, is prone to several expensive and complex issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the F1 transmission, with potential clutch wear and hydraulic pump failures leading to very high repair costs. Engine oil leaks and electrical problems, while potentially less expensive, are still common and can be disruptive. Overall, owning and maintaining a 2004 Enzo requires deep pockets and a proactive approach to preventative maintenance.
