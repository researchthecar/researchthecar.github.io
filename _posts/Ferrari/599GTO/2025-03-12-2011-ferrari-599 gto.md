The 2011 Ferrari 599 GTO is a high-performance, limited-production version of the 599 GTB Fiorano. It came with a 6.0-liter V12 engine producing 661 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automated manual transmission (F1 SuperFast). While revered for its incredible performance and driving experience, some owners have reported specific issues that are detailed below. Owners often praise the car's visceral engine sound, sharp handling, and exclusivity, while potential downsides include high maintenance costs and occasionally temperamental electronics.

**Engine**

**6.0L V12**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop from various engine seals and gaskets, most commonly around the valve covers or oil pan. This can lead to oil consumption, visible drips, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking seals or gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the location of the leak and labor involved.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifolds can be prone to cracking, especially under high-performance driving conditions. This can result in exhaust leaks, reduced performance, and a noticeable change in exhaust sound.
    * Solution: Replacing the cracked exhaust manifold. Upgraded aftermarket manifolds are also an option.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for replacement, depending on parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed F1 SuperFast Automated Manual**

* **Clutch Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: The F1 SuperFast transmission uses a clutch, which can wear out relatively quickly with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping, jerky engagement, and difficulty shifting.
    * Solution: Replacing the clutch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hydraulic Pump Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: The F1 system relies on a hydraulic pump to operate the clutch and shifting mechanisms. These pumps can fail, leading to difficulty shifting, error messages, and potentially a complete loss of transmission function.
    * Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on parts availability and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Damper Leaks (Specifically Magnetic Ride Dampers)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 599 GTO features magnetic ride dampers, which can be prone to leaking fluid over time. This results in degraded ride quality, reduced handling performance, and visible fluid leaks.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected dampers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ per damper, depending on the shop and parts.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the vehicle (e.g., O2 sensors, ABS sensors, TPMS sensors) can fail, leading to warning lights and potential performance issues.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor and replacing it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the sensor and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the car is not driven regularly. This can be caused by parasitic draws or a failing battery.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the parasitic draw, or replacing the battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ for a new battery; diagnosis and repair of parasitic draws can vary significantly.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Sticky Buttons/Surfaces**
    * Description/Symptoms: Common in Ferraris of this era, the soft-touch coatings on interior buttons and surfaces can become sticky and deteriorate over time, particularly in hot climates.
    * Solution: Refinishing or replacing the affected parts. Several aftermarket solutions exist.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the extent of the issue and chosen solution.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Ferrari 599 GTO, while a phenomenal performance machine, can present owners with certain issues, primarily related to the engine, transmission, suspension and electronics. Oil leaks and exhaust manifold cracks can be costly to repair, while clutch wear in the F1 transmission is a common concern. Electrical glitches and suspension issues can also contribute to overall maintenance costs. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into the overall ownership experience.
