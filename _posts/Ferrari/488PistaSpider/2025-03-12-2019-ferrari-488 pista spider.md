The 2019 Ferrari 488 Pista Spider is a high-performance, open-top sports car known for its exhilarating performance and stunning design. It's powered by a 3.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 710 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque. This engine is only paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners rave about the Pista Spider's incredible acceleration, razor-sharp handling, and the intoxicating soundtrack of its engine. However, some criticisms include the firm ride, limited practicality, and the high cost of ownership.
