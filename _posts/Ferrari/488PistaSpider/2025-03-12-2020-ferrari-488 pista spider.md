The 2020 Ferrari 488 Pista Spider is a high-performance, open-top sports car that represents the pinnacle of Ferrari's engineering and design. It's powered by a 3.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 710 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Drivers love the Pista Spider for its incredible performance, razor-sharp handling, and the intoxicating sound of its engine, especially with the top down. However, the car's high price, relatively firm ride, and limited practicality are often cited as potential drawbacks.
