## Engine

### F131 V8 (3.6L)
**Sticky Manifold Flaps**
- **Symptoms:** Check engine light, rough idle, loss of power, rattling noise from intake manifold.
- **Solution:** Cleaning or replacement of the intake manifold runner flaps and associated actuators.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1,500

**Cam Belt Service Interval**
- **Symptoms:** Not a failure, but a critical maintenance item. Failure to adhere to the recommended interval (typically 3-5 years or 30,000 miles) can lead to catastrophic engine damage.
- **Solution:** Regular replacement of cam belts, tensioners, and idler pulleys.
- **Cost:** $2,000 - $4,000 (depending on shop and parts)

**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil under the car, burning oil smell, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of seals, gaskets, and O-rings, particularly around the oil cooler and valve covers.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,200


## Transmission

### F1 (Automated Manual)
**Clutch Actuator Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Slow or jerky gear changes, 'gearbox failure' warning light, inability to select gears.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential recalibration or replacement of the clutch actuator and hydraulic pump.
- **Cost:** $2,500 - $5,000+

**Hydraulic Fluid Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Low clutch pressure warning, difficulty shifting, visible fluid leaks around the transmission.
- **Solution:** Inspection and repair of hydraulic lines, seals, and pump.
- **Cost:** $800 - $2,000

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ferrari 360 is a desirable supercar with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly the manual transmission variants. The F1 automated manual transmission, while offering a unique driving experience, is more prone to costly hydraulic and actuator issues. The F131 V8 engine is robust but requires diligent adherence to its cam belt service schedule and can suffer from sticky intake manifold flaps. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and dashboard display pixel degradation, are not uncommon. Owners should budget for these potential repairs and prioritize maintenance, especially the critical cam belt service, to ensure the longevity and reliability of this iconic Ferrari.
