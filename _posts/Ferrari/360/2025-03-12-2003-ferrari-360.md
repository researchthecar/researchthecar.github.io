The 2003 Ferrari 360 Modena is a mid-engine sports car that represents a significant step forward for Ferrari in terms of design and technology. It features a lightweight aluminum spaceframe chassis and a high-revving V8 engine. The 2003 model was available in several configurations including the Modena Coupe, the Spider convertible, and the Challenge Stradale, a track-focused variant that came later in the 360's lifecycle. The 3.6L V8 engine produces around 400 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, allowing for impressive acceleration and a top speed approaching 185 mph. It was offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed "F1" automated manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the 360's striking design, exhilarating performance, and relative ease of maintenance compared to older Ferraris. Common complaints often revolve around the F1 transmission's quirks and maintenance costs, as well as the typical high running costs associated with owning an exotic sports car.
