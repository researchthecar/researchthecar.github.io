The 2006 Ferrari 360 Modena is a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its stunning design and exhilarating performance. The 2006 360 Modena is exclusively powered by a naturally aspirated 3.6-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Available transmissions include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed "F1" automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the car's iconic styling, engine sound, and engaging driving experience. Criticisms often revolve around the high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and the F1 transmission's jerky operation at low speeds and high repair costs.

**Engine**

**3.6L V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the exhaust manifolds, leading to exhaust leaks and a characteristic ticking or hissing sound, especially upon cold starts. This can eventually trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold(s) with either OEM or aftermarket alternatives.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Variator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft variator, responsible for adjusting valve timing, can fail, leading to poor performance, rough idling, and a check engine light. Noisy operation from the front of the engine may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft variator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, particularly from valve cover gaskets and the timing chain covers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the location and extent of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear is a known issue. The symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and a high clutch engagement point.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed "F1" Automated Manual**

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hydraulic pump for the F1 transmission can fail, leading to shifting problems, error messages on the dashboard, and eventually complete transmission failure. This is often related to a failing relay or low hydraulic fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the hydraulic pump and/or the faulty relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear (High Cost)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the manual transmission, the F1 transmission clutch can wear prematurely due to the automated shifting. The Clutch Wear Index (PIS) reading provides an indication of the clutch life.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the F1 clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+ (due to complexity of the F1 system and required recalibration)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 actuator, responsible for shifting gears, can fail, resulting in the inability to shift, error messages, and potential immobilization of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the F1 actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and failure of the ball joints, leading to noises (clunking), imprecise handling, and increased tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (depending on which ball joints and if control arms need to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking shock absorbers, resulting in reduced damping performance, bouncy ride, and diminished handling capabilities.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **ECU Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ECU failures, leading to various engine and transmission issues, including difficulty starting, poor performance, and error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reprogramming of the ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensor failures, including those related to the engine (O2 sensors, mass airflow sensors), transmission, and ABS system, leading to a check engine light and/or degraded performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per sensor (depending on the sensor and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Yellowing and clouding of the headlight lenses, reducing visibility at night.
    *   Solution: Professional headlight restoration or replacement of the headlight assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Parts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Degradation of the interior plastic and rubber coatings, resulting in a sticky or tacky texture on various surfaces such as dashboard components, door handles, and center console parts.
    *   Solution: Professional cleaning and recoating of the affected parts, or replacement with new parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the issue and the chosen solution)

**Summary**

The 2006 Ferrari 360 Modena, while offering a thrilling driving experience, is prone to various issues that can lead to high maintenance and repair costs. The F1 transmission, in particular, is known for its expensive clutch replacements and potential hydraulic pump/actuator failures. Engine issues such as exhaust manifold cracks and camshaft variator problems can also be costly. Electrical gremlins and interior trim degradation further contribute to the ownership expenses. Overall, prospective buyers should be prepared for potential repairs and maintenance that are typical of a high-performance exotic car of this age. The severity and cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major mechanical or electrical problems.
