The 2002 Ferrari 360 Modena is a mid-engine sports car powered by a 3.6-liter V8 engine producing 400 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automated manual transmission (F1).

Some dislike the high running costs, potential for expensive repairs, and relatively dated technology compared to modern sports cars.

**Engine**

**3.6L V8**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks can develop in the exhaust manifolds, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a hissing or ticking sound from the engine bay, reduced performance, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold. Upgraded aftermarket manifolds are available to address the cracking issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt tensioner can fail, leading to improper timing belt tension and potential engine damage if not addressed quickly. Symptoms can include unusual engine noise, rough running, or a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, tensioner, and idler pulleys. It's recommended to perform this service every 3-5 years, regardless of mileage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (includes parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Variator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft variators, responsible for variable valve timing, can fail over time. Symptoms include reduced performance, especially at lower RPMs, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft variator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on which variator(s) need replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**6-Speed F1 Automated Manual**

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 system relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the clutch and shift gears. These pumps are known to fail, leading to shifting problems, error messages on the dashboard, and eventually complete inability to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace the hydraulic pump. It's also recommended to inspect and potentially replace the F1 relay, as a faulty relay can contribute to pump failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 system can cause premature clutch wear due to its automated operation, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping clutch, difficulty engaging gears, and eventually complete clutch failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The position sensors, responsible for telling the computer the position of the transmission, can fail over time. Symptoms include shifting problems, error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the Position Sensor(s)
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ball joints in the suspension can wear out, leading to loose handling, clunking noises, and potential safety concerns.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The shock absorbers can leak fluid, leading to reduced damping performance and a bouncy ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sticky Interior Switches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The interior switches can become sticky due to the decomposition of the coating. This makes it difficult to use the switch or may not allow it to work at all.
    *   Solution: The parts can be removed and refinished. Some prefer to replace the switches entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per switch.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixelation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD screen in the instrument cluster can suffer from pixelation, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: The instrument cluster can be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
