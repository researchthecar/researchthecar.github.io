### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ferrari 360 is a desirable supercar with a generally solid mechanical foundation, but its complexity and performance nature mean certain components require diligent maintenance and can be costly to repair. The V8 engine, while powerful, is susceptible to issues like sticky valves and requires strict adherence to cam belt service intervals to prevent catastrophic failure. The F1 transmission, a marvel of engineering, is more prone to electrical and hydraulic issues than the manual counterpart, with potential for significant repair bills. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the F1 system and window regulators, are also noted. Despite these potential issues, with proper care and proactive maintenance, the 360 remains a rewarding and reliable exotic car.
