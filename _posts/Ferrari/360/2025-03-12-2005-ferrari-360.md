**Engine**

**3.6L V8**
*   **Camshaft Variator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise at idle or low RPMs, especially when the engine is cold. This is due to wear or failure of the camshaft variators, which control valve timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft variators and potentially associated components like timing chains and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leak noise, reduced performance, and a possible exhaust smell inside the cabin. Cracks commonly develop in the exhaust manifolds due to heat cycling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifolds. Upgraded aftermarket manifolds may offer increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level warning. Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and timing chain cover.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Airbag ECU Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag light illuminated on the instrument cluster. Fault codes indicate issues with the airbag ECU.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reprogramming of the airbag ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**
*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty engaging gears, and a high clutch pedal engagement point. Clutch wear is a common issue due to the high-performance nature of the car.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed F1 Automated Manual**
*   **F1 Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, warning lights on the dashboard related to the F1 system, and potential inability to select gears. The F1 pump is responsible for hydraulic pressure in the automated manual system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the F1 pump. It is often recommended to also replace the F1 relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Clutch Wear (F1 System)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the manual transmission, the F1 system clutch can wear out, leading to slippage and difficulty shifting. F1 clutches tend to wear faster than manual clutches due to the system managing the clutch engagement.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing. Additionally, the F1 system may require recalibration after clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, gear selection issues, and warning lights. Several sensors within the F1 system can fail, including gear position sensors and pressure sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the sensor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the suspension, loose handling, and uneven tire wear. Ball joints are prone to wear due to the vehicle's performance and age.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Failure**
