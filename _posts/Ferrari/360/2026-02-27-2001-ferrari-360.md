### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ferrari 360 Modena is a capable and generally reliable supercar, especially when considering its exotic nature. The V8 engine, while requiring diligent maintenance like cam belt changes, is robust. The manual transmission is largely trouble-free. However, the F1 automated manual transmission can present specific issues with its pump and actuators, which are common to such systems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and dashboard illumination, can occur. Owners should prioritize regular servicing, especially cam belt replacement, and be prepared for potential costs associated with the F1 transmission and minor electrical faults. Overall, with proper care and attention to its known weak points, the 360 can be a rewarding ownership experience.
