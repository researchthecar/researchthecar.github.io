### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ferrari 360 Modena, while a desirable supercar, requires diligent maintenance and awareness of potential issues, particularly with its F1 transmission and the complex V8 engine. The automated manual transmission's clutch actuator and hydraulic system are known points of concern, often leading to significant repair costs. Engine-wise, preventative maintenance like cam belt replacement is critical, and issues such as sticky valves and oil leaks can arise. Electrical gremlins, especially with control modules and window regulators, are also documented. Despite these potential drawbacks, the manual transmission variants are generally more robust. Regular servicing by marque specialists is paramount to mitigating these risks and preserving the car's performance and value.
