**Introduction**

The 2006 Ferrari 360 is a mid-engine sports car powered by a 3.6-liter V8 engine. Available with a 6-speed manual or an optional 6-speed F1 automated manual transmission (AMT), the 360 produces 415 horsepower and 342 lb-ft of torque. Praised for its performance, handling, and design, the 360 is also notorious for certain issues.

**Engine**

**3.6-liter V8**

* **Oil Leaks from Cam Cover Gaskets:** Leaks develop due to faulty gaskets between the cam covers and cylinder heads. Replacing the gaskets is necessary to prevent oil leaks and potential engine damage. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Failed Airflow Sensors:** Sensors malfunctions can cause a decrease in engine power, hesitation, and increased fuel consumption. Replacing the faulty sensor is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
* **Clogged Fuel Injectors:** Injectors may become clogged over time, resulting in rough idling, misfires, and decreased fuel economy. Cleaning or replacing the injectors is recommended. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Failure:** Premature clutch wear can occur, causing slippage, difficulty shifting, and a burnt clutch smell. Replacing the clutch and related components is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
* **Hard Shifting:** Sticky synchros can make shifting difficult, especially when the transmission is cold. Replacing the synchros or performing a transmission rebuild may be required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+

**6-Speed F1 AMT**

* **Electro-Hydraulic Pump Failure:** The pump that actuates the gears may fail, causing gear changes to become erratic or impossible. Replacing the pump is essential to restore proper transmission function. Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
* **Clutch Actuator Failure:** A faulty clutch actuator can prevent the clutch from engaging or disengaging, resulting in difficulty starting or operating the vehicle. Repair or replacement of the actuator is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

**Suspension**

* **Leaking Shock Absorbers:** Worn shock absorber seals may leak fluid, affecting ride quality and handling. Replacing the shock absorbers is recommended. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may malfunction, leading to battery drain and electrical system problems. Replacing the alternator is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic drain may occur due to faulty wiring or components, causing the battery to discharge even when the car is turned off. Identifying and fixing the source of the drain is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Recalls:** None Found

**Exterior**

* **Clear Coat Peeling:** The clear coat on the paint may peel or flake off over time, exposing the base coat. Touch-up painting or a complete repaint is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+

**Interior**

* **Door Panel Creaking:** Door panels may creak or rattle at certain speeds due to loose mounting points or worn components. Retightening or replacing the affected parts usually solves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
* **Dashboard Squeaks:** Squeaks or rattles from the dashboard may be caused by loose components or vibrations. Identifying and fixing the source of the noise is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Summary**

The 2006 Ferrari 360 is prone to various issues, with engine, transmission, and electrical problems being the most prevalent. Oil leaks, clutch failures, and alternator breakdowns are among the more serious and costly issues. While interior and exterior issues are less severe, they can still affect the overall ownership experience. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the location of the repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchase decision.
