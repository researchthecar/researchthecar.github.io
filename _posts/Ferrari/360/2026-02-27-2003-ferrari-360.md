### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ferrari 360 Modena is a highly desirable supercar with a generally solid mechanical foundation, especially for its era. The naturally aspirated V8 engine is a strong point, though routine cam belt service is critical to prevent catastrophic failure. The F1 transmission, while offering rapid shifts, is more prone to hydraulic and actuator issues than the manual gearbox, which is largely trouble-free. Electrical gremlins, particularly dashboard warnings, can occur and require thorough diagnosis. Owners should budget for specialized maintenance and potential repairs, especially concerning the F1 system and engine-related seals. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and care, the 360 remains a rewarding and reliable exotic.
