**Summary**

While the 2019 Ferrari 488 GTB offers an incredible driving experience, potential owners should be aware of the common issues reported. Engine problems, particularly turbocharger failure and oil leaks, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially clutch wear and mechatronic unit problems, also represent significant expenses. Electrical gremlins and suspension damper failures are other areas to consider. Due to the complexity and high cost of Ferrari parts and labor, addressing these issues can be very expensive, potentially exceeding $10,000 for major repairs. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a comprehensive service history are essential.
