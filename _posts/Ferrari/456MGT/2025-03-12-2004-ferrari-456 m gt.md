The 2004 Ferrari 456M GT is a grand tourer known for its elegant styling, comfortable interior, and powerful V12 engine. The "M" designation signifies "Modificata," indicating several improvements over the original 456. The 2004 model year represents the final year of production. It came equipped with a 5.5-liter V12 engine producing 436 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission were the available transmission options. Owners often appreciate the car's blend of performance and practicality, making it a more usable Ferrari for long journeys. However, common complaints revolve around high maintenance costs, especially related to the engine, electrical systems, and specific components that are prone to failure due to age.

**Engine**

**5.5L V12**

*   **Camshaft Variator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, particularly when cold. The sound typically disappears as the engine warms up. This is caused by a failure of the hydraulically actuated cam variators. This affects valve timing and can lead to reduced performance and eventual engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft variators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ depending on labor and whether other related components need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially when cold, that gets quieter as the engine warms up. Also, a noticeable exhaust leak detected by smell or visual inspection. Cracks often develop due to heat stress.
    *   Solution: Welding the cracks or, more commonly, replacing the exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on whether welding is possible and the cost of the new manifold.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Hose Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks. The original coolant hoses are known to degrade over time, leading to leaks and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of all coolant hoses with updated materials.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the number of hoses replaced and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Throwout Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squealing or grinding noise when the clutch pedal is depressed. Difficulty shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the throwout bearing and often the clutch assembly as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on labor and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or jerky shifting, lack of power, and difficulty maintaining speed. The transmission may slip between gears. This is often due to worn clutch packs or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Self-Leveling Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension sags or fails to maintain the correct ride height. Error messages related to the suspension system are displayed on the dashboard. This is due to failures within the hydraulic system responsible for self-leveling.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the hydraulic pumps, accumulators, or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and which components need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dashboard Pixel Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the instrument cluster LCD screen become unreadable or disappear altogether. This is a common issue with the LCD screens of this era.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the LCD screen. Some specialists offer pixel repair services.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ECU Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various engine performance problems, difficulty starting, and diagnostic trouble codes related to the engine control unit. The ECU can be prone to failure due to age and heat.
    *   Solution: ECU repair or replacement. Requires specialized programming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to operate correctly, either moving slowly or not at all. The window regulators are known to be weak and fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or both headlights failing to raise or lower correctly. This is due to the electric motors failing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many of the interior plastic surfaces, particularly on the center console and switches, develop a sticky or tacky texture. This is due to the degradation of the soft-touch coating used by Ferrari.
    *   Solution: Removal of the sticky coating and refinishing the parts, or replacement of the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the number of parts refinished or replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Ferrari 456M GT is a rewarding car to own but comes with its fair share of potential issues. The camshaft variator and exhaust manifold issues on the engine, combined with the transmission problems and self-leveling suspension issues, can lead to significant repair bills. Electrical problems, such as dashboard pixel failure and ECU issues, also contribute to the maintenance burden. The "sticky" interior trim is a common cosmetic complaint. While these issues can be expensive to fix, addressing them proactively can help ensure the longevity and enjoyment of this classic grand tourer. The severity and cost of repairs are generally moderate to high, depending on the specific issue.
