The 2003 Ferrari 456 M GT is a grand tourer known for its elegant Pininfarina design, comfortable interior, and powerful V12 engine. It came exclusively with a 5.5-liter V12 engine producing around 436 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission was standard, with a 4-speed automatic being optional. Owners generally praise the 456 M GT for its smooth power delivery, luxurious interior, and comfortable ride, making it a capable long-distance cruiser. Common dislikes often revolve around the high maintenance costs associated with owning a Ferrari, particularly regarding the complex mechanical and electrical systems, as well as the engine's propensity to burn oil.
