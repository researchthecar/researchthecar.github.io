# 2020 Ferrari SF90 Stradale

### Overview
The 2020 Ferrari SF90 Stradale represents a pinnacle of automotive engineering, blending a potent V8 twin-turbocharged engine with a sophisticated hybrid powertrain. As a hypercar, its design prioritizes performance and cutting-edge technology. Reliability data for such exclusive vehicles is often less publicly documented than for mass-produced cars, with owners typically experiencing issues related to the complexity of the hybrid system or high-performance components. However, Ferrari's rigorous testing and quality control aim to mitigate widespread problems. Owners should expect that maintenance and potential repairs will be specialized and costly, reflecting the exotic nature of the vehicle. The focus is on delivering an unparalleled driving experience, with reliability being a secondary, albeit important, consideration for this segment.

### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Ferrari SF90 Stradale, while a marvel of performance and technology, carries the inherent complexities of a hybrid hypercar. The primary areas of potential concern revolve around the sophisticated hybrid powertrain, including the high-voltage battery system and its management, as well as the integration of electric motors with the V8 engine and dual-clutch transmission. These systems, while advanced, can be prone to software glitches or component failures, leading to significant repair costs. The V8 engine itself is robust, but turbocharger actuators can be a point of failure. Other systems like suspension, exterior, and interior components generally exhibit good reliability, consistent with Ferrari's build quality. Owners should budget for specialized maintenance and potential high-cost repairs, particularly related to the hybrid technology.
