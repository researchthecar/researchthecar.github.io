The 2023 Ferrari SF90 Stradale is a high-performance plug-in hybrid supercar, boasting a staggering 986 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque from its hybrid powertrain. The heart of the SF90 Stradale is a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine paired with three electric motors (two on the front axle and one between the engine and transmission). It uses an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners praise the SF90 Stradale for its incredible acceleration, advanced technology, and stunning design. However, some common complaints include the complex hybrid system leading to potential reliability issues, the low ground clearance making it prone to scraping, and the high cost of ownership.
