### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ferrari FF, while a remarkable feat of engineering, presents potential reliability concerns primarily in its complex powertrain and advanced suspension systems. Owners should be aware of possible issues with coolant leaks and exhaust manifold cracks in the V12 engine, and potential failures within the dual-clutch transmission's mechatronic unit or clutch packs. The magnetorheological dampers are also a noted area for potential expense. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, can also arise. Despite these points, the exterior and interior components generally hold up well. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these risks and ensuring the longevity of this exotic grand tourer.
