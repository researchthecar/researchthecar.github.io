The 2014 Ferrari FF is a groundbreaking grand tourer, known for its distinctive shooting-brake design and Ferrari's first application of all-wheel drive. This model is powered by a naturally aspirated 6.3-liter V12 engine, producing a staggering 651 horsepower and 504 lb-ft of torque. This powerful engine is paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the FF for its exceptional performance, luxurious interior, and surprisingly practical nature, thanks to its four-seat configuration and generous cargo space. Common complaints revolve around the car's high running costs, complex electronics, and polarizing exterior styling.

**Summary**

The 2014 Ferrari FF, while a remarkable vehicle, is not without its potential issues. The most common concerns involve the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Engine oil leaks and catalytic converter failures are notable engine issues, while the transmission can suffer from clutch wear and Mechatronic unit problems. Suspension issues often stem from the Magneride dampers. Electrical gremlins, particularly battery drain and sensor failures, are also frequently reported. Interior and exterior issues are less prevalent but still worth noting. The costs associated with these repairs can be significant, reflecting the complexity and exotic nature of the vehicle. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in the potential for high maintenance costs when considering a 2014 Ferrari FF.
