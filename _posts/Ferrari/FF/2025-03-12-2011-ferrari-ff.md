The 2011 Ferrari FF marked a departure for Ferrari, introducing a four-wheel-drive system and a shooting-brake design, which has gathered mixed reviews. This model year features a single engine option, a 6.3-liter naturally aspirated V12 engine producing 651 horsepower and 504 lb-ft of torque. The FF is appreciated for its powerful engine, unique styling, and all-weather capability, although some criticize its unconventional looks and high maintenance costs. It is only available with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.
