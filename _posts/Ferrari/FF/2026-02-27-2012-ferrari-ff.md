### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ferrari FF, while a remarkable feat of engineering, presents potential reliability concerns typical of a high-performance exotic. The V12 engine and dual-clutch transmission are generally robust but can incur significant costs for repairs like oil leaks, coolant issues, mechatronic unit failures, or clutch pack wear. The advanced magnetorheological suspension, while providing exceptional handling, is a known area for expensive component failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also reported. Exterior paint and interior leather can show wear, requiring specialized attention. Owners should budget for premium maintenance and potential repairs, as parts and labor for a Ferrari are considerably higher than for mainstream vehicles.
