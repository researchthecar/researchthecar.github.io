**Transmission**

**6-Speed F1 SuperFast Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear is a common issue with the F1 transmission due to its automated nature. Slipping during gear changes, difficulty engaging gears, and related warning lights on the dash indicate potential problems.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is necessary when wear reaches a critical point.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 transmission relies on hydraulic actuators for gear selection. These actuators can fail, resulting in inability to shift gears or erratic shifting behavior.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the F1 pump or actuator
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

* No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetorheological Damper (Magneride) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Magneride dampers, which use a special fluid to adjust damping characteristics, can leak or fail. This leads to reduced ride quality, uneven handling, and warning messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, including those related to engine management, ABS, and traction control, can fail, leading to warning lights and performance issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ECU Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported failures of the engine control unit (ECU), leading to a variety of performance problems and diagnostic error codes.
    *   Solution: ECU repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headlight lenses can sometimes delaminate, causing a cloudy appearance.
    *   Solution: Headlight replacement or refinishing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ per headlight
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue with Ferraris of this era is the "sticky" interior trim. The soft-touch coating on various interior parts (e.g., dashboard, center console) can degrade and become sticky to the touch.
    *   Solution: Refinishing or replacement of the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent and parts involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2007 Ferrari 599 GTB is a high-performance vehicle with associated high maintenance costs. The most common issues relate to drivetrain components, particularly the F1 automated manual transmission's clutch wear and actuator failures. Electrical sensor issues and ECU failures are also prevalent. Many of these issues can be costly to repair, reflecting the complexity and performance-oriented design of the car. Owners should be prepared for potential expenses related to clutch replacements, hydraulic system repairs, and electrical system diagnostics. The sticky interior trim is also a known annoyance, though it's largely cosmetic. Overall, while the 599 GTB offers an exhilarating driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of the potential for expensive repairs.
