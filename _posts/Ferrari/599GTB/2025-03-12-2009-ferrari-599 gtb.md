The 2009 Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano is a grand tourer known for its powerful V12 engine, elegant design, and exceptional performance. It came standard with a 6.0-liter V12 engine producing 612 horsepower and 448 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automated manual F1 transmission. A traditional 6-speed manual was also offered. Owners appreciate the 599 GTB for its exhilarating driving experience, luxurious interior, and iconic Ferrari styling. However, some have noted the relatively high running costs, including maintenance and fuel consumption, and the complexity of the F1 transmission can be a concern.
