**Engine**

**6.0L V12**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and timing chain cover. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is the typical solution. In some cases, resealing the entire engine may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Guides Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the valve guides can lead to oil consumption and reduced engine performance. Symptoms include excessive blue smoke from the exhaust, especially upon start-up, and a ticking noise from the valve train.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn valve guides and potentially the valves themselves is required. This is a major engine repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $15,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automated Manual (F1)**

* **Clutch Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: The automated manual transmission relies on a clutch for gear changes. Clutch wear is a common issue, particularly with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping, difficulty engaging gears, and a high-pitched squealing noise during gear changes.
    * Solution: Replacing the clutch is the standard solution. The clutch wear can be greatly increased if the vehicle is frequently used in stop-and-go traffic.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (includes clutch, labor, and potentially other related components).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hydraulic Pump Failure (F1 System)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The F1 transmission system uses a hydraulic pump to operate the clutch and gear changes. Pump failure can lead to difficulty shifting gears, transmission warning lights, and ultimately, the inability to drive the car.
    * Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump and potentially related components like the accumulator is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Damper Issues (Magnetorheological Dampers)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 599 GTB often features magnetorheological dampers. These dampers can leak fluid or fail, leading to a deterioration in ride quality and handling. Symptoms include a bouncy or harsh ride, uneven tire wear, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty dampers is the usual fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ for a set of dampers, including labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the car can fail, leading to a range of issues. Common culprits include oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and ABS sensors. Symptoms include check engine lights, poor engine performance, and ABS/traction control issues.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor and replacing it is the solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per sensor, depending on the location and type of sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: A common issue with many luxury vehicles is excessive battery drain. This can be caused by a faulty module not shutting down properly, an aging battery, or parasitic draw from aftermarket accessories.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the source of the drain and replacing the battery or faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the cause.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Condensation can build up inside the headlight housings, especially in humid climates. This can reduce headlight output and potentially damage the headlight assembly.
    * Solution: Removing the headlight assembly, drying it out, and resealing it. In some cases, the entire headlight assembly may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the complexity of the repair and whether a new assembly is required.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sticky Interior Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some interior trim pieces, particularly those coated with a soft-touch material, can become sticky and degrade over time, especially in hot climates.
    * Solution: Refinishing or replacing the affected trim pieces.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the number of pieces and the chosen repair method.
    * Recalls: None Found
