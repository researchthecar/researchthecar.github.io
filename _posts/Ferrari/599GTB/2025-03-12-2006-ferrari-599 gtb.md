**Engine**

**6.0L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often stemming from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or crankshaft seals. Symptoms include visible oil puddles under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the exhaust manifolds, particularly on early models, can occur due to heat cycling. Symptoms include exhaust leaks, a ticking noise (especially when cold), and potential loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cracked exhaust manifold(s). Aftermarket options may offer improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ per manifold, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Variator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the camshaft variators (adjusters) can lead to rough idling, reduced power, and engine warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft variators and potentially associated solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ depending on how many variators need replacing and labor.

    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 transmission utilizes a single-clutch system. Clutch wear is a common issue due to the nature of the automated shifting. Symptoms include slipping clutch, jerky shifts, and difficulty engaging gears. Premature failure of the clutch position sensor can also affect clutch performance.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement. Sensor replacement, if applicable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ including labor, depending on the shop and whether it's Ferrari OE or aftermarket.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **F1 Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 system relies on a hydraulic pump to operate the gearshifts. These pumps can fail over time, leading to slow or failed gear changes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the F1 pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gear Position Sensor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty gear position sensors can cause incorrect gear selection, transmission malfunctions, and error messages.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ including labor, depending on the number of sensors and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetorheological Damper (Magneride) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 599 GTB often came equipped with Magneride adaptive dampers. These can leak or fail over time, resulting in poor ride quality, uneven handling, and error messages.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty Magneride damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ per damper, including labor. Replacing them in pairs is recommended.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster/Dashboard Display Issues**

    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on repair vs. replacement and the shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain is sometimes reported, potentially due to parasitic drains from various modules.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the source of the parasitic drain (e.g., faulty module, wiring issue).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the complexity of the diagnosis and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Various)**

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft-touch interior trim pieces (often around the center console and dashboard) can become sticky and degrade over time. This is a common issue with many Ferraris of this era.

**Summary**

The 2006 Ferrari 599 GTB, while an exceptional vehicle, has some potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine oil leaks and exhaust manifold cracks can be costly to address. The F1 transmission's clutch wear and potential pump failures are also significant concerns. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the instrument cluster and battery drain, can be frustrating. The sticky interior trim is a cosmetic issue but detracts from the overall experience. Overall, while the severity of the issues can vary, the potential repair costs can be substantial, so a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
