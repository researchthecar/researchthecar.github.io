The 2008 Ferrari 599 GTB is a high-performance grand tourer produced by Ferrari from 2006 to 2012. It is powered by a 6.0-liter V12 engine that produces 612 horsepower and 448 lb-ft of torque. The 599 GTB is available with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automated manual transmission called the F1 SuperFast.

People who like the 599 GTB praise its powerful engine, sharp handling, and luxurious interior. However, some people dislike its high price and lack of rear legroom.

**Engine**

**6.0L V12**

* **Intake camshaft failure:** This issue can cause the engine to lose power or stall. The intake camshaft is responsible for opening and closing the intake valves, which allows air and fuel to enter the cylinders. When the intake camshaft fails, the valves can no longer open and close properly, which can lead to a loss of power or even engine failure. Symptoms of intake camshaft failure include a loss of power, a rough idle, and a check engine light. The solution to this problem is to replace the intake camshaft. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $2,000 - $4,000.
* **Exhaust manifold cracking:** This issue can cause a loss of power and a decrease in fuel economy. The exhaust manifold is responsible for collecting exhaust gases from the engine and directing them to the exhaust system. When the exhaust manifold cracks, exhaust gases can leak out, which can lead to a loss of power and a decrease in fuel economy. Symptoms of exhaust manifold cracking include a loss of power, a decrease in fuel economy, and a loud exhaust noise. The solution to this problem is to replace the exhaust manifold. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $1,000 - $2,000.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Synchronizer failure:** This issue can make it difficult to shift gears. The synchronizer is a component of the transmission that helps to align the gears so that they can mesh smoothly. When the synchronizer fails, it can make it difficult to shift gears, and it can also cause grinding noises. Symptoms of synchronizer failure include difficulty shifting gears and grinding noises. The solution to this problem is to replace the synchronizer. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $500 - $1,000.
* **Clutch failure:** This issue can cause the car to lose power. The clutch is a component of the transmission that engages and disengages the engine from the transmission. When the clutch fails, the engine can no longer transmit power to the transmission, which can cause the car to lose power. Symptoms of clutch failure include a loss of power, a slipping clutch, and a burning smell. The solution to this problem is to replace the clutch. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $2,000 - $4,000.

**6-Speed Automated Manual (F1 SuperFast)**

* **F1 насос failure:** This issue can cause the transmission to malfunction. The F1 насос is a component of the transmission that provides hydraulic pressure to the clutch and shift actuators. When the F1 насос fails, the clutch and shift actuators can no longer operate properly, which can cause the transmission to malfunction. Symptoms of F1 насос failure include difficulty shifting gears, a loss of power, and a check engine light. The solution to this problem is to replace the F1 насос. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $2,000 - $4,000.
* **E-diff failure:** This issue can cause the car to lose traction. The E-diff is a component of the transmission that controls the distribution of torque between the rear wheels. When the E-diff fails, the car can lose traction, which can make it difficult to control. Symptoms of E-diff failure include a loss of traction, a loud noise from the rear of the car, and a check engine light. The solution to this problem is to replace the E-diff. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $3,000 - $5,000.

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension strut failure:** This issue can cause the car to lose control. The front suspension struts are responsible for absorbing shock and keeping the tires in contact with the road. When the front suspension struts fail, the car can lose control, which can lead to an accident. Symptoms of front suspension strut failure include a loss of control, a rough ride, and a loud noise from the front of the car. The solution to this problem is to replace the front suspension struts. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $1,000 - $2,000.
* **Rear suspension spring failure:** This issue can cause the car to sag in the rear. The rear suspension springs are responsible for supporting the weight of the car. When the rear suspension springs fail, the car can sag in the rear, which can make it difficult to handle. Symptoms of rear suspension spring failure include a sagging rear end, a rough ride, and a loud noise from the rear of the car. The solution to this problem is to replace the rear suspension springs. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $500 - $1,000.

**Electrical**

* **Battery failure:** This issue can prevent the car from starting. The battery is responsible for providing power to the car's electrical components. When the battery fails, the car can no longer start. Symptoms of battery failure include a dead battery, a dim interior light, and a slow starter motor. The solution to this problem is to replace the battery. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $200 - $400.
* **Alternator failure:** This issue can prevent the car from charging. The alternator is responsible for charging the battery. When the alternator fails, the battery can no longer be charged, which can lead to a dead battery. Symptoms of alternator failure include a dead battery, a dim interior light, and a slow starter motor. The solution to this problem is to replace the alternator. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $500 - $1,000.

**Exterior**

* **No major issues found.**

**Interior**

* **HVAC system failure:** This issue can cause the car to overheat or freeze. The HVAC system is responsible for heating and cooling the car's interior. When the HVAC system fails, the car can overheat or freeze, which can make it uncomfortable to drive. Symptoms of HVAC system failure include a lack of heat or air conditioning, a loud noise from the HVAC system, and a burning smell. The solution to this problem is to repair or replace the HVAC system. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $500 - $1,000.
* **Navigation system failure:** This issue can make it difficult to find your way. The navigation system is responsible for providing directions to the driver. When the navigation system fails, it can be difficult to find your way, which can lead to getting lost. Symptoms of navigation system failure include a blank screen, a frozen screen, and an incorrect voice guidance. The solution to this problem is to repair or replace the navigation system. The estimated cost to fix this issue is $500 - $1,000.
