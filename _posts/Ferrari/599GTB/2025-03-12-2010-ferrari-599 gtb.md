Common complaints revolve around the high running costs associated with Ferrari ownership and the potential for expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**6.0L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various areas, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front timing cover. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, oil consumption, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal. Thoroughly clean the affected area before installing the new component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the source and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks may develop in the exhaust manifolds, particularly in areas with high thermal stress. Symptoms include an exhaust leak sound, reduced performance, and potential for catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cracked exhaust manifold with a new or upgraded unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (including parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed F1 SuperFast Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 transmission relies on an automated clutch system that can wear out relatively quickly, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include clutch slippage, difficulty engaging gears, and error messages related to the clutch system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly, including the clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing. Recalibrating the F1 system after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 transmission uses a hydraulic pump to actuate gear changes. This pump can fail over time, leading to slow or erratic shifting. Symptoms include delays in gear changes, warning lights related to the F1 system, and inability to select gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hydraulic pump and potentially associated components (relay, accumulator). Flushing and refilling the hydraulic fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Suspension Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rubber bushings in the suspension system can deteriorate over time, leading to excessive play and noise. Symptoms include clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings. In some cases, replacing the entire suspension arm may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the bushings and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magnetic Ride Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with magnetic ride control, the shocks can leak or fail causing the ride to be bouncy and unstable.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shocks or having them rebuilt
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many Ferrari owners report issues with battery drain, especially when the car is not driven regularly. This can be caused by various factors, including parasitic drains from the alarm system, infotainment system, or other electronic components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic drain. Using a battery tender when the car is stored for extended periods.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sensors related to the engine, transmission, and other systems can fail, leading to warning lights and performance issues. Common examples include oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and wheel speed sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor using diagnostic equipment and replacing it with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the sensor and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation can build up inside the headlight housings, especially in humid conditions. This can reduce headlight output and potentially damage the headlight components.
    *   Solution: Sealing the headlight housings to prevent moisture intrusion. Replacing the headlight assembly if the condensation is severe or has caused damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2010 Ferrari 599 GTB vehicles experienced issues with sticky interior components due to the degradation of a coating applied to plastic surfaces. This can affect door handles, center console trim, and other areas.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the sticky surfaces using specialized products or refinishing the components with a new coating. Replacing the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the issue and the chosen solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano, while a remarkable machine, is not without its potential issues. Engine oil leaks and exhaust manifold cracks can be expensive to address. The F1 transmission, while offering engaging performance, is prone to clutch wear and hydraulic pump failures, leading to substantial repair bills. Electrical issues, particularly battery drain, are also relatively common. Sticky interior components can detract from the overall ownership experience. While some issues are relatively minor, many can be costly to repair, making pre-purchase inspection and careful maintenance crucial for prospective buyers.
