### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Ferrari 599 GTB is a remarkably reliable supercar, especially considering its performance capabilities. The V12 engine is a strong point, with no widespread issues reported. The primary areas of concern tend to be the sophisticated F1 transmission, particularly the clutch actuator and hydraulic systems, and the adaptive suspension dampers, which can be costly to repair if they fail. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also noted but generally manageable. Exterior and interior components, while subject to wear, do not present systemic reliability problems. Overall, the 599 GTB offers a robust ownership experience for those prepared for the specialized maintenance and costs associated with a high-performance Ferrari.
