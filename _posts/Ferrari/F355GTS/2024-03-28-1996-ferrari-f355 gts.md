**Introduction:**

The 1996 Ferrari F355 GTS is an Italian mid-engined sports car produced from 1994 to 1999. It is powered by a 3.5-liter V8 engine and comes with a 6-speed manual transmission. The F355 GTS has a top speed of 183 mph and can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds. It is known for its handling, performance, and iconic design. However, some owners have reported issues with the F355 GTS, which are detailed below.

**Engine**

* **3.5L V8**
  * **Valve Guide Wear:** Over time, the valve guides can wear out, causing excessive oil consumption and reduced engine power. Replacing the valve guides and seals is the solution, with an estimated cost of $2,500 - $3,500+.
* **Intake Manifold Cracks:** The intake manifold can develop cracks, leading to vacuum leaks and reduced engine performance. Replacing the cracked intake manifold is the solution, with an estimated cost of $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Engine Mounts Failure:** The engine mounts can fail, causing excessive engine vibration. Replacing the failed engine mounts is the solution, with an estimated cost of $500 - $1,000+.

**Transmission**

* **6-Speed Manual**
  * **Clutch Slippage:** The clutch can slip, causing loss of power and difficulty shifting gears. Replacing the worn clutch and pressure plate is the solution, with an estimated cost of $1,500 - $2,000+.
  * **Synchro Failure:** The synchronizers in the transmission can fail, making it difficult or impossible to shift gears. Replacing the failed synchronizers is the solution, with an estimated cost of $1,000 - $2,500+.

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushings Wear:** The front control arm bushings can wear out, leading to excessive play and reduced handling. Replacing the worn bushings is the solution, with an estimated cost of $300 - $500+.
* **Rear Shock Absorbers Failure:** The rear shock absorbers can fail, causing reduced ride quality and handling. Replacing the failed shock absorbers is the solution, with an estimated cost of $500 - $1,000+.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, leaving the battery without a charge. Replacing the failed alternator is the solution, with an estimated cost of $500 - $1,000+.
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely due to a faulty electrical component or parasitic drain. Identifying and replacing the faulty component or fixing the parasitic drain is the solution, with an estimated cost of $200 - $1,000+.
* **Faulty Engine Control Module (ECM):** The ECM can malfunction, affecting engine performance and drivability. Replacing the ECM is the solution, with an estimated cost of $1,500 - $2,000+.
