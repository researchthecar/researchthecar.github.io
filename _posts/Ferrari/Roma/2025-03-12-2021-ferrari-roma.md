**Summary**

The 2021 Ferrari Roma, while praised for its performance and design, has some reported issues. The most concerning seem to be related to the engine's oil leaks and potential wastegate issues, as well as the transmission's shifting smoothness and clutch slippage, though these are more likely to be covered under warranty. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system, are also present. Given the car's price point, even seemingly minor issues can be frustrating. Potential buyers should be aware of these reported issues and thoroughly inspect any prospective vehicle, ideally obtaining a pre-purchase inspection from a reputable Ferrari specialist. The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to upwards of $10,000, depending on the severity and whether warranty coverage is available.
