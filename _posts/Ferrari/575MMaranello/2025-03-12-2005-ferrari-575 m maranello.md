The 2005 Ferrari 575M Maranello is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive grand tourer that represents a significant step forward from its predecessor, the 550 Maranello. Power comes from a 5.7-liter V12 engine, producing 515 horsepower and 434 lb-ft of torque. This engine was offered with either a traditional 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automated manual transmission known as "F1." The 575M Maranello is lauded for its exceptional performance, comfortable ride, and elegant styling, making it a desirable grand tourer. However, some owners have reported issues related to the F1 transmission, sticky interior trim, and general maintenance costs associated with a high-performance Italian vehicle.

    *   Solution: Replace the F1 pump. Upgraded pumps are available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The actuators control the shifting process. Actuators can fail, causing shifting issues or complete immobilization.
    *   Solution: Replace the actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front suspension ball joints are prone to wear. This can cause a clunking noise during suspension movement, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**

    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that has failed and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drain issues are relatively common, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can be due to a parasitic draw from various systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and eliminate the parasitic draw. Using a battery tender is recommended for storage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headlight lenses can become cloudy or yellowed over time, reducing light output.
    *   Solution: Polish the headlight lenses or replace the headlight assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (polishing), $1000 - $3000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **"Sticky" Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft-touch plastic used on some interior trim pieces can become sticky and deteriorate over time, a common issue in many Ferraris of this era.
    *   Solution: Refinish the affected trim pieces by removing the sticky coating or replace the trim pieces entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent and method of repair)

**Summary**

The 2005 Ferrari 575M Maranello is a desirable grand tourer with impressive performance. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as oil leaks, exhaust manifold cracks, F1 transmission problems (if equipped), and sticky interior trim. The F1 transmission issues, in particular, can be costly to repair. While many issues are relatively minor, repair costs can quickly escalate due to the specialized nature of the car and the cost of parts. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Ferrari mechanic is highly recommended.
