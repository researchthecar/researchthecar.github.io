Some owners appreciate the car's unique blend of performance and grand touring comfort, while others may find the running costs and potential for mechanical issues to be a concern. The F12 is generally known to be a reliable car, but issues do exist and are detailed below.

**Engine**

**6.3L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may develop from various engine seals and gaskets, including the valve cover gaskets and the oil pan gasket. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine or on the garage floor, a burning oil smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected seals or gaskets is necessary. This can be a labor-intensive process, especially for the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+

*   **Exhaust Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the exhaust manifolds, particularly in areas subjected to high thermal stress, can occur. This leads to exhaust leaks, a noticeable increase in engine noise, and potential performance degradation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked exhaust manifold is required. This may involve removing other engine components to access the manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dual-clutch transmission can experience clutch wear, especially with aggressive driving or frequent track use. Symptoms include slipping during gear changes, jerky engagement, and difficulty shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is necessary. This is a complex procedure that requires specialized tools and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mechatronic unit, which controls the transmission's shifting functions, can fail. This can cause a variety of shifting problems, including erratic gear changes, failure to shift, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the mechatronic unit is required. This may involve reprogramming the transmission control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Magneride Damper Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The magnetic ride (Magneride) dampers can sometimes develop leaks or malfunctions, leading to a decline in ride quality and handling. Warning lights on the dashboard may also appear.
    *   Solution: Damper replacement is required. The Magneride system may also need to be recalibrated after the replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (per pair)

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, particularly when the car is not driven regularly. This can lead to a dead battery and difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Investigate potential parasitic drains and ensure the battery is properly maintained. A battery tender may be helpful.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (for diagnostics and a new battery if needed)

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors can fail, leading to warning lights and potential performance issues. Common culprits include oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and wheel speed sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on the sensor)

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The coating on some interior plastic and rubber components can become sticky or gummy over time, particularly in hot climates. This affects the center console, door handles, and other trim pieces.
    *   Solution: The sticky coating can be professionally removed and reapplied.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the problem)

**Summary**

The 2017 Ferrari F12 Berlinetta, while a remarkable car, can present some notable issues. Engine oil leaks and exhaust manifold cracks can be expensive repairs. The dual-clutch transmission can suffer from clutch wear and mechatronic unit failures, also leading to substantial costs. Suspension issues with the Magneride system, electrical problems like battery drain and sensor failures, and the infamous "sticky interior" are also items to be mindful of. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the car's service history and be prepared for potentially high maintenance costs associated with these high-performance vehicles.
