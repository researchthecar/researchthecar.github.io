*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various areas of the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gaskets, and front crank seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the ground, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the location of the leak and labor involved).

Clutch wear is accelerated with poor driving habits such as frequent stop and go traffic. Symptoms of a worn clutch are transmission slippage under acceleration, difficulty engaging gears, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc and possibly the throw out bearing, pressure plate, and flywheel if there are any signs of damage.
