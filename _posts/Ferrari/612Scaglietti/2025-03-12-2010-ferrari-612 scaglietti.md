The 2010 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti is a grand tourer featuring a front-mounted engine and a luxurious interior. All 2010 Ferrari 612 Scagliettis are equipped with a 5.7L naturally aspirated V12 engine producing 532 horsepower and 434 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automated manual transmission known as F1A. Owners generally praise the car's powerful engine, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. However, potential downsides include high maintenance costs and the complexities associated with owning a high-performance exotic car.

**Engine**

**5.7L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets on the engine, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front/rear main seals. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots under the car, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ (depending on the location and complexity of the leak).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catalytic converters can fail due to age, overheating, or damage from impacts. Symptoms include a check engine light, reduced engine performance, and a sulfur smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (due to the cost of the parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed F1A Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear is a common issue with the F1A transmission due to the automated system's imperfect clutch engagement, particularly in stop-and-go traffic. Symptoms include slipping during acceleration, jerky shifting, and difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (including the clutch assembly, F1 sensor, and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **F1 Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 pump, responsible for hydraulic pressure in the automated manual transmission, can fail over time. Symptoms include failure to engage gears, transmission malfunction warnings, and a lack of hydraulic pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the F1 pump and potentially the hydraulic accumulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gear Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Symptoms include difficulty shifting, erratic gear selection, or the transmission getting stuck in a gear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failing position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electronically controlled dampers can develop leaks or fail, leading to a degraded ride quality and handling. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, uneven tire wear, and suspension warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (per corner, depending on the type of damper).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **ECU/TCU Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine Control Unit (ECU) and Transmission Control Unit (TCU) malfunctions can occur, leading to various engine and transmission issues. This can cause issues with fueling, ignition timing, shifting, and overall performance.
    *   Solution: Reprogramming or replacing the faulty ECU or TCU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failures of various sensors (e.g., mass airflow sensor, oxygen sensor, crankshaft position sensor) can trigger check engine lights and affect engine performance. Symptoms can include rough idling, poor acceleration, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the sensor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic headlight lenses can delaminate over time, causing them to become cloudy and reduce headlight output.
    *   Solution: Replacing or refinishing the headlight lenses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ (depending on whether the lenses are replaced or refinished).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Buttons**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue with many Ferraris from this era is "sticky buttons." The soft-touch coating on interior buttons and trim pieces can degrade over time, becoming sticky and unpleasant to the touch.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and re-coating or replacing the affected buttons and trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti offers a thrilling driving experience, but prospective buyers should be aware of potential issues and high maintenance costs. Engine oil leaks and catalytic converter issues can be costly to address. The F1A transmission is particularly prone to clutch wear and hydraulic pump failures, which can lead to significant repair bills. While the electronically controlled dampers enhance ride quality, their potential failure adds to the ownership costs. Electrical issues, such as sensor failures and ECU malfunctions, may require diagnosis and repair.
