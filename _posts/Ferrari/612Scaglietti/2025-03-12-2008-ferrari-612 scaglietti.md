    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Tighten or replace loose or damaged oil cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+, depending on the leak's location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Variator Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, check engine light, loss of power.
    * Solution: Replace the camshaft variators.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed F1 Automated Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 transmission's clutch can wear relatively quickly, especially with aggressive driving. Symptoms include slipping, jerky engagement, and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch. This often involves removing the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hydraulic Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F1 transmission relies on a hydraulic pump to actuate the gear changes. Pump failure can lead to shifting problems, including inability to shift or slow, jerky shifts. The pump can also be very noisy before failing.
    *   Solution: Replace the hydraulic pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission uses position sensors to determine gear selection. If these sensors fail, the transmission can experience difficulty selecting gears or may become stuck in gear.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty position sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on which sensor fails.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Electronic Damper Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 612 Scaglietti often came equipped with electronically controlled dampers. These can fail, leading to a harsh or bouncy ride, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty damper.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ per damper (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car can suffer from excessive battery drain, especially when left unattended for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Ensure the battery is in good condition. Investigate parasitic drains by testing each circuit. Consider using a battery tender when the car is not in use.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as ABS sensors, mass airflow sensors, and oxygen sensors, can fail. Symptoms vary depending on the failed sensor, but often include check engine lights, poor performance, and incorrect readings.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the sensor and its location.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation can build up inside the headlight housings, leading to reduced visibility and potential damage to the headlight components.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlight housing and dry it out. Reseal the housing to prevent future condensation. In severe cases, the headlight unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity and need for replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
