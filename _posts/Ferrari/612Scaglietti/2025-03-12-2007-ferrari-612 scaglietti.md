The 2007 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti is a grand tourer known for its elegant design, comfortable ride, and powerful performance. The Scaglietti featured a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and was powered by a 5.7-liter V12 engine producing 532 horsepower and 434 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed F1A automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the 612 for its luxurious interior, spacious cabin (for a Ferrari), and its ability to cover long distances in style and comfort. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, complex electronics that can be prone to issues, and the F1A transmission's sometimes jerky shifts at lower speeds.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, while a desirable grand tourer, can present owners with several potential issues. The most common problems relate to the engine (oil/coolant leaks, catalytic converters), the F1A transmission (clutch wear, hydraulic pump failure), and electrical gremlins. While less frequent, suspension issues and sticky interior trim can also arise. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with associated costs varying widely from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, making pre-purchase inspections by qualified Ferrari technicians a necessity.
