**Summary**

The 2009 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti is a desirable grand tourer, but potential buyers should be aware of potential maintenance costs. Engine issues like oil leaks and timing chain problems can be expensive to fix. The F1A transmission, while offering a unique driving experience, is prone to clutch wear and hydraulic issues. Electrical gremlins and sticky interior components can also add to the ownership experience. Overall, owning a 612 requires a commitment to regular maintenance and the willingness to address potential problems as they arise. While some issues are relatively minor, others can result in significant repair bills. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to assess the car's condition and identify potential problems before buying.
