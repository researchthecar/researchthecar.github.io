The 2023 Ferrari 812 GTS is a stunning grand tourer known for its breathtaking performance and open-top driving experience. Powered by a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine, it delivers a monstrous 789 horsepower and 530 lb-ft of torque. This power is transferred to the rear wheels through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally rave about the exhilarating engine note, rapid acceleration, and the overall sense of occasion that comes with driving a Ferrari. However, some criticisms include the relatively firm ride, limited cargo space, and the inherent high running costs associated with owning such a high-performance machine.

**Engine**

**6.5L V12**

*   **Engine Misfires/Check Engine Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine misfires or the check engine light illuminating, often accompanied by rough idling or decreased performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified Ferrari technician is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause, which could range from faulty ignition coils or spark plugs to more serious issues with the fuel injection system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the root cause).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of minor oil leaks, often originating from valve cover gaskets or around the oil pan, have surfaced. These leaks may manifest as drips on the garage floor or a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals with genuine Ferrari parts is the typical remedy. Proper torqueing of fasteners during reassembly is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+ (depending on the location and severity).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have mentioned experiencing occasional rough or jerky shifts, particularly at lower speeds or during aggressive driving. This may be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and relearn procedure might resolve the issue in some cases. More severe instances may require internal inspection and repair of the mechatronic unit or clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (fluid flush) - $8,000+ (major repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Adaptive Damper Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ferrari's adaptive suspension system (SCM-E) relies on electronically controlled dampers to adjust to road conditions. A failure of one or more dampers can result in a noticeably harsher ride, uneven handling, or a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty damper(s) is the most common solution. Calibration of the suspension system may be required afterward.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ (per damper, including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be prone to occasional glitches, such as screen freezes, unresponsive touch controls, or Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: A software update or a system reset might resolve minor glitches. More persistent issues may require replacement of the head unit or other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $5,000+ (head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (TPMS, Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors or parking sensors, may fail prematurely, triggering warning lights and affecting the functionality of the associated systems.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor is the standard remedy.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (per sensor, depending on type and location).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Retractable Hardtop Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While generally reliable, the retractable hardtop mechanism can experience issues such as slow operation, failure to fully open or close, or unusual noises. These problems may be caused by faulty hydraulics, sensors, or alignment issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a Ferrari technician is essential to determine the root cause. Repairs may involve lubricating the mechanism, replacing hydraulic components, or adjusting the alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $10,000+ (depending on the complexity of the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sticking Buttons/Controls**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that certain buttons or controls on the center console or steering wheel may become sticky or difficult to operate. This is often due to adhesive residue or debris accumulating over time.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the affected buttons with a suitable solvent or replacing the faulty control unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity and required parts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Ferrari 812 GTS, while a high-performance machine, can be susceptible to certain issues. Engine and transmission problems, such as misfires, oil leaks, and rough shifting, may require costly repairs. Electrical glitches and sensor failures can also be a nuisance. Suspension and retractable hardtop issues may further contribute to the overall ownership costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect any prospective purchase, preferably with the assistance of a qualified Ferrari technician. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue and the extent of damage.
