The 2004 Ferrari 456 M GTA is a grand tourer known for its elegant styling, powerful V12 engine, and comfortable ride. It represents a blend of performance and luxury that Ferrari aimed for during that era. The 456 M was offered with a 5.5L V12 engine that produces 436 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. This engine was available with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission (GTA). Owners often praise the car's refined driving experience, the V12 engine's sound and performance, and its timeless design. Criticisms typically focus on the high running costs, complex maintenance requirements, and potential for expensive repairs. The model is now over 20 years old, so these issues are likely to come up during ownership.

**Engine**

**5.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various points, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals. Thorough cleaning of the engine to identify the source of the leak is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the location and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from hoses, radiator, or water pump. Look for puddles of coolant, overheating, or low coolant levels.
    *   Solution: Replace leaky hoses, repair/replace the radiator, or replace the water pump and thermostat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A faulty camshaft position sensor can lead to rough idling, poor performance, or a no-start condition. A check engine light will typically illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (GTA)**

*   **Transmission Slippage/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can experience slippage between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, or a complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Often requires a complete transmission rebuild or replacement. Sometimes a valve body replacement can resolve minor issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can experience torque converter failure. This will prevent the engine from idling correctly, reduce the amount of power the engine can transfer to the transmission and wheels, and the vehicle will not drive smoothly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Self-Leveling Rear Suspension Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The self-leveling rear suspension, designed to maintain a consistent ride height, can develop issues. Symptoms include a sagging rear end, uneven ride height, or a noisy compressor.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the hydraulic components, ride height sensors, or compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ (depending on the affected component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the suspension bushings can wear out, leading to clunking noises, imprecise handling, and vibrations.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings with new ones.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of bushing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dashboard Warning Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various dashboard warning lights can illuminate due to sensor failures, wiring issues, or computer glitches.
    *   Solution: Requires diagnostic scanning to identify the root cause and then address the specific issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Electrical System Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drain can occur, especially if the car is not driven regularly. This can be due to a faulty component continuously drawing power.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Ferrari 456 M GTA is a desirable grand tourer, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine and transmission issues, particularly oil leaks, coolant leaks, and automatic transmission problems, can be costly to address. Suspension and electrical problems are also relatively common. Interior issues like sticky components, while not mechanically critical, can detract from the ownership experience. Overall, maintaining a 456 M GTA requires a proactive approach and a willingness to invest in preventative maintenance to avoid potentially expensive repairs. Severity of the issues is medium to high, and the cost is generally high, but can depend on the quality and frequency of maintenance performed.
