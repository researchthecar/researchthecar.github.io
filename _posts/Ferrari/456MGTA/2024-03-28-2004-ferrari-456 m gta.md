**Introduction**

The 2004 Ferrari 456 M GTA is a high-performance grand tourer produced by Ferrari. This two-door Italian exotic is powered by a naturally aspirated 5.5-liter V12 engine that produces 442 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. With a six-speed manual transmission, it can reach a top speed of 189 mph and accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. The 456 M GTA is known for its elegant design, luxurious interior, and exceptional performance. However, like many classic Ferraris, it has its share of potential issues.

**Engine**

**5.5-liter V12**

* **Intake manifold cracking:** Cracks in the intake manifold can cause vacuum leaks, leading to rough idling, poor engine performance, and reduced fuel economy. Replacement: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Valve guide wear:** Excessive wear on the valve guides can lead to oil leakage into the combustion chambers, causing blue smoke from the exhaust and increased oil consumption. Replacement: $4,000 - $6,000+

**Transmission**

**6-speed manual**

* **Clutch chatter:** Excessive chatter or juddering when engaging the clutch can indicate worn clutch plates or a failing pressure plate. Replacement: $2,000 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

* **Shock absorber failure:** Worn or damaged shock absorbers can result in a harsh ride, reduced handling, and excessive tire wear. Replacement: $1,000 - $1,500+ per axle
* **Sway bar link failure:** Broken or worn sway bar links can impede the vehicle's cornering ability and cause unusual noises when turning. Replacement: $500 - $1,000+ per axle

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** A failing alternator may not provide enough power to the electrical system, causing dimming lights, battery drain, or engine stalling. Replacement: $800 - $1,200+
* **Battery draining:** Electrical parasites or a weak battery can lead to premature battery discharge, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for an extended period. Solution: Battery replacement or parasitic drain diagnosis: $200 - $600+

**Summary**

The Ferrari 456 M GTA is a desirable and powerful classic car; however, it does come with some potential issues. The most common and significant problems are with the intake manifold, valve guides, and clutch.
