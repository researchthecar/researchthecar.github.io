**5.5L V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, often originating from valve cover gaskets, timing cover gaskets, and the front crankshaft seal. Can manifest as visible oil drips, burning oil smell, or low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals. Thorough cleaning of affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the source and extent of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catalytic converters are known to fail prematurely due to age and potential engine issues causing them to overheat. Symptoms include check engine lights, reduced performance, and failing emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converters. Addressing any underlying engine issues that may have caused the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ (due to parts cost and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cooling system can be prone to leaks and overheating. Weak points include the radiator, hoses, water pump, and thermostat. Overheating can lead to significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Pressure testing the system to identify leaks. Replacing damaged or worn components. Thorough flushing of the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Category: Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (GTA)**

*   **Transmission Slippage/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic (GTA) transmission can develop issues such as slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, and complete failure to engage gears. These issues are often related to worn clutches, valve body problems, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid and filter, rebuilding the valve body, or replacing the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6000+ (depending on the severity and the course of action)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**
*   No Issues Found

**Category: Suspension**

*   **Self-Leveling Rear Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear self-leveling suspension system (if equipped) can develop leaks in the hydraulic accumulators or struts, causing the rear of the car to sag or become bouncy. The pump itself can also fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing leaking accumulators, struts, or the hydraulic pump. Flushing and refilling the hydraulic system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $4000+ (depending on the parts needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Category: Electrical**

*   **ECU Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ECU (Engine Control Unit) can be prone to failure due to age and heat. Symptoms include intermittent stalling, difficulty starting, and various error codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the ECU with a specialized scanner. Repairing or replacing the ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $5000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement and coding)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Display Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard displays can suffer from pixel loss or complete failure, making it difficult to read vital information.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the dashboard display unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Category: Exterior**

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding/Yellowing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headlight lenses can become cloudy or yellowed over time, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Polishing the headlight lenses or replacing them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Category: Interior**

*   **Sticky Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Certain interior plastic and rubber components can become sticky and unpleasant to the touch due to the degradation of the original coating.
    *   Solution: Removing the sticky coating and refinishing the parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the number of parts and the complexity of the refinishing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2003 Ferrari 456 M GTA, while a beautiful and capable grand tourer, is subject to several age-related issues. Engine oil leaks, catalytic converter failures, and cooling system problems can be expensive to address. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic variant, can also be costly. Electrical problems, such as ECU failures and dashboard display issues, are also prevalent. Finally, sticky interior trim is an aesthetic annoyance. These issues are, for the most part, considered to be severe because many can lead to more expensive failures if ignored. The cost to fix can be relatively inexpensive for smaller repairs such as the headlight lenses or sticky trim, but can quickly become expensive for engine and transmission repairs. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified Ferrari mechanic to identify and address these potential issues.
