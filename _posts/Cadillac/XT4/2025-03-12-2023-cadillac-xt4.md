The 2023 Cadillac XT4 is a compact luxury SUV offering a blend of style, technology, and practicality. It comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, producing 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Known for its comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and spacious interior for its class, the XT4 is often praised for its value proposition. However, some common criticisms include its somewhat uninspired engine performance compared to rivals and occasionally less-than-premium interior material quality.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged I4 (LSY)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, the need to add oil frequently, and in some cases, bluish smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the engine control module (ECM) might help to optimize fuel injection and combustion, potentially reducing oil consumption. If the consumption is severe, it could point to piston ring issues, requiring engine disassembly and repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update), $3,000 - $8,000+ (engine repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported turbocharger failures resulting in loss of power, unusual noises (whining, whistling), and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to turbocharger performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (9T45)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation or delay when accelerating, especially from a stop or during passing maneuvers. Some have noticed this more in cold weather.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may resolve shifting issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250 (software update), $800 - $1,500 (valve body replacement), $3,000 - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Cadillac User Experience (CUE) infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other functions.
    *   Solution: A software update for the CUE system might address stability issues. In some cases, a system reset or replacement of the infotainment control module is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update if under warranty), $500 - $1,500+ (control module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera. The screen may display a blank image, distorted view, or error message when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera wiring harness for damage or loose connections. If the wiring is intact, the camera unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises, difficulty opening or closing, or water leaks around the sunroof/moonroof.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the sunroof mechanism, including lubrication, adjustment, or replacement of faulty components. Resealing the sunroof to address leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Cadillac XT4 has some reported issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant relate to the engine (excessive oil consumption and turbocharger issues), transmission (harsh shifting), and electrical system (infotainment glitches). While some issues can be resolved with software updates, others may require more costly repairs, such as turbocharger or transmission replacement. These issues range from moderate inconvenience to potentially serious mechanical problems. Given the nature of these issues, it's advisable to thoroughly inspect a used 2023 Cadillac XT4 and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic, especially focusing on the engine and transmission performance.
