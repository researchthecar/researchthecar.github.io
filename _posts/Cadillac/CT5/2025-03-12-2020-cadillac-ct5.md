The 2020 Cadillac CT5 is a luxury sedan offering a blend of style, performance, and technology. It's available with three engine options: a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 producing 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6 producing 335 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque (in the Premium Luxury trim) or 360 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque (in the V-Series trim).
