The 2024 Cadillac CT5 is a luxury sedan that aims to blend performance with comfort and style. It's generally praised for its sharp handling, comfortable ride, and stylish interior, though some find the rear seat space a bit tight.

It offers several engine options, including a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 engine producing 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6 making 335 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque, and a high-performance 3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6 that produces 360 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque in the CT5-V and a 6.2L Supercharged V8 making 690 horsepower and 630 lb-ft of torque in the CT5-V Blackwing. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.
