The 2023 Cadillac CT5 is a luxury sedan that aims to blend performance and comfort. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 (237 hp, 258 lb-ft torque), a 3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6 (335 hp, 405 lb-ft torque), and a high-performance 3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6 (360 hp, 405 lb-ft torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CT5 for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. However, some common complaints include the relatively small rear seat space for a sedan in its class, and concerns about long-term reliability.
