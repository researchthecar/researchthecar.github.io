Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2021 Cadillac CT5, organized as requested.

The 2021 Cadillac CT5 is a compact luxury sedan that aims to blend style, performance, and technology. Engine choices include a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 (237 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6 (335 hp, 405 lb-ft of torque or 360 hp, 405 lb-ft of torque in the V-Series), and a 6.2L Supercharged V8 in the CT5-V Blackwing (668 hp, 659 lb-ft of torque). A 10-speed automatic transmission is standard across the range, except for the CT5-V Blackwing which offers a 6-speed manual as an option. Owners often praise the CT5 for its sharp styling, comfortable ride (especially with Magnetic Ride Control, available on some trims), and user-friendly infotainment system. Common criticisms include a somewhat cramped rear seat, some lower-quality interior materials compared to rivals, and a less engaging driving experience compared to some sportier competitors, except for the CT5-V and CT5-V Blackwing models.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can be indicated by the low oil pressure light activating, or the oil level warning appearing on the infotainment system.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacement of valve stem seals or piston rings may be necessary. A cylinder leak-down test can diagnose the source of the oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature turbocharger failure on some vehicles. Symptoms include a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining, screeching), and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement is the common fix. It's crucial to diagnose the root cause of the failure (e.g., oil starvation, debris ingestion) to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L Supercharged V8**
*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines Except CT5-V Blackwing manual)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop or during passing maneuvers has also been noted.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) re-flash or software update is sometimes effective. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update, $800 - $2,000+ for valve body, $3,000 - $7,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the torque converter can manifest as shuddering or vibration at certain speeds, particularly during light acceleration or cruising.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement is typically required. Flushing the transmission fluid may provide temporary relief but is not a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission (CT5-V Blackwing only)**
*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (if equipped) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the Magnetic Ride Control shocks, leading to a loss of damping and a harsher ride. Error messages related to the suspension system may appear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected Magnetic Ride Control shock(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per shock, depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Infotainment screen freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and unexpected system reboots.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, replacement of the infotainment module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) to $800 - $1,500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing parasitic draws on the electrical system. Common culprits include faulty modules or accessories that are not shutting down properly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with drilling small drain holes in the housings. More permanent solutions involve resealing the headlight assembly or replacing the entire unit.

**Summary**

The 2021 Cadillac CT5 presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. Engine issues, particularly with the 2.0L and 3.0L turbocharged engines, can be expensive to repair. Transmission problems, though sometimes addressable with software updates, can also lead to costly repairs or replacements. Electrical glitches are common, but not always severe. Suspension issues with Magnetic Ride Control, if equipped, can also lead to hefty bills. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider a thorough pre-purchase inspection, especially focusing on engine health, transmission performance, and the functionality of the infotainment system. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific problem.
