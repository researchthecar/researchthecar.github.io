The 2021 Cadillac CT4 is a compact luxury sedan offering a blend of style, performance, and technology. It competes with vehicles like the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 producing 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L Turbocharged I4 producing 310 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque (in Premium Luxury trim), and a high-output version of the 2.7L Turbocharged I4 producing 325 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque (in CT4-V trim). A 3.6L twin-turbo V6 producing 472 horsepower and 445 lb-ft of torque is also available in the CT4-V Blackwing trim, however it is available with a manual transmission so it is not included. The 2.0L engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.7L engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the CT4's sharp handling, comfortable ride, and stylish interior. Common dislikes include the somewhat cramped rear seating and the complexity of the infotainment system for some users.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between service intervals. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Dealers may perform an oil consumption test to assess the severity. Potential fixes range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings or, in severe cases, replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7,000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L Turbocharged I4 (310 hp & 325 hp)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature turbocharger failure has been reported by some owners. Symptoms include a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling) from the engine bay, and potential check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement is the typical solution. Also, inspect and potentially replace the oil feed line to the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.0L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifts, particularly when shifting between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or a brief hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (for software reflash) - $5,000+ (for transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic (Paired with 2.7L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 8-speed, some owners have reported harsh or delayed shifts, particularly when shifting between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or a brief hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (for software reflash) - $5,000+ (for transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported occasional glitches with the infotainment system, including screen freezes, slow response times, and Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Try to perform a system reset, or have the dealer perform a software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software reflash) - $200+ (if parts are damaged)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced excessive battery drain, especially when the vehicle is left parked for extended periods. This can result in a dead battery and the need for a jump start.
    *   Solution: The dealer needs to perform a parasitic draw test to determine the source of the drain. Potential causes include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for battery replacement) - $500+ (depending on the cause of the parasitic draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Cadillac CT4, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, has experienced some common issues. The most notable issues revolve around the 2.0L and 2.7L engines and 8-speed & 10-speed transmissions, with potential oil consumption issues, and turbocharger failures requiring potentially costly repairs. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and battery drain also present challenges. While some issues can be resolved with software updates, others may require significant component replacements, potentially resulting in high repair costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, and should be prepared to conduct thorough inspections and maintenance.
