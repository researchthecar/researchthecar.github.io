The 2020 Cadillac CT4 is a compact luxury sedan offering a blend of sporty handling and Cadillac refinement. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 producing 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L Dual Volute Turbocharged I4 producing 309 horsepower and 348 lb-ft of torque (CT4-V) or 325 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque (Premium Luxury), and a 3.6L V6 producing 472 horsepower and 445 lb-ft of torque (CT4-V Blackwing). All engines (excluding the CT4-V Blackwing) are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (3-speed automatic transmission for CT4-V Blackwing), or a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the CT4's sharp styling, comfortable ride, and advanced technology features. Criticisms often include a cramped rear seat and interior materials that don't quite match the luxury price point.

**Summary**

The 2020 Cadillac CT4 has a range of potential issues, varying in severity and cost. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption on the 2.7L Turbo I4 can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting, appear across both 8-speed and 10-speed automatics, potentially requiring costly repairs if recalibration doesn't resolve the problem. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system are common and can be frustrating. While the CT4 offers a stylish design and enjoyable driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problem areas.
