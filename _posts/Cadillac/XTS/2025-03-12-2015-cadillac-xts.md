The 2015 Cadillac XTS is a full-size luxury sedan offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was available with a few engine options: a standard 3.6L V6 producing 304 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque, and an optional 3.6L Twin-Turbo V6 generating 410 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the XTS for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample rear passenger space. Common complaints revolve around the somewhat dated infotainment system and less-than-sporty handling compared to some rivals.

**Summary**

The 2015 Cadillac XTS can experience a range of issues, with some being more costly and severe than others. Engine-related problems like timing chain failures and turbocharger issues (on the Twin-Turbo models) can be expensive to address. The CUE infotainment system is a common point of complaint, and MRC suspension problems can also lead to high repair bills. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and carefully inspect any prospective XTS, paying close attention to its service history.
