The 2016 Cadillac XTS is a full-size luxury sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and attractive price point compared to some of its European competitors. Available engines include a 3.6L V6 producing 304 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Twin Turbo V6 producing 410 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the XTS for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample rear legroom. However, some criticisms include the somewhat dated infotainment system, less engaging driving dynamics compared to sportier sedans, and some concerns regarding reliability.
