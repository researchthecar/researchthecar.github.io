### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Cadillac XTS demonstrates a mixed reliability profile. The powertrain, particularly the 3.6L V6 engine, can experience issues like coolant leaks and timing chain problems, while the turbocharged 4-cylinder may face turbocharger concerns. The automatic transmission is prone to harsh shifting and potential control module failures. The advanced Magnetic Ride Control suspension, while offering a superior ride, can be a source of costly sensor and strut repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially with the CUE infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. However, the exterior and interior components generally hold up well. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and budget for possible repairs, especially as the vehicle ages.
