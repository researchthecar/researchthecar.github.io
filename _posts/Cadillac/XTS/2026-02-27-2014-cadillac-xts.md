### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Cadillac XTS demonstrates a generally good reliability record, with most reported issues concentrated in specific areas rather than being widespread across the model. Powertrain components, particularly the engines and transmissions, are the most frequent sources of concern, with coolant leaks, timing chain issues, and transmission shifting problems being notable. The advanced Magnetic Ride Control suspension can also present issues with sensor failures. Electrical gremlins, especially with the CUE infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also points to consider. However, the exterior and interior generally hold up well, with few systemic problems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can mitigate many potential repair costs.
