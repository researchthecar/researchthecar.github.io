The 2018 Cadillac XTS is a full-size luxury sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and elegant styling. The XTS offered a choice of two engine options: a 3.6L naturally aspirated V6 producing 304 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L twin-turbocharged V6 producing 410 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the XTS for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample rear legroom. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated infotainment system and handling that doesn't quite match the sporty aspirations of some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.6L Naturally Aspirated V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, bluish exhaust smoke, and the need to add oil regularly (e.g., every 1,000 miles or less).
    *   Solution: In some cases, the PCV valve is defective and causing the oil consumption. Replacement of the PCV valve can fix the issue. For more serious cases, engine components such as piston rings may be the cause. Repair may involve replacing the piston rings or replacing the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (PCV valve), $3,000 - $7,000+ (piston rings or engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain in some 3.6L V6 engines can stretch or wear prematurely. This can cause a check engine light, rough running, and decreased performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbochargers on the twin-turbo V6 can fail prematurely. Symptoms include a loss of power, whistling or grinding noises from the engine, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ per turbocharger
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or harsh shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Others have experienced delayed engagement when shifting from park to drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Fluid change can sometimes resolve this, however, this is often an issue with the valve body in the transmission. The valve body can be replaced or the transmission can be rebuilt/replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (fluid change), $800 - $2,000+ (valve body replacement), $3,000 - $6,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) system, standard on some XTS models, can experience issues such as sensor failures, strut leaks, or damping problems. Symptoms include a harsh or bouncy ride, clunking noises from the suspension, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty MRC components, such as struts, sensors, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per strut, plus labor for sensor or module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **CUE Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Cadillac User Experience (CUE) infotainment system can experience issues such as screen delamination, slow response times, software glitches, and failure to connect to Bluetooth devices. The capacitive touch buttons can also become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CUE screen, software updates, or replacement of the entire CUE unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (screen replacement), $1,500 - $2,500+ (CUE unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, leading to a dead battery, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw, which may involve testing individual circuits and components. Common causes include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (diagnosis), plus the cost of replacing the faulty component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation. This can reduce headlight brightness and potentially damage the headlight assembly.
    * Solution: Replacing the headlight housing and sealing it properly to prevent further moisture intrusion.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per headlight.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported sunroof issues such as failure to open or close, sticking, and excessive wind noise when closed.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the sunroof tracks and seals, repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, or replacement of the entire sunroof assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (lubrication/minor repair), $500 - $2,000+ (motor/assembly replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Cadillac XTS has some notable issues, primarily concerning the engine, transmission, electrical system, and sunroof. Oil consumption and timing chain issues on the 3.6L V6, along with potential turbocharger failures on the twin-turbo variant, are the most serious engine concerns. Transmission problems include rough shifting and delayed engagement. Electrical issues are common with the CUE infotainment system. Suspension concerns relate to the Magnetic Ride Control. While some issues may be relatively inexpensive to address, others, like engine repairs or complete transmission replacements, can be quite costly.
