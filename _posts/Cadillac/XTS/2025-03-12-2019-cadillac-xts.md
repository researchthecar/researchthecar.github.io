Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Cadillac XTS, organized by category and engine/transmission option where applicable.

The 2019 Cadillac XTS is a full-size luxury sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. It offers two engine options: a 3.6L V6 producing 304 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Twin Turbo V6 producing 410 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque (available on the V-Sport). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the XTS's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and generous rear-seat legroom. Some criticisms include the somewhat dated design (as it was the final year of production) and the lack of handling prowess compared to some European rivals.
