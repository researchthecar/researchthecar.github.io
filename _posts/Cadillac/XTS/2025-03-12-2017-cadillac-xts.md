Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 Cadillac XTS, categorized by component and specific to engine/transmission options where applicable.

The 2017 Cadillac XTS is a full-size luxury sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and elegant styling. Engine options include a 3.6L V6 (304 hp, 264 lb-ft torque) and a 3.6L Twin-Turbo V6 (410 hp, 369 lb-ft torque). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
