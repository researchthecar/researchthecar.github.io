**Introduction:**
The 2021 Cadillac XT5 is a midsize luxury SUV known for its spacious cabin, advanced technology, and comfortable ride. It is available with a choice of two engine and two transmission options: a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.6L V6 engine with 310 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Praised for its sharp handling and responsive steering, the XT5 is criticized for its cramped third row and lackluster fuel economy.
