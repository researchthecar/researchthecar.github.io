The 2020 Cadillac XT5 is a luxury crossover SUV offering a blend of style, comfort, and technology. It came with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 generating 310 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the XT5 for its quiet and comfortable ride, upscale interior, and user-friendly technology. Common complaints often revolve around the relatively uninspired driving dynamics compared to some rivals, and some perceived shortcomings in material quality for the price point.
