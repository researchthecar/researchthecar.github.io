The 2024 Cadillac XT5 is a luxury crossover SUV offering a blend of comfort, style, and technology. It is available with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the XT5 for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common criticisms include the somewhat uninspiring base engine performance, the higher price point compared to competitors, and the smaller cargo area than some rivals.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This may present as a low oil light illuminated on the dashboard or noticing a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: In some cases, a faulty PCV valve can cause this issue and replacing it may resolve the problem. If the consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test might be needed to determine if there is internal engine damage. This might require piston ring replacement or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (PCV Valve). $2,000 - $5,000+ (Engine Repair/Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed driving or when shifting between gears. Others have reported hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop.
    * Solution: A software update or transmission control module (TCM) re-calibration might address the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be required.
