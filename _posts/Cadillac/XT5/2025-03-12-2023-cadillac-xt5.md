The 2023 Cadillac XT5 is a luxury compact SUV that offers a blend of comfort, style, and technology. It comes with two engine options: a 2.0L Turbocharged 4-cylinder engine producing 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the XT5's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired driving dynamics and the lack of a hybrid or electric powertrain option.
