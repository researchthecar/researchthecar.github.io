**Introduction to the 1993 Cadillac Eldorado**

The 1993 Cadillac Eldorado was the final year for the eighth-generation of the iconic luxury coupe. It came equipped with a standard 4.9-liter V8 engine producing 200 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 4.6-liter Northstar V8 generating 275 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque was available as an option. Both engines were paired with a standard 4-speed automatic transmission.
