### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Cadillac Eldorado, while offering a luxurious experience, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of vehicles from its era. The Northstar V8 engines, particularly the 4.6L variants, are prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and, in some cases, more serious head gasket failures and oil leaks. The 4T80-E transmission can experience issues with the torque converter and solenoids. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or alternator, are also reported. Exterior paint degradation and interior dashboard cracking are cosmetic issues to be aware of. Despite these potential problems, many Eldorados have been well-maintained and can still provide a comfortable and stylish ride if these common issues are addressed.
