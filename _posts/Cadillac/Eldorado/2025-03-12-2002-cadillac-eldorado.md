The 2002 Cadillac Eldorado, the final year of this iconic model, is a full-size luxury coupe that attracts enthusiasts with its distinctive styling and comfortable ride. While appreciated for its smooth driving experience and spacious interior, especially for a coupe, common complaints center around aging components and the cost of repairs. The Eldorado was available with two engine options, both variations of the Northstar V8: the 4.6L LD8 producing 275 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, and the 4.6L L37 producing 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the 4T80-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners find the styling and spaciousness appealing, but concerns arise due to age-related issues and the relative complexity of the vehicle.
