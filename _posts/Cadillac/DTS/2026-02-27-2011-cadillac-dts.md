### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Cadillac DTS is a comfortable and capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 4.6L V8 engine can experience coolant and oil leaks, often related to gasket failures. The 4-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can develop slipping issues or torque converter problems. Suspension components, particularly the air suspension system and standard bushings, are also areas to inspect. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or infotainment system, can be frustrating. Interior climate control blend door actuators are a known failure point. Despite these potential issues, many DTS models have proven reliable with proper maintenance.
