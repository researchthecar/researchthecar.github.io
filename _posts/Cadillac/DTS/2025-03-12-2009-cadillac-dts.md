The 2009 Cadillac DTS is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It came standard with a 4.6L Northstar V8 engine producing 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque in standard tune, or 292 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque in Performance trim models. The only transmission option was a 4-speed automatic (4T80E). Many owners appreciate the car's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and traditional Cadillac styling. Common complaints include its somewhat dated technology, lower fuel economy compared to newer vehicles, and certain reliability issues related to its age.

**Engine**

**4.6L Northstar V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. This can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter damage, and eventually engine damage if left unaddressed. Blue smoke from the exhaust upon startup or acceleration is a telltale sign.
    *   Solution: The fix for excessive oil consumption can vary. In some cases, switching to a different oil viscosity or using a high-mileage oil can help. More severe cases may require replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or even a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and required repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Northstar V8 is known for developing coolant leaks, particularly from the head gasket and water pump areas. Overheating, low coolant levels, and coolant smells are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacing the head gaskets or water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ for head gaskets, $500 - $1000+ for the water pump.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4T80E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. This can be caused by worn valve body components, solenoid failures, or low transmission fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission service (fluid and filter change) may resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on the severity and required repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DTS offered an optional air suspension system. Compressor failure leads to the rear of the car sagging, a "service ride control" message on the dashboard, and a rough ride. The compressor may also run constantly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor. It is also advised to inspect and potentially replace air struts/shocks and air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ for compressor replacement, $600 - $1500+ per strut/shock replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Electronic Dampening Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electronic dampening system can fail, leading to a poor ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the electronic dampeners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ per strut.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the battery draining overnight or within a few days of non-use. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Identifying and isolating the source of the parasitic draw using a multimeter. Replacing the faulty module or accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver Information Center (DIC) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DIC may display inaccurate information, flicker, or fail completely. This can be caused by a faulty display screen or a problem with the DIC module.
    *   Solution: Replacing the DIC display screen or module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, leading to reduced visibility and potential damage to the headlight bulbs and electrical components.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlights, drying them out, and resealing the housings. Replacing damaged bulbs or components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can malfunction, failing to open or close properly, or becoming stuck in one position. This can be caused by a faulty motor, damaged tracks, or broken cables.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sunroof motor, repairing or replacing the tracks, or replacing the cables.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the specific issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Cadillac DTS, while comfortable and luxurious, has some common issues to be aware of.
