The 2007 Cadillac DTS, a full-size luxury sedan, offers a comfortable ride and spacious interior, which are commonly cited as positives. Drivers appreciate the smooth suspension and ample legroom, especially in the rear. However, some common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system and suspension components, as well as the relatively dated technology compared to newer vehicles. The 2007 DTS came standard with a 4.6L Northstar V8 engine, producing 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque in the Luxury I and Luxury II trims, and 292 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque in the Luxury III, Performance, and Premium trims. It was paired exclusively with a 4T80-E four-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.6L Northstar V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from the valve cover gaskets or the oil pan gasket. This can result in oil spots on the driveway and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected gaskets. Thoroughly clean the area around the leak before installing the new gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, often from the water pump, radiator, or hoses. Overheating can occur if the coolant level drops too low.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component (water pump, radiator, or hose). Perform a pressure test to locate all leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and milky oil. A less common but serious issue with the Northstar engine.
    *   Solution: Head gasket replacement (a complex and expensive repair). In some cases, engine replacement may be more cost-effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4T80-E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or when downshifting.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor issues. If the problem persists, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Typically requires a transmission rebuild or replacement. Could be caused by worn clutch packs or a failing torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the car sags, and the "Service Ride Control" message appears on the dashboard. The air suspension compressor fails to inflate the rear air springs.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Spring Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the car sags, especially overnight. The air springs develop leaks, causing them to deflate.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air springs. It's recommended to replace both air springs simultaneously.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Shocks Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. The MRC shocks (if equipped) lose their ability to dampen effectively. The "Service Ride Control" light may illuminate.

**Summary**

The 2007 Cadillac DTS presents several potential issues for prospective buyers. While engine and transmission problems can be costly, suspension and electrical issues are more common. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousands, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection crucial. Although reliable when well-maintained, the DTS's age means many components are nearing the end of their service life, potentially leading to unexpected repairs.
