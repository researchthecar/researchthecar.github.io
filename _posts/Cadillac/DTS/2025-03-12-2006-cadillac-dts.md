The 2006 Cadillac DTS is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was offered with a single engine option: the 4.6L Northstar V8, producing 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque in the Luxury I and II trims and 291 horsepower and 292 lb-ft of torque in the Performance model.

**Summary**

The 2006 Cadillac DTS, while a comfortable and luxurious vehicle for its time, suffers from several common issues typical of aging luxury cars. The Northstar V8 engine is prone to coolant and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. The 4-speed transmission, while generally reliable, can exhibit harsh shifting and slipping. Electrical issues are also fairly common. The severity and cost of these issues range from relatively minor repairs to major overhauls, with some engine and transmission repairs potentially costing several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
