The 2010 Cadillac DTS is a full-size luxury sedan that was available with only one engine option: the 4.6L Northstar V8, producing 275 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque in standard guise and 292 hp and 288 lb-ft of torque in Performance models. This engine was paired with a 4T80E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the DTS for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and traditional Cadillac styling. Common complaints include relatively low fuel economy for its class and some outdated technology compared to its competitors.

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can occur, requiring frequent top-offs. This can lead to spark plug fouling and catalytic converter damage if left unaddressed. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating frequently, visible blue smoke from the exhaust, and a noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Potential solutions range from replacing the valve stem seals, piston rings, or even a complete engine rebuild, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Northstar engine is prone to coolant leaks, particularly from the head gaskets, water pump, and coolant crossover manifold. These leaks can lead to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include a sweet smell from the engine bay, low coolant levels, and the engine temperature gauge running high.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking components, such as head gaskets, water pump, or coolant crossover manifold. In severe cases, the engine block or cylinder heads may need to be resurfaced or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Individual ignition coils can fail, leading to misfires, rough running, and a loss of power. The check engine light will illuminate, and a diagnostic scan will reveal the faulty coil(s).
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s).
