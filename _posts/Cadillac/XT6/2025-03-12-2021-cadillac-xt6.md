Alright, here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Cadillac XT6, formatted as requested.

The 2021 Cadillac XT6 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV, known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. It offers two engine options: a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 producing 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 310 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque.
