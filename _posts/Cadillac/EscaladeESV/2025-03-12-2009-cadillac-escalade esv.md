The 2009 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a large luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and upscale features. It's often praised for its comfortable ride and towing capacity, but some common complaints include its poor fuel economy, large size making it difficult to maneuver, and some reliability issues. The 2009 Escalade ESV was only offered with one engine and transmission option: a 6.2L V8 engine producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6L80E 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system is designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders under light load. However, the lifters associated with this system are prone to failure, leading to misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. The check engine light may illuminate with codes related to cylinder misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and often the camshaft. Some owners opt to disable the AFM system altogether during the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often linked to the AFM system and piston ring design. Owners may notice the need to add oil frequently between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust can also be a symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings, which is a labor-intensive job. As with AFM lifter failure, some owners choose to disable AFM during this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knock Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine knocking, reduced performance, and a check engine light. Diagnostic codes will indicate a knock sensor issue. The sensors are located under the intake manifold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty knock sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80E 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrating during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Can also manifest as harsh or erratic shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may shift hard, slip between gears, or fail to shift at all. This can be caused by valve body issues, worn clutches, or low fluid level.
    *   Solution: A transmission rebuild or replacement is often necessary. Sometimes, a valve body replacement can resolve the issue, but this is less common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle may sag, especially overnight. The air suspension compressor may run constantly or fail to operate at all. "Service Ride Control" message may appear on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Air Spring Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to compressor failure, the rear of the vehicle sags. You may hear hissing sounds from the air springs (air bags).
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per air spring
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Autoride Shock Absorber Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, and a "Service Ride Control" message. The shocks are electronically controlled and can leak or fail internally.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Autoride shock absorbers. These are more expensive than standard shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Radio Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation/radio screen may become unresponsive, blank, or display distorted images.
    *   Solution: Replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (depending on whether a new or refurbished unit is used)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door locks may fail to lock or unlock properly, either intermittently or completely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate will not stay open or close properly. It may sag or drop quickly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Heated/Cooled Seat Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heated or cooled seats may fail to work or may only work intermittently. This can be due to a faulty heating element, blower motor, or control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Cadillac Escalade ESV, while luxurious and powerful, has several potential issues. Engine problems, particularly related to the AFM system, and transmission concerns can be costly to repair. The suspension system, if equipped with air suspension or Autoride, can also present expensive maintenance items. Electrical issues, like screen and door lock failures, are less severe but still inconvenient. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor repair costs into their purchase decision. Addressing the AFM lifter issue preemptively can save on major repairs down the line.
