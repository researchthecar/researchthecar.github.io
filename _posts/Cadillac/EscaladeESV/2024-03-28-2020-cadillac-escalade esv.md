**Introduction:**
The 2020 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a full-size SUV that combines luxury and capability. It is powered by a 6.2L V8 engine producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Escalade ESV is praised for its spacious cabin, advanced technology, and comfortable ride. However, like any vehicle, it has experienced specific issues.
