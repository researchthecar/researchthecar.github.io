The 2015 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a full-size luxury SUV that offers a spacious interior, powerful engine, and a host of upscale features. It was praised for its comfortable ride, luxurious cabin, and strong towing capacity. However, some common complaints included a sometimes-clunky transmission, a complex infotainment system, and a relatively high price tag. The 2015 Escalade ESV was available with a single engine option: a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8, producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a single transmission option: the 8L90 eight-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can experience lifter failures. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light. This issue can lead to significant engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters is necessary. Many owners choose to replace all the lifters and often replace the camshaft at the same time to prevent future issues. Some choose to disable the AFM system altogether to prevent the problem from recurring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-ups between services. The issue is often attributed to the PCV system, valve seals, or piston rings.
    *   Solution: A PCV valve replacement, valve seal replacement, or piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: PCV Valve Replacement $100-$200+, Valve Seal Replacement $1,500-$3,000+, Piston Ring Replacement $4,000-$6,000+

**Transmission**

**8L90 Eight-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8L90 transmission has been known to exhibit harsh or erratic shifting, particularly when shifting between lower gears. Some drivers report a noticeable "clunk" or "shudder" during shifts. Hesitation upon acceleration is also a common complaint.
    *   Solution: A software re-flash can correct some of the issues. In other cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement might be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software re-flash $100 - $300, Valve body replacement $800 - $1,500+, Transmission replacement $4,000 - $7,000+

    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed MRC shocks is necessary. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) to maintain consistent damping characteristics.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Escalades with the optional air suspension can experience compressor failures, leading to ride height issues. Common symptoms include the rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal, the compressor running constantly, or a suspension warning light.

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing unexplained battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits unused for extended periods. This can lead to starting problems or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the drain is necessary, often involving parasitic draw testing. Possible causes include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the source, $100 - $500+
