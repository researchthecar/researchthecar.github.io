The 2019 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a large luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and upscale features. It's a vehicle that appeals to buyers looking for a comfortable and commanding ride with ample room for passengers and cargo. The 2019 Escalade ESV is powered by a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 engine producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its luxurious interior, smooth ride (especially with Magnetic Ride Control), and strong towing capability. Common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, relatively poor fuel economy, and the infotainment system can be somewhat cumbersome to use.

**Engine**

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifter failure in the AFM system is a common problem. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption is a known issue on some 6.2L V8 engines. Owners may notice needing to add oil more frequently than expected. In some cases, this can be caused by the AFM system or faulty valve seals.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the root cause is essential. Solutions range from replacing valve seals to addressing AFM-related issues. In severe cases, engine replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7,000+ (depending on the cause and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10L80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or "jerk" during gear changes or hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: A software update or reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (reflash) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Magnetic Ride Control suspension can experience sensor failures, strut leaks, or complete system malfunction. Symptoms include a rough or bouncy ride, uneven handling, and error messages related to the suspension system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty components, such as sensors, struts, or the Magnetic Ride Control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per strut (depending on the extent of damage and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, unresponsive touchscreen, and intermittent system resets.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the infotainment module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, requiring frequent jump starts or battery replacements. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve replacing a faulty module or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may get stuck. This can be caused by a faulty motor, sensor, or latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heating/Cooling Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front seats may not heat or cool properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the heating/cooling element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Cadillac Escalade ESV, while luxurious and powerful, has several common issues to be aware of. Engine problems like AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption can be costly to repair. The 10-speed transmission may exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins like infotainment glitches and battery drain can also be frustrating. The Magnetic Ride Control suspension, though contributing to a comfortable ride when functioning properly, can be prone to failure. While some issues are minor and can be resolved with software updates, others can lead to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
