The 2020 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a full-size luxury SUV offering a spacious cabin, powerful engine options, and a plethora of features. It was available with two engine choices: a 6.2L V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duramax turbo-diesel inline-6 which creates 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission for both engines is a 10-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Escalade ESV for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and ample cargo space, while common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver, and its relatively high price tag.
