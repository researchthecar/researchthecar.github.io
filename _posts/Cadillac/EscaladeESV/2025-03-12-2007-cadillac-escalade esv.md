The 2007 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and upscale features. It appeals to buyers looking for a comfortable and capable vehicle with a bold design. However, some common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, its poor fuel economy, and some reliability issues. The 2007 Escalade ESV came with two engine options: a 6.2L V8 producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, possible solutions include replacing valve seals or piston rings. Some owners have also reported success with using a thicker viscosity oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise coming from the engine, rough idling, misfires, and reduced power. Caused by failure of the AFM lifters.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed AFM lifters. Some owners choose to replace all lifters and disable the AFM system to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt during light acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This is typically caused by wear or damage to the torque converter clutch.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter or perform a complete transmission rebuild. A fluid flush may temporarily alleviate the issue in mild cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears. This can be caused by valve body issues or internal wear within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or transmission rebuild. A fluid and filter change might help in some cases but is unlikely to be a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, especially after sitting overnight. The air suspension compressor may be loud or not function at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. Also inspect the air struts for leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

*   **Air Strut Leaks (If equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar symptoms to compressor failure, the rear of the vehicle sagging. Hissing sound may be heard near the struts.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per pair

*   **Autoride Shock Absorber Failure (If equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bounciness, poor ride quality, and reduced handling performance. The Autoride system warning light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the Autoride shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,500+ per pair

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery draining overnight or within a few days of sitting.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty door lock actuators, the radio, and the OnStar module. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the source.

*   **Navigation/Radio Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation or radio screen failing to turn on, flickering, or displaying incorrect information.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks not working properly, either failing to lock or unlock.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
