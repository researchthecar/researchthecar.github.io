The 2024 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spaciousness, advanced technology, and powerful engine options. It's often praised for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and impressive towing capacity. However, some owners have reported issues affecting overall reliability. Engine options include a 6.2L V8 (420 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo Diesel (277 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Some common dislikes include the vehicle's large size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces, and its high price tag.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illuminated, potential for significant engine damage if not addressed. AFM/DFM systems are designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, but the lifters can fail, causing these symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters, potentially requiring removal of the cylinder head. In severe cases, camshaft replacement may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Could vary from monitoring oil levels and topping off, to more involved solutions such as PCV valve replacement, or in severe cases, piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, reduced power, excessive smoke (white or black) from the exhaust, potential for fuel dilution in the engine oil.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the faulty injector(s), followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine performance, rough idle, and potential stalling. The EGR valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits, leading to these issues.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, noticeable slipping during acceleration, hesitation when shifting.
    *   Solution: Software update or transmission replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, poor fuel economy, and transmission overheating. The torque converter is responsible for transferring power from the engine to the transmission, and issues can manifest in these symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Ride Suspension Malfunctions (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, rough ride, air compressor failing to activate, "Service Ride Control" message on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the system to identify the faulty component (air struts, compressor, height sensors, or control module). Replacement of the defective part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ per corner (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, audio issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealership, reset of the system, or in severe cases, replacement of the infotainment module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when the car is parked for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify parasitic drain.
