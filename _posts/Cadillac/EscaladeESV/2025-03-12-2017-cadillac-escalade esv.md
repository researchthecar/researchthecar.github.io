The 2017 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spaciousness, powerful engine, and upscale features. It was offered with a single engine option: a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 engine producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (8L90). Owners generally appreciate the Escalade ESV's luxurious interior, comfortable ride, and ample cargo space. Common complaints include the vehicle's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, relatively poor fuel economy, and some reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (L86)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, ticking or knocking noises, and potential for significant engine damage. The AFM lifters can collapse, causing the affected cylinders to stop firing. This issue is most common on vehicles with high mileage or those that have not had regular oil changes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed AFM lifters, often along with the affected cylinder head and camshaft. A complete AFM delete is another solution which replaces the camshaft, lifters, and sometimes the ECU to disable AFM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust. This issue is attributed to the piston ring design.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the pistons and rings with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly when shifting between gears at lower speeds. Hesitation or delay when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) might temporarily improve the shift quality. However, replacing valve body or even the entire transmission is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Software Update) - $4,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibration or shudder felt at highway speeds, often when the transmission is in higher gears. This is due to the torque converter clutch not engaging smoothly.
    *   Solution: Transmission flush with updated Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid. If that does not resolve the issue, torque converter replacement is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$500 (Transmission Flush), $1,000 - $2,500+ (Torque Converter Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid from the shock absorbers, diminished ride quality, and increased body roll during cornering. A "Service Ride Control" message may appear on the dashboard. MRC shocks are prone to failure, especially with age and mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed MRC shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per shock (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Cadillac User Experience (CUE) infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other features.
    *   Solution: Software updates may improve stability. Replacement of the CUE screen or the entire infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Software Update), $500 - $1,500+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is parked for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw, which may involve testing and replacing faulty modules or components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings. This can reduce headlight brightness and potentially damage the bulbs or electrical components.
    *   Solution: Removal of the headlight housing to dry it out and reseal it. In some cases, headlight replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Resealing), $500 - $1,000+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **CUE Screen Delamination/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CUE touchscreen display delaminates or cracks, making it difficult to see or operate. This is a common issue with the CUE system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CUE screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Cadillac Escalade ESV, while luxurious and powerful, is subject to several common issues. The most concerning are the potential for engine problems related to AFM lifter failure and excessive oil consumption, which can be quite costly to repair. Transmission issues such as harsh shifting and torque converter shudder are also prevalent. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, can be frustrating. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs like engine or transmission replacement can be very expensive. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect any used Escalade ESV before purchasing.
