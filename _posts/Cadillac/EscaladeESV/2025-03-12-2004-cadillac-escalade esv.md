The 2004 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. While appreciated for its luxury features and towing capability, the 2004 Escalade ESV does have some commonly reported issues. The standard engine was a 5.3L V8 producing around 290 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 6.0L V8 producing 345 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. The 5.3L was paired with a 4L60E 4-speed transmission while the 6.0L was paired with a 4L65E 4-speed transmission. Owners often praise the Escalade ESV for its ample passenger and cargo space, as well as its smooth ride. However, common complaints include poor fuel economy, the relatively dated technology compared to newer vehicles, and some reliability concerns, especially with the electrical system and drivetrain.

**Engine**

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently between oil changes. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and adding oil as needed. In some cases, replacing valve stem seals or piston rings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L V8**

*   **No Known Issues**

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic (Paired with 5.3L V8)**

*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report hard or erratic shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs but the vehicle does not accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission with a rebuilt unit, or performing a full rebuild of the existing unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4L65E 4-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.0L V8)**

*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4L60E, the 4L65E can experience hard or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. Slipping can also occur, especially under heavy acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission with a rebuilt unit or a full rebuild of the existing unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Escalade ESV is equipped with air suspension in the rear, which can fail over time. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting unevenly (lower on one side), the air compressor running constantly, or a suspension warning light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs, the air compressor, or both. Also, checking and replacing any faulty air lines. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the components replaced and whether converting to coil springs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument panel cluster (speedometer, tachometer, etc.) can malfunction, with gauges reading incorrectly or not at all.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument panel cluster. Some shops specialize in repairing these clusters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a parasitic battery drain, where the battery is drained overnight or after a few days of sitting.
    *   Solution: Identifying and fixing the source of the drain, which can be a faulty module, a short circuit, or an accessory left on.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Cadillac Escalade ESV, while a luxurious and spacious vehicle, does have its share of potential problems. Issues with the transmission, particularly hard shifting and slipping, can be costly to repair. Electrical problems, such as instrument panel cluster failures and battery drain, are also relatively common. The air suspension system is another potential source of expense, especially as the vehicle ages. While the 5.3L can have issues with oil consumption, the 6.0L is more reliable. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any used 2004 Escalade ESV before purchasing.
