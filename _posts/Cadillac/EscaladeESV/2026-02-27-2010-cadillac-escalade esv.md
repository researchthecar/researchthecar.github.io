### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers and owners should be aware of common issues. The 6.2L V8 engine's Active Fuel Management system is a notable area for potential problems, often leading to oil consumption and internal component wear. Transmission issues, particularly with the 6-speed automatic, can manifest as slipping or harsh shifting. The advanced Magnetic Ride Control suspension, while providing a superior ride, can be costly to repair if shocks or struts fail. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and power liftgate malfunctions, are also reported. Interior climate control blend door actuators are another common point of failure. Despite these potential issues, many Escalades are well-maintained and can offer reliable service with proactive attention to these known problem areas.
