The 2010 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spaciousness, powerful engine, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine option: a 6.2L Vortec V8 engine producing around 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the vehicle's towing capacity, luxurious features, and smooth ride. Common dislikes include poor fuel economy and the sheer size of the vehicle, making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**6.2L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, and potential engine damage. This issue is related to the AFM system that shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy. The lifters can collapse, leading to the symptoms mentioned.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters is a common repair. Many owners opt to delete the AFM system entirely to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often more than 1 quart every 1,000 miles. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored and addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve seals, piston rings, or even a full engine rebuild are possible solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, and difficulty shifting gears. The torque converter can fail due to wear and tear or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, sometimes accompanied by slipping. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission flush, valve body repair/replacement, or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, especially after sitting overnight. The air compressor that maintains the correct ride height can fail due to wear or leaks in the air lines or air shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air compressor, air shocks, or repairing/replacing the air lines. Many owners convert to a traditional coil-over suspension to eliminate future air suspension problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Autoride Shocks Leaking/Failing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, especially over bumps. The Autoride shocks, which use electronically controlled dampening, can leak fluid and lose their effectiveness.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Autoride shocks. These shocks are significantly more expensive than standard shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (for a pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, glitching, or complete failure of the navigation and infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days of not being driven. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the parasitic draw. This often involves systematically disconnecting electrical components to identify the source of the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may not open or close properly, or may make unusual noises. This can be caused by a faulty liftgate motor, damaged hinges, or issues with the sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate motor, hinges, or sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters not working or only partially working.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Cadillac Escalade ESV can be a comfortable and luxurious vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine-related problems like AFM lifter failure and oil consumption can be expensive to fix. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension and Autoride shocks, are also prevalent and costly. Electrical gremlins and liftgate problems can also surface. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, potentially impacting the overall ownership experience.
