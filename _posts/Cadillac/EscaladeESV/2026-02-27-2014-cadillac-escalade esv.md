### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a capable luxury SUV with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The most common reported issues revolve around the powertrain, specifically the Active Fuel Management system in the 6.2L V8 engine and potential torque converter issues in the 6-speed automatic transmission. The advanced suspension systems, including Magnetic Ride Control and rear air suspension, can also be sources of repair costs if components fail.
