A popular choice for families needing space and those desiring a premium driving experience, the Escalade ESV offered a blend of comfort and capability. The 2011 Escalade ESV comes standard with a 6.2L V8 engine that produces 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Escalade ESV for its towing capacity, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior. Common dislikes include its large size which makes it difficult to park in tight spaces and relatively poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy. The AFM lifters are prone to failure, leading to misfires, rough running, and a ticking noise from the engine. This often happens at higher mileages.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed AFM lifters with updated non-AFM lifters is a common fix. This often requires removing the cylinder heads. Disabling the AFM system via tuning or aftermarket devices is sometimes done in conjunction with the lifter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can occur, sometimes linked to the AFM system and its impact on the piston rings. Drivers may notice a need to add oil frequently between oil changes and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Addressing this may involve replacing the valve seals, piston rings, or even the entire engine, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. Slipping can also occur during acceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may provide temporary relief. More permanent solutions include valve body replacement, a transmission rebuild, or a complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter shudder or failure can lead to vibrations at certain speeds, especially under light load.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter is usually the fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with the Autoride suspension, the air suspension compressor can fail, leading to the rear of the vehicle sagging or not maintaining the correct ride height. Warning lights related to the suspension system will illuminate on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor. It is advised to also inspect and possibly replace the air shocks in conjunction with the compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magnetic Ride Control Shock Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Magnetic Ride Control shocks can leak or lose their damping ability, resulting in a bouncy or uncontrolled ride.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected Magnetic Ride Control shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per shock (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can be a common issue. This can lead to the vehicle not starting or requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the drain can be challenging. Common culprits include the radio, OnStar module, or other electrical accessories not fully shutting down when the vehicle is turned off. A parasitic draw test is needed to diagnose the problem and the faulty component replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component causing the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation or infotainment system can freeze, glitch, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. Component replacement might be necessary in other situations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power rear liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may only open partially.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Delamination of Dashboard/Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Separation of the leather or vinyl from the underlying plastic on the dashboard and door panels. This is most common in hot climates or areas with high sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Repairing delamination is difficult, and typically involves removing the affected panel and re-adhering the material. Complete replacement is often the best solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per panel (depending on the severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to work or become excessively hot.
    *   Solution: Replacing the seat heater element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per seat
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a luxurious and capable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine issues, particularly with the AFM system and oil consumption, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, electrical issues and suspension issues also pose potential concerns. Interior issues like delamination can affect the overall appearance of the vehicle. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the condition of these key components. Addressing the AFM issue, suspension, and transmission promptly can significantly reduce long-term ownership costs.
