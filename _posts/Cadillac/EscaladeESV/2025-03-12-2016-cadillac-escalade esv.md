**Engine**

**6.2L EcoTec3 V8 (L86)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. Often presents as a ticking or knocking noise from the top of the engine. Diagnostic codes related to misfires on specific cylinders may be present (e.g., P0300, P0301, P0302, etc.). This issue occurs when the AFM lifters collapse and fail to properly engage or disengage cylinders as needed, because the VLOM (valve lifter oil manifold) is not operating properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty AFM lifters with updated lifters. Often recommended to replace all lifters while the engine is disassembled. Replacement of the VLOM. In some cases, a complete AFM delete kit is installed, which disables the AFM system altogether (requires tuning).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the valve cover with the updated version is a possible fix. In other cases, the oil rings on the pistons are replaced to prevent oil from seeping through.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Torque converter shudder, feeling like a vibration or shaking during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Replacement of the valve body. Replacing the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+

**Summary**

The 2016 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a luxurious and spacious SUV that can be prone to a few common issues. The most concerning and potentially expensive issues revolve around the engine (AFM lifter failure and oil consumption) and transmission (harsh shifting). Electrical issues with the CUE system and suspension problems with the MRC system are also frequently reported. While some issues may be minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase, including checking the service history and considering a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
