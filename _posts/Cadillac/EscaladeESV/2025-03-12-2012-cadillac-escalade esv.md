The 2012 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spaciousness, powerful engine, and upscale features. Available with a single engine option, a 6.2L V8 producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, the Escalade ESV offers ample power for towing and hauling. Owners appreciate its comfortable ride and abundant cargo space but often cite the high fuel consumption, large size making it difficult to maneuver, and some reliability concerns as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8 (L94)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. The lifters responsible for this process can fail, leading to a ticking noise, misfires, rough idling, and eventually engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can occur, sometimes exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. This can be due to worn piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions range from using a heavier weight oil to replacing the piston rings and/or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed, harsh, or erratic shifts. May experience slipping between gears, especially when cold.
    * Solution: May be caused by valve body issues, worn clutches, or low fluid level. Solution ranges from fluid flush to valve body repair or full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
