### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Cadillac Escalade ESV is a largely reliable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of specific common issues. The 6.2L V8 engine can experience problems related to its Active Fuel Management system and oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. The 8-speed automatic transmission may exhibit harsh shifting, often resolvable with software updates, but sometimes requiring more extensive internal work. The advanced Magnetic Ride Control suspension, while providing a superior ride, can develop leaks in its struts. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the CUE infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Despite these potential concerns, many owners find the Escalade ESV to be a dependable vehicle when these issues are addressed proactively.
