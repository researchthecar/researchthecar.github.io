*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between oil changes. This can be caused by worn piston rings or valve stem seals. Symptoms include blue exhaust smoke and a low oil level warning.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution can range from using a higher viscosity oil to replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the repair needed.
