The 6.0L V8 engine can develop intake manifold gasket or oil cooler line leaks. The 4L65-E transmission is prone to torque converter problems and overheating, especially under heavy use. If equipped with the optional adaptive air suspension, leaks and compressor failures are notable concerns. Electrical issues, particularly with the Body Control Module and alternator, can manifest as intermittent problems or outright failure. Interior climate control blend doors and older infotainment systems can also require attention. Despite these potential drawbacks, addressing them proactively can help maintain the Escalade ESV's functionality and comfort.
