The 2019 Cadillac CT6 is a large luxury sedan offering a blend of comfort, technology, and performance. While it's praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available Super Cruise driver-assistance system, it's not without its potential issues. Engine options for the 2019 CT6 included a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (237 hp, 258 lb-ft), a 3.6L naturally aspirated V6 (335 hp, 285 lb-ft), and a 4.2L twin-turbocharged V8 ("Blackwing" engine, 500-550 hp, 574-640 lb-ft depending on trim). A 10-speed automatic transmission was paired with the V6 and V8 engines, while the 2.0L turbo had an 8-speed automatic. Criticisms often include the infotainment system's learning curve and some material choices that don't quite match the luxury price point.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption. The car may need to have oil added more frequently than the service interval would normally require.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks are important. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection should be performed to identify the source. Potential fixes could include replacing PCV valve, valve stem seals, or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity and parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Naturally Aspirated V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature timing chain wear, leading to engine noise (rattling at startup or while running), check engine light, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and possibly related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.2L Twin-Turbocharged V8 ("Blackwing" Engine)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (V6 and V8 Models)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported complaints of the 10-speed transmission exhibiting rough or harsh shifts, especially between certain gears. Some report hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software reflash/update of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue in some cases. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (reflash) to $3000 - $7000+ (valve body or transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (2.0L Turbo Models)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported complaints of the 8-speed transmission exhibiting rough or harsh shifts, especially between certain gears. Some report hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software reflash/update of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue in some cases. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (reflash) to $3000 - $7000+ (valve body or transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CT6 offered Magnetic Ride Control. Some owners have experienced failures of the magnetic ride control struts/shocks, leading to a degraded ride quality, clunking noises, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed magnetic ride control strut/shock.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per strut/shock (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent freezing, slow response times, screen blackouts, and issues with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, the infotainment system module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update is covered under warranty) to $500 - $1500+ (infotainment module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found
* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially if the car sits for extended periods.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the source of the drain (e.g., faulty module not sleeping, parasitic draw from aftermarket accessories). Replacing the battery may be necessary, but addressing the underlying cause is critical.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (new battery) to $100 - $1000+ (diagnosing and repairing the parasitic draw).
    * Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Cadillac CT6, while a luxurious and technologically advanced vehicle, has its share of potential problems. Engine and transmission issues, particularly with the 2.0L turbo, the 3.6L V6, and both automatic transmissions, can lead to costly repairs. Electrical glitches and suspension issues are also potential concerns. While some issues may be minor inconveniences, others can be more significant and expensive to fix, so a thorough pre-purchase inspection is advisable.
