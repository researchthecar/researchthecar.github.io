**2017 Cadillac CT6**

The 2017 Cadillac CT6 is a full-size luxury sedan that offers a choice of two engines: a 3.6L V6 or a 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The CT6 has received praise for its spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and advanced technology features. However, it has also been criticized for its high price and some reliability issues.

**Engine**

* **Solution:** Replace the faulty turbocharger(s).
* **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,500 - $4,000+ per turbocharger

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission shudder:** The transmission may shudder or vibrate during shifts. This is typically caused by worn or damaged clutches.
