**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs.  Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil between scheduled changes. This can stem from piston ring issues.
    *   Solution:  Diagnosis may involve oil consumption tests.  Replacement of piston rings may be required in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L V6, like other engines in the GM family, can be susceptible to timing chain wear. Symptoms include a rattling noise at startup, check engine light with codes related to timing, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.  In some cases, camshaft phasers may also need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The high pressure fuel pump is responsible for sending fuel to the high pressure fuel rail. If this part fails, the vehicle may not start or stall while driving.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**

    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the specific turbocharger component that has failed.  Replacement of the affected turbocharger or actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ per turbocharger
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The GM 8-speed automatic (specifically the 8L45 or 8L90 depending on engine) used in the CT6 has been known to exhibit harsh shifting, hesitation, and "clunking" noises, especially during low-speed operation or when shifting between gears. The torque converter is a common cause.
    *   Solution:  A transmission fluid flush using the updated Mobil 1 Synthetic LV ATF HP fluid (blue label).  In some cases, a valve body replacement or torque converter replacement might be necessary.  Software updates can also sometimes address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $300-$500, Valve Body Replacement $800-$1500, Torque Converter $1000-$2500
    *   Recalls: None Found
