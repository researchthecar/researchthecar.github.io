Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system, are also noted. However, many owners experience trouble-free operation, especially with routine maintenance. The suspension and interior/exterior components are largely free from widespread defects. Prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for these specific issues, especially when considering the 2.0L turbo engine and the advanced suspension systems.
