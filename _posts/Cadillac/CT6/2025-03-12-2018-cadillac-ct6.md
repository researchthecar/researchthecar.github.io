The 2018 Cadillac CT6 is a full-size luxury sedan that aimed to blend comfort, technology, and performance. Engine options included a 2.0L Turbo I4 (265 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (335 hp, 284 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Twin Turbo V6 (404 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, except for the 3.0L Twin Turbo V6, which used a 10-speed automatic. Owners often praise the CT6 for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and advanced technology features. However, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, occasional electrical glitches, and concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbo I4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms can include low oil level warnings, and in severe cases, potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If consumption is excessive, consult a mechanic. Potential fixes could include replacing piston rings or valve seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature timing chain wear or failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, check engine light, and potential engine misfires.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the timing chain for excessive slack or wear. Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Twin Turbo V6**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Potential turbocharger failures can occur. Symptoms include a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine (whining or screeching), excessive smoke from the exhaust, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves inspecting the turbocharger for damage or wear. Replacement of the affected turbocharger is the typical solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (per turbo)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Used with 2.0L Turbo I4 and 3.6L V6)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation during acceleration or delayed engagement can also occur.
    * Solution: Some cases are resolved with a transmission fluid flush and software update. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic (Used with 3.0L Twin Turbo V6)**

* **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough shifting, slipping between gears, and hesitation during acceleration.
    * Solution: Initially, a software update or transmission fluid flush might be attempted. If the issue persists, valve body issues or internal damage might require more extensive repairs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicles equipped with MRC may experience failure of the shocks. Symptoms include a loss of damping ability, resulting in a bouncy or unstable ride. Error messages on the dash related to the suspension system may also appear.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves inspecting the shocks for leaks or damage. Replacement of the affected MRC shocks is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ per shock
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, unresponsive touchscreen, and Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    * Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve the issue. In other cases, the infotainment system module may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (module replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially when the vehicle is parked. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or requiring frequent jump starts.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves testing the battery and charging system, as well as checking for parasitic draws. Common causes include a faulty body control module (BCM) or other electrical components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (battery replacement) - $1,000+ (BCM replacement/electrical diagnosis)
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Backup Camera Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may intermittently fail to display an image, or the image may be distorted or blurry.
    * Solution: Check the camera connection for damage or corrosion. Replacement of the camera module is usually necessary if the issue is internal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, make excessive noise when opening/closing, or leak.
    * Solution: Inspect the sunroof tracks for debris or damage. Lubrication may resolve the issue. In some cases, the sunroof motor or entire assembly may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (lubrication/cleaning) - $1,000+ (motor/assembly replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Cadillac CT6 presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine issues, particularly with oil consumption on the 2.0L Turbo and timing chain problems on the 3.6L V6, can be costly to address. Transmission issues across both the 8-speed and 10-speed automatics are also a concern. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and battery drain, are common annoyances. Suspension problems with the MRC system can impact ride quality. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any prospective purchase or get a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic.
