The 2014 Cadillac ELR is a luxury coupe featuring an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) powertrain. It combines a 1.4L gasoline engine with an electric motor and battery pack, delivering a combined 217 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. There were no other engine options. The ELR offers a stylish design and luxurious interior, appealing to buyers interested in fuel efficiency and distinctive styling. Common likes include its unique design, quiet operation in electric mode, and well-appointed cabin. Dislikes often center around its relatively high price for its performance, limited rear passenger space, and some concerns about long-term battery life and reliability.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Drive Unit**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may display a "Reduced Propulsion Power" message on the driver information center, and the vehicle's acceleration is significantly limited. This can occur intermittently or become a persistent issue. The cause can be a faulty battery module, issues with the electric drive unit itself, or problems with the charging system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves scanning the vehicle's computer for diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs). Repair may require replacing a faulty battery module or the entire battery pack, replacing the electric drive unit, or fixing related wiring and connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $10,000+ depending on the failed component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Battery Management System monitors and controls the battery pack's performance. Issues with the BMS can lead to inaccurate state-of-charge readings, reduced battery range, failure to fully charge, or premature battery degradation.
    *   Solution: Diagnose with diagnostic tool to check the BMS for any error codes. Repair can range from a software update, to a replacement of the BMS unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Range Extender Engine**

**1.4L Inline-4 Engine (Range Extender)**

*   **Check Engine Light with Codes Related to Fuel System or Emissions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While the 1.4L engine primarily serves as a generator, issues within its fuel system or emissions control components can trigger the check engine light. Common causes include a faulty mass airflow sensor, a loose or damaged gas cap, or issues with the EVAP system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis requires scanning for diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) with an OBD-II scanner. Repair may involve replacing the faulty sensor or component, tightening the gas cap, or repairing/replacing the affected part of the EVAP system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ELR is equipped with Magnetic Ride Control which can encounter issues, leading to a rough ride or diminished handling. Problems may include failure of one or more of the shocks, resulting in uneven damping. The shocks may also leak fluid, reducing their effectiveness.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis includes visually inspecting the shocks for leaks and using a diagnostic tool to check for related DTCs. Repair involves replacing the faulty shock absorber(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Charging System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the vehicle's charging system can prevent the car from charging correctly. This may manifest as failure to charge at all, slow charging, or error messages during the charging process. The problem could be with the onboard charger, the charging port, or the external charging equipment.
    *   Solution: Diagnose by testing the charging system with a multimeter or specialized diagnostic tool. Repair may require replacing the onboard charger, repairing or replacing the charging port, or troubleshooting and resolving any issues with the charging circuit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Cadillac User Experience (CUE) infotainment system in the ELR can suffer from various glitches, including freezing, slow response times, screen delamination, and failure to connect to mobile devices.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the system by performing a software reset. Repair may involve replacing the entire CUE unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation can accumulate inside the tail light housings. While it may not affect functionality, it can be visually unappealing.
    *   Solution: If the condensation is severe, the tail light housing may need to be removed and resealed, or the entire tail light assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per tail light
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to function properly, providing either no heat or inconsistent heating. This could be due to a faulty heating element, a malfunctioning switch, or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose by testing the heating element with a multimeter and inspecting the wiring and switch. Repair usually involves replacing the faulty heating element or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2014 Cadillac ELR has a mix of potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most serious concerns revolve around the electric drive unit and battery management system, which can be expensive to repair if problems arise. The range extender engine has a couple of minor issues. Problems with the suspension, electrical system, infotainment system, and other components, while generally less severe, can contribute to overall ownership costs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these systems before purchasing a used ELR and factor in potential repair costs, especially considering the age of the vehicle.
