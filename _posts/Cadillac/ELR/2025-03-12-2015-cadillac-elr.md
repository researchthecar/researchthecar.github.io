The 2015 Cadillac ELR is a luxury coupe featuring an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) powertrain. It combines a 1.4L inline-4 gasoline engine (84 hp) acting as a generator with a 17.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack and two electric motors (217 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque combined). The gas engine is used solely to generate electricity and extend the driving range, it does not directly power the wheels. Drivers appreciate the ELR's sleek styling, quiet operation in electric mode, and luxurious interior. Some common complaints include its high original price, limited rear passenger space, and relatively low all-electric range compared to newer electric vehicles.

**Electric Motor**

* **Electric Motor Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of reduced propulsion, potentially leading to the vehicle slowing down or stopping unexpectedly. This is often related to the Battery Energy Control Module (BECM).
    * Solution: Diagnose the issue using a scan tool. In most cases, the BECM needs to be reprogrammed or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

* **Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Like all electric vehicles, the ELR's battery can experience degradation over time, reducing its maximum range. The amount of degradation depends on factors like usage, charging habits, and climate.
    * Solution: There is no simple fix for battery degradation. Individual cells or modules can be replaced if they are faulty but typically replacing the entire battery pack is the best solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Charging System**

* **Charging Port Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the vehicle not charging, or charging very slowly. This can be caused by a faulty charging port, wiring issues, or problems with the onboard charger.
    * Solution: Inspect the charging port for damage or corrosion. Test the charging circuit and onboard charger. Repair or replace any faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The ELR uses Cadillac's Magnetic Ride Control suspension, which can sometimes experience issues. Symptoms include a rough ride, clunking noises, or a "Service Ride Control" message on the dashboard. This can be caused by failing shocks or damaged wiring.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty component. Replacing a MRC shock is a common fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per shock
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The CUE (Cadillac User Experience) infotainment system can sometimes be slow, unresponsive, or experience glitches. Some owners have reported issues with the touchscreen freezing or the system crashing.
    * Solution: Try resetting the system. Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In some cases, the entire CUE unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Key Fob Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Issues with key fobs not being recognized, or not unlocking/locking the doors.
    * Solution: Try replacing the battery in the key fob. If that doesn't work, the key fob may need to be reprogrammed, or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported condensation forming inside the headlight housings.
    * Solution: Replacing the headlights is the most common fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per headlight
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Cadillac ELR can experience issues related to its electric drivetrain, particularly battery degradation and BECM problems. The Magnetic Ride Control suspension can also be a source of concern. While electrical gremlins such as CUE infotainment issues and key fob malfunctions are present, they're not overwhelmingly common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to costly repairs, with potential battery replacements representing the most substantial expense. Overall, the ELR can be a stylish and enjoyable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the potential for these specific problems.
