The 2016 Cadillac ELR is a luxury coupe that combines electric propulsion with a gasoline range extender, offering a unique blend of efficiency and performance. It features a 1.4L inline 4-cylinder range extender engine paired with a 17.1 kWh battery pack and a two-motor electric drive system. This powertrain delivers a combined output of 217 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. The ELR was praised for its striking design, luxurious interior, and quiet electric driving experience. However, some owners found the range to be limited compared to newer electric vehicles and the price to be high for the performance offered. Common complaints include the complexity of the hybrid system, reliance on software controls, and limited back seat space.

**Electric Motor**

**Two-Motor Electric Drive System**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a sudden loss of power while driving, especially when the battery is depleted and the gasoline range extender is engaged. This can be caused by software glitches or issues with the battery management system limiting power output.
    *   Solution: Requires software updates or recalibration of the battery management system by a qualified technician. In some cases, battery degradation can also cause this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ for software updates and diagnosis; battery replacement can be significantly more expensive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Pack Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the battery pack can experience degradation, leading to reduced range and performance. This is a common issue with all electric vehicles, but the ELR's smaller battery pack makes the impact more noticeable.
    *   Solution: Battery rebalancing or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery rebalancing - $300-$700, Battery replacement: $7,000-$10,000+ depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light / Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "Check Engine" light illuminating on the dashboard can be triggered by a variety of issues within the engine and emissions systems. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) can be read using an OBD-II scanner to pinpoint the source of the problem, which could range from minor sensor malfunctions to more serious engine or emissions control issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with an OBD-II scanner to identify the DTC, then repair or replace the affected component. This can involve sensors, vacuum lines, spark plugs, or other engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the fault, this can include the cost of a shop doing a diagnostic.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine misfires, especially when the range extender engine is first started or under heavy load. This can cause rough running, reduced power, and poor fuel economy. Potential causes include faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to isolate the source of the misfire, followed by replacement of the faulty components. This may involve replacing spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the components needing to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the ELR's charging system, including failures to charge, slow charging speeds, or error messages during charging. This can be caused by faulty charging equipment, problems with the vehicle's charging port, or issues with the battery management system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the charging system, including inspection of the charging equipment, charging port, and battery management system. Depending on the issue, the charging equipment may need to be replaced, the charging port repaired, or the battery management system recalibrated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity of the issue and what parts need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **CUE Screen Delamination**
