**1997 Cadillac Catera**

The 1997 Cadillac Catera was a luxury sedan that offered a refined driving experience and a spacious interior. It was available with two engine options: a 3.0L V6 and a 2.5L V6, and two transmission options: a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual. Despite its premium status, the Catera faced some reliability issues that affected owner satisfaction.

**Engine**

* **3.0L V6**
    * **Oil Leaks:** The engine may develop oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots underneath the vehicle and low oil levels. The fix involves replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket may fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include coolant and oil mixing, overheating, and rough idling. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner may fail, leading to a rattling noise from the engine. Ignoring this issue can result in catastrophic engine damage. The fix is to replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200
* **2.5L V6**
    * **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

* **4-speed Automatic**
    * **Transmission Slipping:** The transmission may slip or hesitate during gear changes. This can be caused by worn clutch packs or a faulty torque converter. The solution involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
* **5-speed Manual**

The fix involves isolating and repairing the source of the draw. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the source of the draw
* **Exterior Lighting Malfunctions:** Exterior lighting components, such as headlights, taillights, or turn signals, may malfunction due to faulty bulbs, wiring, or switches. The solution is to replace the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
