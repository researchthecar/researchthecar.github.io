The 2000 Cadillac Catera is a mid-size luxury sedan that was produced from 1997 to 2001. It was available with a choice of two engines: a 3.0-liter V6 or a 4.0-liter V8. Both engines were mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The Catera was praised for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and refined ride, but it was also criticized for its high price and lack of rear-seat legroom.
