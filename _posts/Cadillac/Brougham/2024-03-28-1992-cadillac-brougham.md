**Introduction:**

The 1992 Cadillac Brougham is a full-size luxury sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. It was available with two engine options: a 5.7L V8 with 185 horsepower and 270 lb-ft torque, and a 5.0L V8 with 170 horsepower and 300 lb-ft torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**5.7L V8**

* **Blown Head Gaskets:** Head gaskets fail due to overheating, causing coolant leaks, white smoke from the exhaust, and engine misfires. Replacing head gaskets is labor-intensive and can cost $1,500 - $3,000+.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks:** Gaskets wear out and leak coolant, causing low coolant levels and engine overheating. Replacing intake manifold gaskets costs around $500 - $800.

**5.0L V8**

* **Oil Consumption:** Pistons and piston rings wear prematurely, leading to excessive oil consumption. Fixing this issue typically requires an engine rebuild, which can cost $3,000 - $5,000+.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Problems:** Internal components wear out, causing transmission to slip or shift harshly. Rebuilding the transmission is recommended and costs around $2,000 - $3,000.

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Failure:** Mounts wear out, causing noises and a bumpy ride. Replacing strut mounts costs around $200 - $400 per set.
* **Rear Springs Sagging:** Springs weaken over time, resulting in a sagging rear end. Replacing rear springs costs around $300 - $500 per pair.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** Alternator fails to charge the battery, causing power loss and electrical system issues. Replacing an alternator costs around $400 - $700.
* **Battery Drain:** Electrical components or wiring may draw parasitic current, draining the battery even when the car is parked. Locating and fixing the drain issue can cost $100 - $300+.

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** Body panels are prone to rust, especially around the wheel arches and rocker panels. Rust repair costs can vary greatly depending on the severity.
* **Headlight Fade:** Headlight covers gradually oxidize and fade, reducing visibility at night. Replacing headlight covers costs around $150 - $300 per pair.

**Interior**

* **HVAC Control Panel Failure:** Control panel malfunctions, affecting climate control functions. Replacing the control panel costs around $500 - $800.
* **Cruise Control Module Failure:** Module fails, preventing cruise control from working. Replacing the cruise control module costs around $200 - $350.

**Summary**

The 1992 Cadillac Brougham is a classic luxury sedan with some notable issues. While engine and transmission problems can be severe and expensive, most other issues are relatively minor and affordable to fix. Overall, the Brougham offers a comfortable and spacious driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of its maintenance requirements.
