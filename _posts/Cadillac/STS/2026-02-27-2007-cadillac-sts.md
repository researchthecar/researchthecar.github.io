### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Cadillac STS presents a mixed reliability profile. The V6 and V8 engines can be prone to oil leaks and, in the case of the V6, timing chain issues. The automatic transmission may exhibit harsh shifting or torque converter problems. Suspension components, particularly front control arm bushings, are a common wear item that can lead to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module or infotainment system, can also arise. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of these powertrain, suspension, and electrical concerns. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
