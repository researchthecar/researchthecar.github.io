### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Cadillac STS presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core structure and luxury appointments are generally solid, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the engines (oil and coolant leaks, timing chains on the 3.6L) and the automatic transmission (harsh shifting, torque converter). Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and sensors, can also arise. If the vehicle is equipped with air suspension, leaks are a common concern. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are repairable, and a well-maintained STS can still offer a comfortable and stylish driving experience. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
