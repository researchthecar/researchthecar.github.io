The 2000 Cadillac DeVille is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and distinctive styling. It was offered with a single engine option, the 4.6L Northstar V8, which produced approximately 275 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option was a 4T80-E four-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the smooth ride and roomy cabin of the DeVille. Common complaints often revolved around the reliability of the Northstar engine, particularly regarding head gasket issues, and general electrical gremlins common in vehicles of this era.
