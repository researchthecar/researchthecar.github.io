**Engine**

**4.6L Northstar V8**

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and milky residue under the oil filler cap. The Northstar engine is known for head bolt threads pulling from the aluminum block, leading to coolant entering the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Repairing the head gasket on a Northstar engine typically involves removing the cylinder heads, machining the surfaces, and installing new head gaskets along with time-sert or similar thread repair inserts in the block to provide a stronger hold for the head bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, low oil level. Common leak points include the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal. Multiple resealing procedures may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. The Northstar engine has individual coil-on-plug ignition coils that can fail over time.
