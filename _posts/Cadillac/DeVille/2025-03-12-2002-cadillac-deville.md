The 2002 Cadillac DeVille is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and distinctive styling. It was available with the 4.6L Northstar V8 engine. The Northstar V8 produced 275 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque in the base DeVille and DHS trims. The DeVille was only available with the 4T80E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the car's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and powerful engine, but common complaints included issues with the electronics, excessive oil consumption, and costly repairs.

**Summary**

The 2002 Cadillac DeVille, while luxurious and comfortable, is prone to several common issues. Engine problems, particularly excessive oil consumption and head gasket failures in the Northstar V8, can be costly to repair. Suspension issues, especially with the air suspension system (if equipped), and electrical problems are also common. While many of these issues are related to the vehicle's age, they should be considered when evaluating a potential purchase. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, but potential buyers should be prepared for potentially expensive maintenance and repair bills.
