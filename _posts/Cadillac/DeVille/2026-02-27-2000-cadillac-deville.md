### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Cadillac DeVille, while offering a comfortable and luxurious experience, presents several potential reliability concerns common to vehicles of its age and luxury segment. The Northstar V8 engine is known for potential head gasket and intake manifold issues, requiring significant repair costs. The transmission, while generally robust, can experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components, particularly on models with the optional active system, can be costly to repair.
