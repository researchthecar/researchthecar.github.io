The 2001 Cadillac DeVille is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was offered with the 4.6L Northstar V8 engine, producing around 275 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque for the base and DHS models. The DTS trim bumped that to 300 hp. All trims were equipped with a 4T80-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the smooth ride, powerful engine, and comfortable seats. Criticisms often include the floaty handling, dated styling, and some reliability issues.
