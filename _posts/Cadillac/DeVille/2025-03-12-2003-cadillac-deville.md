**Engine**

**4.6L Northstar V8**

*   **Coolant Leaks (Primarily Head Gasket)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, milky oil. The Northstar engine is known for head gasket failures due to the use of aluminum block and heads with steel head bolts, which can cause corrosion and weakening of the head bolt threads in the aluminum block.
    *   Solution: Head gasket replacement. While some attempt to use thread inserts to repair the block threads, a full engine replacement may be considered if the block is severely damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on repair method and shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, burning oil smell, low oil level. Common leak areas include valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket: $200 - $400, Oil pan gasket: $300 - $600, Rear main seal: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light.
