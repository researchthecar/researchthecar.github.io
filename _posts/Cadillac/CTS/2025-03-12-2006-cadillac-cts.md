The 2006 Cadillac CTS is a rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan that offers a blend of style and performance. It was available with three engine options: a 2.8L V6 (210 hp, 195 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (255 hp, 252 lb-ft of torque), and a 6.0L LS2 V8 (400 hp, 395 lb-ft of torque) exclusive to the CTS-V. The V6 engines were paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the CTS-V came exclusively with a 6-speed manual. Owners often appreciate the CTS's sharp styling, sporty handling (especially the CTS-V), and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include some lower-quality interior materials, occasional electrical issues, and the relatively small rear seat.

Electrical problems with the instrument cluster and door locks are also relatively frequent. Suspension issues, like the rear differential bushings, can affect handling and comfort. Overall, while the CTS offers a good blend of performance and luxury, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of repairs when considering a purchase. The severity of the problems ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major engine repairs, and costs can vary significantly depending on the issue and the repair shop.
