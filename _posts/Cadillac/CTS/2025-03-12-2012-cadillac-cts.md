The 2012 Cadillac CTS is a luxury car appreciated for its sharp styling, comfortable ride, and engaging driving dynamics. Available as a sedan, coupe, and wagon, it offers a variety of engine and transmission choices. Owners generally praise its handling, interior comfort, and distinctive design. Common complaints include some reliability issues, a somewhat dated infotainment system for the model year, and rear seat space in the coupe model. The 2012 CTS offers three engine options: a 3.0L V6 producing 270 hp and 223 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 producing 318 hp and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.2L Supercharged V8 in the CTS-V producing 556 hp and 551 lb-ft of torque. All engines except the CTS-V are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The CTS-V has the option of either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2012 Cadillac CTS presents a mixed bag of potential issues. The timing chain problems on the V6 engines are perhaps the most serious, potentially leading to significant engine damage and costly repairs. The supercharger isolator failure on the CTS-V is also a moderately expensive repair. Electrical issues such as the CUE system problems are common and can be frustrating. Suspension issues related to the Magnetic Ride Control can become expensive if multiple shocks need replacement. Overall, while the CTS offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor potential repair costs into their purchase decision. Addressing any of these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
