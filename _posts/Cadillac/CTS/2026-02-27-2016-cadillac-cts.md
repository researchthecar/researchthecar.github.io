### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Cadillac CTS presents a generally reliable luxury sedan experience, particularly with its powertrain options. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the turbocharged 2.0L engine's turbocharger and potential coolant leaks, as well as the 3.6L V6's timing chain and oil leaks. Transmission problems, primarily concerning harsh shifting and torque converter issues with the 8-speed automatic, are also noted. Suspension components, especially bushings and the optional Magnetic Ride Control system, can require attention. Electrical gremlins, most notably with the CUE infotainment system's touchscreen and occasional battery drain, are also present. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most common non-wear-and-tear concerns for this model year.
