Engine options included a 3.6L V6 engine producing approximately 304 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L V6 engine producing approximately 210 horsepower and 194 lb-ft of torque. The CTS was praised for its sharp handling, distinctive design, and well-appointed interior. However, some common complaints included electrical issues, and certain mechanical failures.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or wear prematurely, leading to a check engine light, rough running, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on start-up. Error codes P0008 and P0017 are commonly associated with this issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and possibly the camshaft actuators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, rough idling, difficulty starting, and potential check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**Both Transmissions**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. May also experience rough shifting or slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift. The check engine light may illuminate with transmission-related diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs).
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some cases, flushing the transmission and replacing the fluid may temporarily alleviate symptoms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension - Excessive Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension bushings. Often involves replacing the entire control arm as the bushings are integrated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation/infotainment screen may flicker, display lines or become completely unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the screen unit or the entire infotainment system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on repair vs. replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks may fail to lock or unlock, either intermittently or completely.

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for a few days. Can be caused by a variety of factors, including a faulty alternator, parasitic drain from an electrical component, or a bad battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the battery drain. This may involve testing the alternator, checking for parasitic draws, and replacing the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**

**Summary**

The 2009 Cadillac CTS presents owners with a range of potential issues, from relatively minor electrical problems to more significant engine and transmission failures. Timing chain issues on the 3.6L V6 engine can be costly to repair, while transmission problems like torque converter failure and valve body issues are also common. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and door lock actuators are fairly frequent. While many of the issues aren't catastophic, the cost to repair these issues can add up quickly as the vehicle ages. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the car inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
