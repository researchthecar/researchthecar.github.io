### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Cadillac CTS, while offering a compelling package for its era, exhibits common issues associated with aging luxury vehicles. Engine oil and coolant leaks from intake manifold and valve cover gaskets are prevalent for both V6 options. Transmission problems, particularly harsh shifting in automatics and clutch wear in manuals, require attention. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator failure, are also reported. Exterior paint issues and interior comfort system failures, such as the HVAC blower motor, are typical for a car of this age. Regular maintenance and proactive addressing of these known issues are crucial for maintaining the CTS's reliability and driving experience.
