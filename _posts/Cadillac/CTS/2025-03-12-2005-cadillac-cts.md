The 2005 Cadillac CTS is a mid-size luxury sedan that offered a blend of style and performance. Engine options included a 2.8L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 producing 255 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque, and a high-performance 5.7L LS6 V8 (in the CTS-V) producing 400 horsepower and 395 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were either a 5-speed manual, 5-speed automatic, or a 6-speed manual. People generally liked the CTS for its sharp styling, sporty handling, and available power. Common complaints included issues with reliability, interior quality, and some quirky electronic features.

**Summary:**

The 2005 Cadillac CTS, while stylish and sporty, is prone to several issues, particularly with its engine, transmission, and electrical systems. The timing chain problems in the V6 engines and torque converter issues in the automatic transmission can be costly to repair. Electrical glitches, such as instrument panel and Passlock system failures, can also be frustrating. The sunroof is also prone to failure. While some issues may be minor, others can be quite expensive, potentially making ownership of a 2005 CTS more costly than some other vehicles in its class.
