The 2014 Cadillac CTS represents the third generation of the luxury sedan, known for its blend of performance, style, and technology. The base engine is a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 272 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 3.6L V6 generating 321 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a high-performance 3.6L Twin Turbo V6 generating 420 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque in the CTS V-Sport. All engine options are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the V-Sport pairs the 3.6L Twin Turbo V6 with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the CTS's sharp handling, comfortable interior, and attractive design. However, some criticisms include a somewhat cramped rear seat, infotainment system quirks, and occasional reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2014 Cadillac CTS, while offering a compelling blend of luxury and performance, exhibits several common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly timing chain wear in the 3.6L V6 and turbocharger issues in both the 2.0T and 3.6TT, can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, especially with the 8-speed automatic in the V-Sport, can also impact reliability and driving experience. Electrical problems with the CUE infotainment system are also frequently reported. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls. While not all CTS models will experience these issues, awareness and proper pre-purchase inspection are crucial.
