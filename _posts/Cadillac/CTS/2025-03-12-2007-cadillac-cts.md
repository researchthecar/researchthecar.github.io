The 2007 Cadillac CTS marked a significant redesign, offering a more contemporary and sporty driving experience compared to its predecessor. The available engine options included a 2.8L V6 (210 hp, 195 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (255 hp, 252 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.6L V6 VVT DI (304 hp, 273 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic, and a 6-speed automatic depending on the engine choice. Owners typically praise the CTS for its sharp styling, comfortable ride, and available features. Common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly electrical problems and some engine-related concerns, as well as lower than expected fuel economy for some engine choices.

**Summary**

The 2007 Cadillac CTS has a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine and transmission issues, particularly timing chain problems on the V6 engines and torque converter issues on the 6-speed automatic, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, especially with the navigation/radio system, are also a common complaint. While the CTS offers a stylish and comfortable ride, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor repair costs into their purchasing decision. While a well-maintained model can provide a rewarding ownership experience, neglecting these potential issues can lead to significant expenses.
