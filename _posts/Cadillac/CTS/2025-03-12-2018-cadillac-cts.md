The 2018 Cadillac CTS is a luxury sedan offering a blend of performance and comfort. It was available with several engine options, including a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 268 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 producing 335 horsepower and 285 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Twin-Turbo V6 producing 420 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque. All trims (except the V) are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The CTS is generally praised for its sharp handling, comfortable ride, and stylish interior. Common criticisms include the somewhat cramped rear seats, the CUE infotainment system can be laggy, and that some drivers feel the styling is starting to show its age.
