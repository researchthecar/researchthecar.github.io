The 2016 Cadillac CTS is a luxury sedan offering a blend of performance and comfort. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbocharged I4 producing 268 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 3.6L V6 generating 335 horsepower and 285 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.2L Supercharged V8 (CTS-V) delivering 640 horsepower and 630 lb-ft of torque. The transmissions are either an 8-speed automatic (most models) or a 6-speed manual (CTS-V). Owners often appreciate the CTS's sharp handling, stylish design, and comfortable interior. Common dislikes include the sometimes-unintuitive CUE infotainment system, some reported reliability concerns, and a smaller back seat compared to some competitors.

**Summary:**

The 2016 Cadillac CTS exhibits a range of potential issues, varying in severity and cost. Engine problems, particularly timing chain issues on the V6 and turbocharger failures on the I4, can be costly. Transmission issues such as harsh shifting are also common. Electrical problems, mainly related to the CUE system, can be frustrating. Suspension issues with the MRC system can affect ride quality and require expensive shock replacements. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to address, others can result in significant repair bills. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a pre-purchase inspection.
