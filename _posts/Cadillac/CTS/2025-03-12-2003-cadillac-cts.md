The 2003 Cadillac CTS marked Cadillac's attempt to capture a younger audience with a sporty, European-inspired sedan. Available engine options included a 3.2L V6 (220 hp, 220 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (later in the model year), and eventually a 5.7L V8 in the CTS-V. Transmissions included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the CTS's sharp handling, distinctive styling, and relatively affordable price point compared to European competitors. Common complaints centered around build quality issues, some reliability concerns, and interior materials that didn't always match the luxury aspirations of the brand.
