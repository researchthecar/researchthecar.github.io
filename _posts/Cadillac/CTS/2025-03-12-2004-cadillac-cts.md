The 2004 Cadillac CTS was a significant vehicle for Cadillac, marking a shift towards a more modern and sporty image. It was available with several engine options, including a 2.6L V6 (210 hp, 194 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (255 hp, 252 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.7L LS6 V8 (400 hp, 395 lb-ft of torque) in the CTS-V. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual (CTS-V only), and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally liked the CTS for its sharp handling, distinctive styling, and powerful engine options (especially the CTS-V). Common dislikes included some interior material quality issues, and some electrical quirks.
