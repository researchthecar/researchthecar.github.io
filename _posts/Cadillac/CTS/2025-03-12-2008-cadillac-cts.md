The 2008 Cadillac CTS was a significant redesign for the model, offering a more refined and modern take on Cadillac's luxury sedan. The 2008 CTS was available with three engine options: a 3.6L Direct Injection V6 (258 hp, 252 lb-ft torque), a 3.6L High Feature V6 (304 hp, 273 lb-ft torque), and a 2.8L High Feature V6 (210 hp, 194 lb-ft of torque). The transmissions available were either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the CTS for its sharp styling, comfortable ride, and available technology. However, some criticisms included the sometimes-harsh ride on rough roads, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.8L High Feature V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the timing chain can cause rough running, check engine light with codes related to timing, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L High Feature V6 (LY7 - Non-Direct Injection)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.8L, premature timing chain wear leads to rough running, check engine light, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Direct Injection V6 (LLT)**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine is particularly prone to timing chain issues due to the direct injection system potentially contributing to carbon buildup. Symptoms are the same as the non-direct injection engines.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    * Description/Symptoms: The direct injection engine may cause carbon buildup on the intake valves leading to loss of performance, rough idle, and misfires.
    * Solution: Cleaning of the intake valves using a walnut blasting procedure or chemical cleaner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found
