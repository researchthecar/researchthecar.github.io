### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Cadillac Escalade EXT offers a blend of luxury and utility, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 6.0L V8 engine is generally robust, though intake manifold and oil cooler line leaks can occur. The 4L60-E transmission, while common, can develop torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components, particularly with the optional Magnetic Ride Control, and various electrical systems like the BCM and HVAC controls are areas where owners may face repairs. Exterior and interior components like tailgate actuators and power seat motors can also require attention. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to managing the long-term reliability of this vehicle.
