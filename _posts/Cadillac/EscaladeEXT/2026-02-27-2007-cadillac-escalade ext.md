### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Cadillac Escalade EXT, while offering a luxurious and powerful experience, presents a few key areas of concern for owners. The 6.2L V8 engine can be prone to issues related to its Active Fuel Management system and oil consumption. The 6-speed automatic transmission may experience torque converter shudder or harsh shifting. Suspension components, particularly the Magnetic Ride Control system, can develop leaks.
