The 2012 Cadillac Escalade EXT is a luxury pickup truck that blends the utility of a truck with Cadillac's signature comfort and style. It was only offered with a single engine and transmission option: a 6.2L V8 producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (Hydra-Matic 6L80). Owners generally appreciate the Escalade EXT's powerful engine, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior. However, some common complaints include its poor fuel economy, large size making it difficult to maneuver, and relatively high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8 (L94)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, rough idle, misfires, and potentially a check engine light. Often caused by faulty lifters associated with the AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and chosen repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust can be an indicator. Often related to the AFM system and potential piston ring issues.
    * Solution: Depending on the severity, options range from using a heavier weight oil to replacing piston rings or the entire engine. Disabling the AFM system can also help reduce oil consumption in some cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (for oil change and monitoring) to $5,000+ (for engine rebuild).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Hydra-Matic 6L80 (6-speed automatic)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shaking or vibration at low speeds, especially when the transmission is in lockup. Often occurs between 30-45 mph.
    *   Solution: Flushing the transmission fluid with a fluid specifically formulated to address torque converter shudder (such as a shudder fix additive) or replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush and additive) to $800-$1500+ (torque converter replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, and potential transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low or contaminated transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal damage. Replacing the valve body or rebuilding/replacing the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) to $3,000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, ride height adjustments not functioning, and potential warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough ride, excessive bouncing, and potential air leaks from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected air struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per strut/shock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, and potential loss of functionality.
    *   Solution: Software update (if available), or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) to $500 - $1,500+ (head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery dies overnight or after a short period of inactivity. Possible causes include a parasitic draw from a faulty module, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw, or replacing the battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (battery replacement) to $100 - $500+ (diagnosing and repairing parasitic draw).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, often due to sun exposure and temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (dashboard cover) to $1,000+ (dashboard replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Heated/Cooled Seat Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The heated or cooled seats not working properly, or only working intermittently. Often related to a faulty heating/cooling element or control module.
    * Solution: Replacing the heating/cooling element or control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per seat.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Cadillac Escalade EXT has some common issues, primarily related to the engine (AFM lifter failure, oil consumption), transmission (torque converter shudder, harsh shifting), and suspension (air suspension issues). Electrical and interior problems are less prevalent but can still occur. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (torque converter shudder fix with fluid change) to more serious and costly (engine or transmission rebuild/replacement). Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance and repair costs when considering purchasing a 2012 Escalade EXT.
