The 2011 Cadillac Escalade EXT is a luxury pickup truck that blends Cadillac's signature styling with truck functionality. It came equipped with a single engine option, the 6.2L V8, producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Escalade EXT's spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and towing capacity. However, common criticisms include its poor fuel economy and high price of entry.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idling, and potential engine damage due to lifter failure caused by the AFM system. The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but it can lead to increased wear and tear on the affected cylinders.
    * Solution: Disable the AFM system with an aftermarket tuner or install an AFM disabler. In severe cases, replacing the lifters and potentially the camshaft may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for AFM disabler; $2,000 - $4,000+ for lifter/camshaft replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic or inaccurate oil pressure readings on the dashboard gauge. The oil pressure sensor itself can fail, leading to false warnings.
    * Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibrating sensation, especially at lower speeds or during light acceleration. This is often caused by deterioration of the transmission fluid or wear within the torque converter.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, ensuring that the correct fluid type is used. If the shudder persists, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush; $800 - $1,500 for torque converter replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts between gears. This can be due to issues with the valve body, solenoids, or worn internal components.
    * Solution: Diagnose the root cause, which may involve inspecting the valve body, testing solenoids, or checking for internal wear. Depending on the issue, repairs may range from replacing solenoids to a full transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 for solenoid replacement; $2,500 - $4,500 for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, rough ride, and error messages related to the air suspension system. The air compressor that maintains the proper ride height can fail.
    * Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Air Suspension Ride Height Sensor Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, the system gets stuck in a fixed height position, rough ride, and error messages related to the air suspension system. The ride height sensors that tell the compressor what height to adjust to can fail.
    * Solution: Replace the air ride height sensor(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per sensor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Navigation/Radio Screen Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation/radio screen may become unresponsive, glitchy, or completely fail.
    * Solution: Replacing the head unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door locks that fail to lock or unlock properly, or make unusual noises.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350 per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing on the dashboard surface due to sun exposure and temperature changes.
    * Solution: While there's no permanent fix, dashboard covers or replacement are possible solutions.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for a dashboard cover; $1,000+ for dashboard replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Seat Heater Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters stop working due to a break in the heating element or a faulty control module.
    * Solution: Replacing the heating element or the control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Cadillac Escalade EXT can suffer from a range of issues, from moderate electrical problems to more significant concerns with the engine and transmission. The AFM system issues within the 6.2L engine and the 6L80 transmission's torque converter problems appear to be some of the most prevalent and potentially costly concerns. Electrical gremlins, such as issues with the navigation screen and door lock actuators, are also relatively common. While the Escalade EXT provides a luxurious experience, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls.
