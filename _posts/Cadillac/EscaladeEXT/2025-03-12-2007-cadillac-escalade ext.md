The 2007 Cadillac Escalade EXT is a luxury sport utility truck known for its distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. It offered a blend of Cadillac luxury with the utility of a pickup bed. This model year came standard with a 6.2L V8 engine producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the bold styling, spacious cabin, and towing capability. Dislikes often centered around fuel economy, overall size making it difficult to maneuver, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs. Owners report burning through a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to fouled spark plugs and catalytic converter damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause is crucial. Potential causes include worn valve stem seals, piston rings, or issues within the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system. Repair can range from replacing valve stem seals or piston rings, to disabling AFM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the cause and extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **AFM (Active Fuel Management) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise, rough idle, misfires, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners choose to delete the AFM system altogether to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting, particularly between gears. Slipping during acceleration can also occur. These issues can be caused by worn clutches, valve body problems, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis is needed. Valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid/filter) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Ride Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension system is prone to failure. Symptoms include the rear of the vehicle sagging, a constantly running air compressor, or the "Service Ride Control" message appearing on the dash. The air compressor, air struts, and height sensors are common points of failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnose which component has failed (compressor, struts, height sensors). Replacement is the typical solution. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional coil-spring suspension to eliminate future air suspension issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ per component replaced, $500-$2000+ for coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not driven for a few days. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw by systematically testing circuits. Common culprits include the OnStar module, radio, or other aftermarket accessories. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster may experience intermittent failures, such as gauges not working properly or the entire cluster going blank.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster. In some cases, a simple reprogramming may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate struts may fail, causing the liftgate to not open or close properly, or to fall down unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuators may fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Cadillac Escalade EXT, while a luxurious and capable vehicle, has several common issues. Engine problems, particularly related to oil consumption and AFM lifter failure, are among the most concerning due to their potential cost. Suspension and electrical issues are also prevalent. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or extensive engine repairs, can be costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify potential problems before purchase.
