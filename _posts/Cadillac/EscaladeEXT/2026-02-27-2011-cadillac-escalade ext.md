### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Cadillac Escalade EXT, powered by its potent 6.2L V8, offers a commanding presence. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as Active Fuel Management (AFM) lifter problems and oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. The 6-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit torque converter shudder or harsh shifting. While the standard chassis is generally robust, the premium Magnetic Ride Control suspension can develop leaks in its struts.
