The 2009 Cadillac Escalade EXT is a luxury pickup truck known for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. It was available with a single engine option: a 6.2L V8 producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. It has the 6L80 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Escalade EXT's spacious cabin, towing capability, and premium features. However, some common complaints include its large size, fuel economy, and potential for costly repairs.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be due to worn valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. In some cases, a full engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts, especially on the driver's side. This leads to exhaust leaks, a ticking noise, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts. This can be a difficult job, as the bolts are often seized and can break off in the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at low speeds, particularly during light acceleration. This is often caused by a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, or the transmission slipping out of gear. This can be due to worn internal components, low fluid level, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: Transmission flush and filter change, valve body replacement, or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension sagging or not maintaining proper ride height. This is often caused by a failing air compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same symptoms as compressor failure, can also be caused by leaks in the air lines or air springs.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing leaking air lines or air springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per air spring or line.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Autoride Shocks Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bumpy ride and loss of damping. These are electronically controlled shocks so failure will also throw a dash light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Autoride shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery draining overnight or after a short period of time. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve disconnecting fuses and relays one at a time to isolate the offending circuit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation or infotainment system malfunctioning, freezing, or not responding to inputs. This can be caused by software glitches or hardware failures.
    *   Solution: Updating the software, replacing the head unit, or repairing faulty wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
