### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Cadillac Escalade EXT, powered by its 6.2L V8 engine, is a capable luxury truck. Key reliability concerns tend to center around the Active Fuel Management system's potential for oil consumption and internal wear, as well as issues with the torque converter in the 6-speed automatic transmission. The advanced Magnetic Ride Control suspension, while offering a superior ride, can be costly to repair if struts fail. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or infotainment system, are also noted. Interior climate control blend door actuators are a common, though relatively inexpensive, repair. Overall, while not immune to problems, many of these issues are addressable with proper diagnosis and repair.
