The 2008 Cadillac Escalade EXT is a luxury pickup truck known for its bold styling, spacious interior, and powerful engine. The sole engine option for this model year is a 6.2L Vortec V8 producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6L80E six-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Escalade EXT's towing capacity, comfortable ride, and high-end features. Common dislikes include its large size, poor fuel economy, and potential for expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**6.2L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to premature lifter failure. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, rough running, and potential damage to the camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft is often required. Some owners choose to disable the AFM system to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some 6.2L engines experience excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential catalytic converter damage.
    * Solution: A common fix is to replace the valve seals. In more severe cases, piston rings may need replacement.

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts can occur, sometimes accompanied by slipping between gears. This may be due to worn valve body components or damaged clutch packs.
