### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Cadillac Escalade EXT, while offering a luxurious and capable package, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for vehicles of its age and platform. The 6.0L Vortec V8 is generally robust, but intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines can develop leaks. The 4L60-E transmission, while common, can suffer from torque converter issues and overheating if not maintained. Suspension components, particularly the air suspension system, and electrical gremlins related to the BCM are also notable. Rust can be a significant issue depending on climate. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs for a vehicle of this vintage.
