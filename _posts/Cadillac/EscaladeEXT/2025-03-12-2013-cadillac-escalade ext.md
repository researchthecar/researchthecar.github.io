The 2013 Cadillac Escalade EXT is a luxury pickup truck known for its powerful engine, comfortable ride, and upscale features. It offers a blend of truck utility and Cadillac luxury. People generally appreciate its bold styling, spacious interior, and towing capacity. Some common complaints include its large size making it difficult to maneuver, relatively poor fuel economy, and the high cost of maintenance and repairs. The 2013 Escalade EXT comes standard with a 6.2L V8 engine producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. No other engine or transmission options were available for the 2013 Escalade EXT.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the valve cover with an updated design can help reduce oil consumption. In more severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. The lifters on these cylinders can fail, causing a ticking noise, misfires, and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty AFM lifters. Some owners choose to disable AFM altogether and replace the lifters with standard lifters to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6L80 transmission can exhibit harsh or erratic shifting, especially between certain gears. Slipping during acceleration may also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. More serious problems may require valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Escalade EXT is equipped with an air suspension system that can experience issues with the air compressor, air springs (bags), or height sensors. This can lead to a saggy or uneven ride height, a rough ride, or the air compressor running constantly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air compressor, air springs, or height sensors as needed. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension for increased reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per component, $1500 - $3000+ for coil spring conversion
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Shock Absorber Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Magnetic Ride Control suspension uses special shock absorbers filled with a magnetorheological fluid. These shocks can leak or fail, resulting in a bouncy or uncontrolled ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty MRC shock absorbers. These shocks are more expensive than traditional shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can be caused by parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing and replacing faulty modules, sensors, or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation and infotainment system can experience various issues, such as freezing, Crashing, or the screen flickering.
    *   Solution: Performing a hard reset of the system, or replacing the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The tailgate latch may malfunction, causing the tailgate to be difficult to open or close.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty tailgate latch or handle assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard may develop cracks, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or installing a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Heated/Cooled Seat Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Heated and cooled seat features do not function properly.
    * Solution: Replacing the heating and cooling elements of the seat, or the seat control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$800
    * Recalls: None Found
