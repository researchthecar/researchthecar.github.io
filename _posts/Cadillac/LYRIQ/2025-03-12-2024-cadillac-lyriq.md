**Battery/Charging System**

*   **Inconsistent Charging Speeds/Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the LYRIQ not consistently achieving the expected charging speeds, especially at public fast-charging stations. There are also reports of difficulty initiating a charging session or the charging session unexpectedly stopping. Some have also reported the charger port door freezing shut during colder months.
    *   Solution: Software updates are being rolled out to address communication issues between the vehicle and charging stations. Ensure the charging station is compatible with CCS. If that does not work, the charging port and charging system needs to be inspected by a Cadillac technician to determine if the cause is a defective component. For the charging port freezing, a plastic cover can be installed to prevent ice from getting into the door, or a small amount of lubricant can be applied.

*   **Reduced Range/Battery Degradation Concerns**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a noticeable reduction in range, especially in colder weather or after prolonged use. This is related to the expected drop off in range during cold weather and battery degradation over time.
    *   Solution: The range in cold weather can be mitigated by pre-conditioning the battery prior to driving. There is no simple solution to combatting battery degradation over time. Replacing the battery pack will restore original range capabilities.
