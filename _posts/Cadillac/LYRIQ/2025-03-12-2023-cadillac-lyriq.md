**Electric Motor**

**Rear-Wheel Drive Single Motor**

*   **Reduced Propulsion Power/Loss of Power**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the vehicle displaying a "Reduced Propulsion Power" message, sometimes accompanied by a complete loss of power while driving. This issue can occur intermittently and without warning.
    *   Solution: The fix often involves a software update to the vehicle's battery management system (BMS) and/or drive motor control module. In some cases, a faulty battery module or motor controller replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. Hardware replacements can range from $1,000 to $5,000+ depending on the specific part.

**All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor**

*   **Front Motor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some AWD LYRIQ owners have reported issues specifically with the front electric motor. Symptoms can include unusual noises (whining, clicking), reduced power output, or the AWD system disengaging, resulting in the vehicle operating in RWD only.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis typically involves checking the motor's wiring, connections, and internal components. Replacement of the front motor assembly may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ (motor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Reduced Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained about the actual range of the vehicle being significantly lower than the advertised range, especially in cold weather or during highway driving.
    *   Solution: While some reduction in range is normal under adverse conditions, excessive range loss may indicate a problem with the battery management system or individual battery modules. Software recalibration of the BMS and individual module replacement have been reported solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. Battery module replacement can be costly, ranging from $500 - $2,000+ per module.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional reports of difficulty initiating or completing charging sessions, either at home or at public charging stations. This can include error messages, slow charging speeds, or the charge stopping unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: The charging port and the onboard charger should be inspected for damage and proper function. Inspect the 12V battery. In some cases, a software update to the charging system may be required. Replacement of the onboard charger or the charging port might be necessary in some instances.
