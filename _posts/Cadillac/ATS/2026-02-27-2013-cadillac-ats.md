### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Cadillac ATS generally presents a solid reliability record for its class and year, particularly with the naturally aspirated 2.5L engine and manual transmission. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the 2.0L turbo engine's potential for turbocharger problems and oil leaks, and the 3.6L V6's timing chain concerns. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the CUE infotainment system's responsiveness and occasional battery drain, are also noted. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential areas and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections, especially for models with the turbocharged engine or automatic transmission.
