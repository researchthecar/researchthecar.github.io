Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2017 Cadillac ATS, organized by category and specific powertrain configurations.

The 2017 Cadillac ATS is a compact luxury sedan known for its sharp handling and available performance features. It came with a choice of three engines: a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (272 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque), a 3.6L V6 (335 hp, 285 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (272 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque) in the ATS Coupe model. Transmission options included an 8-speed automatic, and a 6-speed manual was available on some trims. People generally liked the ATS for its sporty driving dynamics, stylish design, and comfortable interior. However, some disliked the somewhat cramped rear seating, the infotainment system, and reliability concerns.
