### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Cadillac ATS offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with its reliability generally being good. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the powertrain, particularly the 2.0L turbo engine's turbocharger and potential coolant leaks, and the 8-speed automatic transmission's occasional hesitation. Electrical gremlins, especially with the CUE infotainment system and intermittent battery drain, are also noted concerns. However, the chassis, suspension (even with Magnetic Ride Control), exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread problems. With proper maintenance and attention to these specific potential issues, the 2017 ATS can be a reliable and enjoyable luxury vehicle.
