The 2013 Cadillac ATS was the first model year of the ATS, a compact luxury sedan aimed at competing with European rivals like the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4. The ATS offered a blend of style, handling, and technology. Powertrain options included a 2.5L inline-4 producing 202 horsepower and 191 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 272 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 321 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 6-speed manual (available only with the 2.0T) or a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally praised the ATS for its sharp handling, attractive styling, and comfortable interior. Criticisms often focused on the somewhat cramped rear seat, and some concerns about the CUE infotainment system.
