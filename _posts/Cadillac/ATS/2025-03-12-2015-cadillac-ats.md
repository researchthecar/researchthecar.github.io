The 2015 Cadillac ATS is a compact luxury sedan that aimed to deliver a sporty driving experience. It was offered with three engine choices: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 202 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 making 272 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 generating 321 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque.

**Summary**

The 2015 Cadillac ATS has some known issues, with the CUE infotainment system and engine/transmission related problems being the most common and potentially costly to address. The 2.0T engine is susceptible to turbo and HPFP failures, and the 3.6L V6 can suffer from timing chain issues. Transmission problems, especially harsh shifting, are also reported. Suspension issues with the Magnetic Ride Control can be expensive to fix. While many of these issues aren't universal, potential buyers should be aware of them and factor them into their purchasing decision.
