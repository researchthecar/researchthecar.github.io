### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Cadillac ATS generally presents a solid reliability record, particularly with its naturally aspirated 2.5L engine and manual transmission. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the turbocharged 2.0L engine's turbocharger and oil leaks, as well as the 3.6L V6's timing chain. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the CUE infotainment system's responsiveness and occasional battery drain, are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most common technical concerns reported for this model year, suggesting that thorough pre-purchase inspections and attentive maintenance are advisable.
