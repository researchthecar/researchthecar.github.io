The 2008 Cadillac XLR is a luxury roadster that offers a blend of style and performance. It was only offered with one engine option: a 4.6L Northstar V8 producing 320 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The XLR is praised for its unique retractable hardtop, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior, but it has also received criticism for its relatively small trunk space, less sporty handling compared to rivals, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often stemming from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, the smell of burning oil, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Northstar engine is known for potential issues with the cooling system, including coolant leaks from the water pump, radiator, or hoses. Overheating can occur if these leaks are not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty water pump, radiator, or hoses. Regular coolant flushes and inspections are recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6L80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifting, especially between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating can also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid/filter), $500 - $1500+ (valve body), $2500 - $5000+ (rebuild/replacement).

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The XLR is equipped with Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) for enhanced ride quality. Problems can arise with the MRC shocks, leading to a loss of damping, a bouncy ride, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty MRC shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per shock.

**Summary**

The 2008 Cadillac XLR presents a mixed bag. While offering luxury and unique styling, it is susceptible to several common issues. Engine oil leaks and cooling system problems, particularly within the Northstar V8, can be costly to address. The retractable hardtop and Magnetic Ride Control, while desirable features, are also potential sources of expensive repairs. Electrical glitches and interior component failures add to the ownership considerations. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in repair costs when considering purchasing a 2008 Cadillac XLR. Due to the age of the vehicle, it is also important to note that the cost of certain repairs may be inflated due to the relative scarcity of available parts.
