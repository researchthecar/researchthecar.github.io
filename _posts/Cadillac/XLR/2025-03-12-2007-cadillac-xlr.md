The 2007 Cadillac XLR is a luxury roadster known for its retractable hardtop and distinctive styling. It came standard with a 4.6L Northstar V8 engine producing 320 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission option was a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the XLR's unique design, comfortable ride, and luxurious features. Some common complaints include electrical issues, problems with the retractable hardtop, and higher-than-average maintenance costs compared to other vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.6L Northstar V8**

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience rough idling, stalling, reduced power, or a check engine light. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to camshaft position sensors (e.g., P0340, P0341) may be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various areas, including valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil pan gasket. The leaks can lead to oil consumption and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ (depending on the location of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating can occur due to coolant leaks, radiator problems, or thermostat failures. The Northstar engine is known to be sensitive to overheating.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the leaking components (hoses, radiator, water pump), replace the thermostat, and ensure proper coolant levels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the component and extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, especially at low speeds, can indicate torque converter issues. This can eventually lead to complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the torque converter. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit rough or delayed shifts, or it may slip out of gear. This can be due to worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, repair or replace the valve body, or rebuild the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and required repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Shocks Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MRC system can experience shock absorber failure, resulting in a bouncy or harsh ride. Warning lights may illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty MRC shocks. This can be an expensive repair due to the specialized nature of the components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+ per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Retractable Hardtop Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The retractable hardtop mechanism can be prone to malfunctions, including slow operation, complete failure to open or close, and error messages on the driver information center.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue (hydraulic pump, sensors, actuators, wiring) and replace or repair the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the complexity of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car may experience a rapid battery drain, especially when not driven frequently. This can be due to parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identify and eliminate the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing individual circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Panel Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument panel may experience intermittent flickering, dimming, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replace or repair the instrument panel cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Retractable Hardtop Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks can occur around the retractable hardtop seals, particularly in heavy rain.
    *   Solution: Replace or adjust the seals around the hardtop.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the extent of the leak and the seals that need to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system may experience software glitches, map inaccuracies, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Update the navigation system software or replace the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises from behind the dashboard, uneven temperature distribution, or inability to control airflow can indicate a failed HVAC actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty HVAC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the location of the actuator)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Cadillac XLR can be a rewarding car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the engine, transmission, electrical system, and retractable hardtop. The magnetic ride control suspension and retractable hardtop systems can be particularly expensive to repair. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite costly to fix, requiring careful inspection and potentially extensive repairs.
