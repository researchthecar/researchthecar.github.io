The 2004 Cadillac XLR was a luxury roadster that combined Cadillac's signature styling with a sporty driving experience. It was offered with a single engine option, the 4.6L Northstar V8, producing 320 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 5L40-E 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the XLR's unique retractable hardtop, comfortable ride, and luxurious features. Some common complaints included the car's complex electronics, occasional reliability issues, and relatively small trunk space when the top was down.

**Summary**

The 2004 Cadillac XLR, while stylish and luxurious, can present owners with several potential issues, particularly as the car ages. The most concerning issues relate to the complex retractable hardtop, potential cooling system problems with the Northstar V8, and the Magnetic Ride Control suspension. Electrical gremlins can also be a headache. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as a transmission rebuild or hardtop repair, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with the XLR to identify any potential problems.
