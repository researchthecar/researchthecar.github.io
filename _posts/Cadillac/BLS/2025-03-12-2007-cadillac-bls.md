Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2007 Cadillac BLS, structured according to your specifications.

The 2007 Cadillac BLS was a compact executive car primarily sold in Europe, not in North America. It offered a blend of Cadillac styling and Saab engineering, as it was based on the Saab 9-3 platform. Engine options included several gasoline engines and a diesel engine. The gasoline engine options include a 2.0L Turbo I4 engine producing around 175 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L High Output Turbo I4 with around 210 hp and 221 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Turbo V6 with around 255 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. The diesel option was a 1.9L Turbo Diesel I4 with varying outputs depending on the specific version. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed automatic. People liked the BLS for its distinctive Cadillac styling in a smaller package and its comfortable ride. Common dislikes included the Saab-based interior feeling out of place in a Cadillac, reliability concerns, and the fact that it wasn't sold in North America.
