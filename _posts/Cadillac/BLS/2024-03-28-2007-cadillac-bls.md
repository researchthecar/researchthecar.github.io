**Introduction:**

The 2007 Cadillac BLS was a compact luxury sedan based on the Saab 9-3. It was available with a 2.0T turbocharged inline-four engine paired with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission. The BLS received praise for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and responsive handling, but it faced criticism for its lack of power and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0T Turbocharged Inline-Four**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** Turbochargers can fail prematurely, resulting in reduced power, smoke, and oil leaks. The turbocharger and associated parts need to be replaced. $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Coolant Leak:** Coolant leaks can develop in the coolant hoses or the radiator. Symptoms include overheating and low coolant levels. The faulty component needs to be replaced. $300 - $1,000+
* **Oil Leak:** Oil leaks can occur from the oil pan gasket, valve cover gasket, or other seals. The leaking part needs to be replaced or resealed. $200 - $800+
* **Recalls:** None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Shifting Difficulty:** Some vehicles experience difficulty shifting into gears. This issue can be caused by worn shift linkage or synchronizers. The affected parts need to be replaced or repaired. $500 - $1,500+
* **Clutch Failure:** The clutch can fail prematurely, causing slipping or difficulty engaging gears. The clutch assembly needs to be replaced. $800 - $1,800+
* **No Issues Found**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Control Module Failure:** The transmission control module (TCM) can fail, leading to transmission problems such as shifting delays or erratic behavior. The TCM needs to be replaced. $500 - $1,000+
* **Solenoid Failure:** Faulty solenoids can affect transmission operation, causing shifting issues or loss of power. The solenoids need to be replaced. $300 - $800+
* **Recalls:** None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushings:** The front control arm bushings can wear out prematurely, causing clunking or squeaking noises. The bushings need to be replaced. $400 - $800+
* **Rear Shock Absorbers:** The rear shock absorbers can fail, resulting in a rough ride and poor handling. The shock absorbers need to be replaced. $500 - $1,200+
* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Electrical System Malfunction:** The electrical system can experience intermittent malfunctions, such as power loss or flickering lights. Diagnostics are needed to identify the source of the issue and make repairs. $200 - $1,000+
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely, especially after sitting for a period of time. This can be caused by a faulty alternator or a parasitic draw. The alternator or other components need to be tested and replaced if necessary. $500 - $1,500+
* **Radio Failure:** The radio can malfunction or become unresponsive. The radio unit may need to be replaced. $300 - $800+
* **HVAC Issues:** The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system can experience problems, such as inoperative fans or climate control malfunctions. The affected components need to be diagnosed and replaced or repaired. $300 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Fog Light Failure:** The fog lights can fail prematurely, resulting in reduced visibility. The fog lights or wiring harness need to be replaced. $200 - $500+
* **Headlight Condensation:** Condensation can build up inside the headlights, impairing visibility. The headlights need to be resealed or replaced. $100 - $400+
* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Power Window Malfunction:** The power windows can fail to operate or become inoperative. The window motor or switch may need to be replaced. $200 - $600+
* **Climate Control Panel Failure:** The climate control panel can malfunction, causing erratic temperature control or other issues. The panel or associated components need to be replaced. $500 - $1,200+
* **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2007 Cadillac BLS has several potential issues, particularly with its engine and transmission. The turbocharger, coolant system, and oil leaks are common concerns, while the transmission can experience shifting problems and electronic module failures. Maintenance and repairs can be costly, but most issues are not overly severe or widespread.
