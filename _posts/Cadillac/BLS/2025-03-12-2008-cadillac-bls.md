The 2008 Cadillac BLS, primarily sold in Europe, was Cadillac's attempt to enter the compact executive car market. It was available as a sedan and wagon (estate) and offered a range of engines including gasoline and diesel options. While not sold in the United States, it's important to address the common issues reported by owners in the markets where it was available. Specific engines included various turbocharged 2.0L gasoline engines, a 2.8L V6, and a 1.9L turbodiesel. Transmissions included manual and automatic options. Owners appreciated the BLS's distinctive Cadillac styling and comfortable interior, but common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the diesel engines and some electrical components.

**Engine**

**1.9L Turbo Diesel (Z19DTH)**

*   **Swirl Flap Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The swirl flaps inside the intake manifold can break or wear down, causing engine performance issues, reduced fuel economy, error codes, and eventually potential engine damage. The flaps control airflow into the cylinders, and when they fail, they can cause erratic engine behavior and CEL (Check Engine Light) illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold or swirl flap delete kits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, stalling, reduced power, and increased emissions.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbo Gasoline**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine, loss of power, excessive oil consumption, and potentially smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings in the rear suspension arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning central locking system, where doors may not lock or unlock correctly.

**Summary**

The 2008 Cadillac BLS, while offering a unique Cadillac experience in the compact executive segment, has its share of common issues. The 1.9L turbodiesel is particularly prone to swirl flap and EGR valve problems, which can lead to performance and reliability concerns. Electrical issues, such as central locking malfunctions and CIM failures, also contribute to the car's reputation for requiring maintenance. Rust and pixel loss in the instrument cluster can affect the aesthetics and functionality of the vehicle. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to significant repairs, with costs potentially ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the issue and extent of the damage.
