### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Cadillac BLS, while offering a premium feel, presents a mixed reliability profile. Diesel engines, particularly the 1.9L JTDm, are susceptible to DPF and EGR issues, common in many modern diesels. Petrol engines, especially the turbocharged variants, can experience turbocharger wear and oil leaks. Automatic transmissions may develop issues with gear engagement over time. Suspension components like bushings can wear, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and infotainment glitches, are also noted. While not plagued by catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential issues and budget for their repair. Regular maintenance, especially for diesel emissions systems, is crucial.
