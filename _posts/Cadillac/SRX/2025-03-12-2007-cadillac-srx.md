The 2007 Cadillac SRX is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV that offered a blend of comfort, style, and performance. It came with three engine options: a 3.6L V6 producing 255 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, a 4.6L Northstar V8 producing 320 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.4L Supercharged Northstar V8 producing 469 horsepower and 439 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic for the V6 and a 6-speed automatic for the V8s. Owners often praised the SRX for its smooth ride, spacious interior, and attractive styling. Common complaints included issues with the complicated electronics, higher-than-average repair costs, and somewhat lackluster fuel economy, especially with the V8 engines.

**Summary:** The 2007 Cadillac SRX, while offering a luxurious driving experience, is prone to several issues. The engine problems, particularly with the Northstar V8s (oil leaks and head bolt issues), can be quite costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as those affecting the infotainment and Stabilitrak systems, are also common complaints. While some issues, like blend door actuator failure, are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as timing chain replacement or supercharger repairs, can be significant financial burdens. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic. The severity ranges from minor electrical glitches to major engine overhauls, with repair costs potentially ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, making thorough due diligence essential.
