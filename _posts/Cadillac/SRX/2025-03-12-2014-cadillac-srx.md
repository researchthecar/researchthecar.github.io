The 2014 Cadillac SRX is a luxury crossover SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and a good balance of features. Engine options included a 3.6L V6 engine producing 308 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the SRX's spacious interior, attractive styling, and available technology. Common dislikes include fuel economy that isn't class-leading and some complaints about the CUE infotainment system.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit a rattling noise upon startup, especially after sitting for extended periods. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to timing chain correlation (P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018). This is due to wear on the timing chain guides and/or the timing chain itself.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chains, chain guides, tensioners, and potentially camshaft phasers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, long cranking times, misfires, or stalling. Check Engine Light will often be illuminated. Diagnostic codes might include those related to fuel pressure or fuel pump performance.
    * Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop or when the torque converter is supposed to be locked up. Transmission may also slip or fail to shift properly. Diagnostic codes might include codes related to torque converter clutch performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary if the torque converter failure has caused damage to other internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,500+ (depending on whether just the torque converter is replaced or the entire transmission needs work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wave Plate Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, especially between 3rd and 5th gears. Transmission may slip or fail to shift at all. Error codes may include those related to incorrect gear ratio.
    * Solution: Transmission disassembly, inspection, and replacement of the broken wave plate. A full transmission rebuild is often recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure (Especially with Magnetic Ride Control)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, and potential instability, particularly when cornering or braking. A knocking or clunking noise from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers. If equipped with Magnetic Ride Control, these shocks are significantly more expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (per shock for standard shocks), $800 - $1500+ (per shock for Magnetic Ride Control shocks)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **CUE Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unresponsive touchscreen, freezing, random reboots, delamination of the touchscreen surface, and loss of functionality for various features (navigation, audio, climate control).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CUE touchscreen module or the entire CUE unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on whether just the touchscreen is replaced or the entire unit).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not in use for extended periods. Difficult to start the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may leak, make excessive noise when opening or closing, or fail to open or close completely. This is often due to issues with the sunroof motor, track, or seals.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, track components, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close automatically, or it may only open or close partially. This is often due to issues with the liftgate struts, motor, or latch.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the liftgate struts, motor, or latch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2014 Cadillac SRX has some notable issues, primarily revolving around the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Timing chain issues on the 3.6L V6 can be expensive, and torque converter problems with the 6-speed automatic transmission are also a concern. The CUE infotainment system is a common source of frustration due to its reliability issues. While some repairs are relatively minor, others, like engine or transmission work, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
