The 2010 Cadillac SRX marked a significant redesign for the model, moving from a rear-wheel-drive-based platform to a front-wheel-drive architecture. It offered two engine choices: a 3.0L direct-injected V6 producing 265 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L turbocharged V6 generating 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the SRX for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and available technology. Common criticisms included the sometimes sluggish performance of the base engine, cramped rear seating, and complex infotainment system.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Stalling, rough running engine, long crank times. DTCs related to fuel pressure may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.8L Turbocharged V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive oil consumption, whistling or whining noises from the engine bay, and possible engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit. In some cases, oil lines may need to be cleaned or replaced as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+

    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve cover area or rear main seal, rough idling, whistling noise from the engine, and possibly a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the PCV valve, inspect the PCV hoses for blockages or damage, and check the intake manifold for leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during gear changes, especially at lower speeds. Slipping between gears, hesitation to engage, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission flush and fluid replacement might temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but replacement is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, slipping, and potential for complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some cases, individual solenoids within the valve body can be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Air Compressor Failure (if equipped)**

**Summary**

The 2010 Cadillac SRX, while offering a stylish design and comfortable ride, presents several potential issues for owners. The timing chain problems in the 3.0L V6 and turbocharger failures in the 2.8L V6 can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and valve body, are also a concern. Electrical problems with the CUE system and battery drain can be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in the potential for higher repair costs when considering this model. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences like CUE system glitches to major engine and transmission failures. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor electrical issues to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission replacements.
