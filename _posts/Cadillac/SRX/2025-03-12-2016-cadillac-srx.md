**Engine**

**3.6L V6 (LGX)**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine rattling noise, especially upon startup. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to camshaft or crankshaft correlation. The timing chain stretches over time, leading to incorrect valve timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling, difficulty starting, and a check engine light. Fuel trims may be off, and diagnostic codes related to fuel pressure are present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level, burning oil smell, blue smoke from the exhaust. Requires frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a PCV valve replacement can alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (PCV) to $5,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, especially when cold. Transmission may slip or hesitate during acceleration.
    *   Solution: A software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (reflash) to $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. Often noticeable around 40-60 mph.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush using the correct type of fluid can sometimes alleviate the issue. In some cases, torque converter replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (flush) to $800 - $1500+ (converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Creaking, clunking, or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. Often related to worn sway bar links or bushings.
