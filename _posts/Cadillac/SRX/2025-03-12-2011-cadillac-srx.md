The 2011 Cadillac SRX is a compact luxury crossover SUV that offers a blend of style and comfort. It was available with two engine options: a 3.0L V6 producing 265 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque and a 2.8L turbocharged V6 producing 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
