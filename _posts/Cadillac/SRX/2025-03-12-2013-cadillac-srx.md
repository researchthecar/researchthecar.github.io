The 2013 Cadillac SRX is a luxury crossover SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and available technology. It came with two engine options: a 3.6L V6 producing 308 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L Turbocharged V6, which was available on the Performance and Premium trim levels. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the SRX for its upscale interior, quiet cabin, and distinctive exterior styling. Common dislikes included its smaller cargo space compared to some competitors and its sometimes frustrating CUE infotainment system.
