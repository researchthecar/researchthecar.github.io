The 2012 Cadillac SRX is a luxury crossover SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and relatively spacious interior. It was offered with two engine options: a 3.0L V6 producing 265 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.6L V6 generating 308 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the SRX's upscale features, comfortable seating, and distinctive styling. Common dislikes include lower-than-average fuel economy, some complaints about the CUE infotainment system, and reports of certain mechanical issues.
