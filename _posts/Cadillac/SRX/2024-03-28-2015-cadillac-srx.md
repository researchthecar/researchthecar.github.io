**Introduction:**

The 2015 Cadillac SRX is a midsize luxury crossover SUV. It is available with a 3.0L V6 engine paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission or a 3.6L V6 engine paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0L V6 produces 265 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.6L V6 delivers 308 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. The SRX has received praise for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engines. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of handling agility and high fuel consumption.
