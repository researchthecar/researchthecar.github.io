The 2009 Cadillac SRX is a mid-size luxury SUV offering a blend of comfort and performance. Engine options included a 3.0L V6 (255 hp, 223 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.8L Turbocharged V6 (300 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque). Both engines came standard with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the SRX's stylish design and comfortable ride, but some common complaints revolve around the electrical system, engine issues (specifically the timing chain), and interior trim quality.

**Summary**

The 2009 Cadillac SRX has some notable issues, with the 3.0L V6 engine's timing chain problem being the most significant and potentially expensive to address. Turbocharger and HPFP failures on the 2.8L variant, along with transmission and air suspension problems, can also lead to costly repairs. While not all SRX models will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and budget accordingly for potential maintenance. The severity of these issues ranges from inconvenient electrical glitches to major mechanical failures. The cost of repairs can vary widely, but some problems can easily exceed $2,000, making pre-purchase inspections crucial.
