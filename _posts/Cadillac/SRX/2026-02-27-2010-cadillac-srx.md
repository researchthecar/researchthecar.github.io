### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Cadillac SRX demonstrates reasonable reliability, particularly with its standard 3.0L V6 engine and general chassis components. However, owners of models equipped with the more powerful 2.8L turbocharged V6 should be aware of potential issues related to the turbocharger and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting and leaks, are also noted, though often addressable with maintenance or specific repairs. Electrical gremlins, primarily concerning the infotainment system and power liftgate, are not uncommon. Overall, the SRX is a decent option, but careful inspection of the turbocharged engine and transmission is advised for potential buyers.
