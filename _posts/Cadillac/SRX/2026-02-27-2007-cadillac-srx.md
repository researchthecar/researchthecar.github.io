### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Cadillac SRX presents a mixed reliability profile. The V6 and V8 engines, while offering good performance, are prone to specific issues like timing chain wear and coolant leaks, respectively. The automatic transmission can also develop problems with harsh shifting or torque converter failure. Suspension components, particularly strut mounts and the optional rear air suspension, are common areas for repair. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or infotainment system, can also be a concern. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, the blend door actuator in the climate control system is a notable interior issue. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs.
