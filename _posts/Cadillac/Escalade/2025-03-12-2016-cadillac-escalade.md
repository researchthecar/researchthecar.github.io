The 2016 Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and upscale features. The standard engine is a 6.2L V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Escalade's bold styling, comfortable ride, and towing capacity. However, common complaints revolve around the infotainment system, reliability issues, and high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8 (L86)**

* **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and potential for significant engine damage. Often diagnosed with a check engine light and codes related to cylinder misfires. Can also result in lifter noise, sometimes described as ticking or knocking.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed AFM lifters, often involving removal of the cylinder head. In some cases, replacement of the entire engine may be recommended if significant damage has occurred. Installation of an AFM disabler can prevent the AFM lifters from activating.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ depending on the damage and shop.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Can lead to fouled spark plugs, catalytic converter damage, and engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to rule out leaks. Some owners have had success with piston ring replacement or valve seal replacement, although this is a major repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ depending on the repairs needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**

**Summary**

The 2016 Cadillac Escalade can be a desirable vehicle due to its features and capabilities, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues reported by owners. Engine issues, particularly AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, are also prevalent. Electrical issues with the CUE system can be frustrating. Suspension problems with the Magnetic Ride Control add to the potential maintenance burden.
