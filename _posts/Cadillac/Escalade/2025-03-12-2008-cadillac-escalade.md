The 2008 Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV known for its powerful performance, spacious interior, and bold styling. Engine options included a 6.2L V8 producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Escalade was praised for its comfortable ride and towing capacity, but some owners have reported issues with reliability and high running costs. A common complaint involves the vehicle's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, misfires, engine knocking, and potential engine damage. Can be triggered by the AFM system deactivating cylinders and allowing the non-firing cylinders to fill with oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty lifters, often with updated non-AFM lifters, and disable the AFM system with a tuner or AFM delete kit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous low oil pressure readings on the dashboard, even when oil levels are adequate. Check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at low speeds. Difficulty shifting gears. Potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, especially after sitting overnight. The air compressor running constantly or not at all. "Service Ride Control" message on the dashboard.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery dying overnight or after short periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the parasitic drain. This can involve identifying a faulty module, a short circuit, or an accessory that is not shutting off properly.
