**Engine**

**6.2L V8 (L86)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifter failure can cause misfires, rough running, and ticking noises. Typically, the problem stems from the cylinder #7 lifter.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters. Many owners opt to delete the AFM system entirely during repair to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption. This can be caused by issues with the piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, solutions range from using a thicker oil to replacing the piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10L80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. This can be caused by valve body issues or software glitches.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a software update can resolve the issue. Other times, the valve body needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (software update) - $2,000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation, particularly at low speeds and under light acceleration. This is often attributed to the torque converter clutch.
    *   Solution: A fluid flush and update to the TCM may fix the issue. Replacement of the torque converter will be required if the shuddering persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $1,500+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MRC system uses special fluid and electronically controlled dampers to provide a smooth ride. Failures can manifest as a harsh or bouncy ride, along with error messages on the dashboard. Leaking dampers are a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected MRC dampers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per damper

**Summary**

The 2018 Cadillac Escalade, while luxurious and powerful, is susceptible to some notable issues. Engine problems, particularly AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, can be very expensive to repair. Transmission issues, while less catastrophic, can still be frustrating. Electrical gremlins, especially with the CUE system, are also common. Suspension problems can be costly due to the price of MRC components. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and budget accordingly for potential repairs. The severity of the problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures.
