Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2007 Cadillac Escalade, formatted for your website.

The 2007 Cadillac Escalade represents a significant step forward in luxury SUVs, blending powerful performance with upscale amenities. The standard engine is a 6.2L Vortec V8, producing 403 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consist solely of the 6L80 six-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Escalade's spacious cabin, commanding presence, and powerful engine. Common criticisms often involve its large size making it hard to maneuver and park, the high fuel consumption, and potential reliability concerns associated with its complex systems.

**Engine**

**6.2L Vortec V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: AFM is a system that shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy. Lifter failure can cause a ticking noise, rough idling, misfires (especially on affected cylinders), and a potential check engine light. The car may run poorly or stall.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Many owners opt to disable AFM during this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the shop and extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be present.
    *   Solution: Potential causes range from worn valve stem seals and piston rings to issues related to the AFM system. A compression test and leak-down test can help pinpoint the source. The solution may require replacing the valve stem seals or piston rings, or disabling AFM if that's contributing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+, depending on the source of the leak and the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knock Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine performance, and potential knocking or pinging sounds from the engine. The vehicle may go into "limp mode".
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty knock sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 Six-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Transmission slipping can occur, where the engine revs up but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly.
    *   Solution: Could be due to low transmission fluid, a faulty valve body, or worn clutches. A transmission flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250 for fluid and filter, $500 - $1500 for valve body, $2500 - $5000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially at highway speeds under light acceleration. This is often caused by wear in the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or performing a transmission flush with a fluid that is designed to limit shudder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ for torque converter replacement, $150 - $300+ for fluid flush and additive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, a warning light on the dash, and the air compressor not running or running constantly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor. Also inspect the air springs (bags) for leaks, as a leak can cause the compressor to overwork and fail.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Spring (Air Bag) Leaks (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle sitting lower on one side or in the rear, a hissing sound coming from the suspension, and the air compressor running frequently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per air spring.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Autoride Shock Absorber Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, leaking fluid from the shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Autoride shocks. These are electronically controlled and more expensive than standard shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per shock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Radio Display Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation or radio display flickering, freezing, or failing completely.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a software update can resolve the issue. Otherwise, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update, $500 - $1,500+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks not working properly, with doors failing to lock or unlock with the remote or interior switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery draining overnight or within a few days of not being driven. This can be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for diagnosis and repair, depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate failing to open or close properly, or making unusual noises.
    * Solution: Can be caused by a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or latch. Replacing the affected component is typically the solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking in the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates, due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard (expensive) or installing a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ for replacement, $50 - $200 for a cover.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters not working, or only working intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or the seat heater control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Cadillac Escalade can present owners with a range of issues, some of which can be quite costly to repair. Engine problems, particularly related to the Active Fuel Management system and oil consumption, are a significant concern. Suspension issues, especially with the air suspension system if equipped, can also lead to expensive repairs. Electrical problems, such as display issues and battery drain, are also relatively common. While some issues are minor, others can impact the vehicle's reliability and overall ownership experience. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and be prepared for potential maintenance costs.
