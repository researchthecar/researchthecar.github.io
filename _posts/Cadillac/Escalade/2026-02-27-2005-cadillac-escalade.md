### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Cadillac Escalade offers a blend of luxury and capability, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The powerful 6.0L V8 engine is generally reliable but can suffer from intake manifold leaks and oil cooler line issues. Transmission problems, particularly with the torque converter and solenoids in the 4L60-E, are not uncommon. The advanced suspension systems (Magnetic Ride Control and rear air suspension) can be costly to repair if they fail. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior electronics like the infotainment system and heated seats may develop faults over time. Despite these potential issues, many Escalades remain on the road, often requiring diligent maintenance and occasional repairs to keep them running smoothly.
