The 2014 Cadillac Escalade is a luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and upscale features. Engine options included a 6.2L V8 engine (L86) producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque paired with a 6L80 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Escalade for its comfortable ride and towing capability. Common complaints include the large size making it difficult to park, and less than stellar fuel economy.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8 (L86)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, and potential for significant engine damage. The AFM lifters can collapse, causing the affected cylinders to stop firing.
    *   Solution: Replace all AFM lifters with updated AFM lifters or convert to non-AFM lifters. Replacing the VLOM (Valve Lifter Oil Manifold) is often recommended as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption requiring frequent topping off of oil levels. May be caused by faulty PCV valve, piston rings, or valve seals.
    *   Solution: Repair will depend on the root cause and may range from PCV valve replacement, to replacing piston rings and valve seals or replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6L80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially at low speeds during light acceleration or while maintaining a steady speed in higher gears. Often felt between 30-50 mph.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush with an updated fluid (Mobil Delvac ATF) may temporarily resolve the issue. Eventually, torque converter replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting between gears, especially during upshifts or downshifts.
    *   Solution: Check and replace transmission fluid if needed. If the fluid is clean, the valve body should be inspected. Common for solenoids within the valve body to go bad and cause poor shift quality.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Shocks Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking shocks, degraded ride quality, and "Service Ride Control" message displayed. The MRC shocks are prone to failure over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed MRC shocks. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, the air compressor running constantly and noisy, or a "Service Ride Control" message.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor and check for leaks in the air lines and air springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Screen goes blank, freezes, or malfunctions. The infotainment system can experience various software and hardware issues.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If that fails, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced or reprogrammed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a short period, preventing the vehicle from starting.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw by testing all circuits on the vehicle and find the circuit that is using power when the car is off. Some of the common causes are amplifiers, infotainment systems, BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate fails to open or close properly, becomes stuck, or makes unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts, motor, and latch mechanism. Replace any faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard, especially in hot climates. This is typically caused by the sun drying out the material.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement is the best option. There are also companies that can repair the dashboard but those repairs are only cosmetic and do not last a long time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Cadillac Escalade has some notable issues. The engine is prone to AFM lifter failure and oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. The transmission may exhibit torque converter shudder and harsh shifting. Suspension issues, such as MRC shock and air suspension compressor failures, can also occur. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and battery drain are also relatively common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major repairs, with costs varying accordingly. The cracked dash is a prevalent issue that is only cosmetic but can be costly to fix. Before purchasing, it is crucial to inspect these areas carefully and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
