The 2024 Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spaciousness, opulent interior, and powerful engine options. Available engines include a 6.2L V8 producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo Diesel producing 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. People generally love the Escalade for its road presence, comfortable ride (especially with Magnetic Ride Control), and technology features. Common dislikes often include its large size making it difficult to park, and the relatively high price tag.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, check engine light illumination. This is often caused by the AFM lifters collapsing, preventing the affected cylinder from firing. This issue is more prevalent in earlier versions of the AFM lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often requiring removal of the cylinder head. Some owners opt to delete the AFM system entirely to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair approach.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, white smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, engine misfires, potential for engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable clunking or jerking during gear changes, hesitation when shifting, particularly between lower gears.
    *   Solution: Often requires a software update or reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for software updates; $800 - $2,500+ for valve body replacement; $4,000 - $8,000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting lower than normal, particularly on one side, "Service Ride Control" message displayed on the dashboard, the air suspension compressor constantly running or not running at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.  Sometimes, the air struts or lines can leak, causing the compressor to overwork and fail, so those need to be checked as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ depending on the source of the failure.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Screen freezing, unresponsive touch inputs, system reboots, loss of audio, problems with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released to address these issues. In some cases, a hard reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates (if under warranty or performed by the dealership); $500 - $2,000+ for infotainment unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Driver Assistance Features Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Adaptive cruise control disengaging, lane keep assist not functioning properly, blind-spot monitoring system errors, false collision warnings.
    *   Solution: May require recalibration of the sensors, software updates, or replacement of faulty sensors or modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the specific issue and components involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or rattling noises when opening or closing, water leaks, failure to open or close completely.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the tracks and seals may resolve minor noise issues. More serious problems may require replacement of the sunroof motor or entire assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for lubrication; $500 - $2,000+ for motor or assembly replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Running Board Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Running boards failing to extend or retract, making unusual noises during operation, becoming stuck in one position.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the hinges and joints.  If the motor is failing, it will need to be replaced
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for lubrication, $500 - $1,500+ for motor replacement.

**Summary:**

The 2024 Cadillac Escalade can have some issues, typical of a complex luxury vehicle. Engine problems like AFM lifter failure in the 6.2L V8 and fuel injector issues in the 3.0L Duramax diesel can be expensive to fix, potentially costing thousands of dollars. Transmission issues are also a concern. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and driver assistance features are common. Suspension and exterior issues, while less frequent, can add to the overall cost of ownership. While not every Escalade will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of them and factor repair costs into their budget.
