The 2019 Cadillac Escalade is a luxury full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and upscale features. Available engine options include the 6.2L V8 engine, producing 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Escalade's comfortable ride, opulent interior, and impressive towing capacity. However, common complaints include a high price tag, large size making it difficult to maneuver, and the sometimes-unreliable infotainment system.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, misfires, reduced power, and potential engine damage. The AFM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, can experience lifter failure due to design flaws or lubrication issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and possibly the camshaft. Some owners opt to disable the AFM system altogether with aftermarket tuning or AFM delete kits to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an excessive amount of oil between oil changes, requiring frequent topping off. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions range from replacing the valve cover, PCV valve, or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10L80/10L90)**

*   **Harsh or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit hard shifts, jerking, slipping, or hesitation when shifting gears. The transmission can clunk as well.
    *   Solution: The valve body may need replacement or reconditioning. Software updates and reprogramming can also address some shifting issues. In some cases, complete transmission replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (reprogramming) - $5,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of ride quality, excessive bouncing, and clunking noises from the suspension. The MRC shocks, which use a special fluid to adjust damping, can fail due to leaks or internal component issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed MRC shocks. Replacing in pairs is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**

    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealership may resolve some issues. In severe cases, the infotainment module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, resulting in a dead battery or difficulty starting the vehicle. This can be caused by parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve replacing a faulty module or wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per tail light
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Running Boards Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power running boards may fail to extend or retract properly, or may make excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Lubricate pivot points; Replace the motor assembly, linkages, or the entire running board assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Delamination of Dash or Door Panel Material**
