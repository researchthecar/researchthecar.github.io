The 2002 Cadillac Escalade marked a significant point in the luxury SUV market. It came standard with a 5.3L Vortec V8 engine producing 285 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, or an optional 6.0L Vortec V8 engine producing 345 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Escalade's spacious interior, powerful engine (especially the 6.0L), and bold styling. However, common complaints included poor fuel economy, a somewhat truck-like ride, and a propensity for certain mechanical and electrical issues as the vehicle aged.

**Engine**

**5.3L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption can occur, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust might also be present.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the valve stem seals can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks externally from the front or rear of the engine and/or internally causing white smoke from the exhaust pipe. Overheating may occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Vortec V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.3L, excessive oil consumption can be a problem.
    *   Solution: Same as the 5.3L - valve stem seal replacement, piston ring replacement or engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knocking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Audible knocking noise coming from the engine, especially when cold. Could indicate piston slap.
    *   Solution: While the noise may not immediately impact performance, some owners choose to rebuild the engine to address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60-E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip between gears, shift harshly, or fail to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Often requires a transmission rebuild or replacement. Sometimes, a faulty shift solenoid can be the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. Can also cause stalling.
