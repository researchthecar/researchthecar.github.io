### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Cadillac Escalade is a capable luxury SUV, but its age means potential buyers should be prepared for some common issues. The Vortec V8 engines are generally strong, but intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler lines can develop leaks. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4L60-E, such as torque converter problems, are not uncommon. The air suspension system, while providing a comfortable ride, is a known area for potential costly repairs due to compressor or air spring failures. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM, and alternator failures can also occur. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling are also prevalent on vehicles of this vintage. Despite these potential drawbacks, addressing these known issues can result in a reliable and enjoyable luxury SUV experience.
