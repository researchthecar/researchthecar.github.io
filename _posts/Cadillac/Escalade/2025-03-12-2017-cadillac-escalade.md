**Category: Engine**

**6.2L V8 (L86)**

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Fuel Management (AFM) system is designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders when full power is not needed. Lifter failure can cause a noticeable ticking or knocking sound from the engine, rough running, misfires, and in some cases, complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed lifters, often requiring the removal of the cylinder heads. In severe cases, the camshaft may also need replacement. Many owners choose to disable the AFM system to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can be due to faulty valve seals, piston rings, or issues with the AFM system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the source of the oil consumption. Repairs may involve replacing valve seals, piston rings, or addressing AFM-related issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Category: Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8L90)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8L90 transmission is known for exhibiting harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears. Some owners also report hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for a software reflash, $800 - $1,500+ for valve body replacement, $4,000 - $7,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation, especially at lower speeds or under light acceleration. This can be caused by deterioration of the torque converter clutch.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush may help in some cases, but torque converter replacement is often required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$2,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Category: Suspension**

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) system uses specialized shocks filled with a magneto-rheological fluid to adjust damping in real-time. Failures can manifest as a rough or bouncy ride, clunking noises from the suspension, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected MRC shocks. It's often recommended to replace shocks in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ per shock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with air suspension, the compressor may fail, leading to the vehicle sitting low or unevenly. This can also trigger warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Category: Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CUE (Cadillac User Experience) infotainment system can suffer from slow response times, screen freezing, and software glitches. Some owners have also reported issues with the touchscreen delaminating or becoming unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates may address some of the glitches. Touchscreen replacement may be necessary if delamination or unresponsiveness occurs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200 for software updates, $800 - $1,500+ for touchscreen replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be due to parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Repairs may involve replacing faulty modules or components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
