The 2021 Cadillac Escalade marked a significant redesign of the iconic luxury SUV, boasting a bolder exterior, a more opulent interior, and advanced technology. Engine options included a 6.2L V8 (420 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel (277 hp, 460 lb-ft of torque), both paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Escalade is praised for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and impressive technology features, particularly the curved OLED display. Common complaints often revolve around its large size making it difficult to park and maneuver, and some owners have reported issues with the new technology.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**
*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM)/Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, check engine light illuminated. Often occurs at relatively low mileage. The AFM/DFM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but the lifters can fail, leading to the above symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters and potentially the camshaft. Some owners opt to delete the AFM/DFM system entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold. Exhaust leak smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the broken bolts. Sometimes the manifold needs to be replaced as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duramax Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, loss of power, excessive smoke, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights related to DEF, potential limp mode, issues with DEF level sensors or pumps.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the DEF system, potentially including replacement of sensors, pumps, or injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, especially at lower speeds. Clunking noise during shifts.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) is sometimes effective. In other cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (recalibration) - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Typically requires transmission repair or replacement. The torque converter and internal clutch packs are common failure points.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Ride Suspension Failure (Applies to models equipped with air ride)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, warning lights on the dashboard, compressor failure.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per corner; $500-$1500+ for compressor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Magnetic Ride Control (MRC) Shock Absorber Failure (Applies to models equipped with MRC)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, fluid leaks from the shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected MRC shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per shock
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **OLED Screen Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Flickering, blacking out, freezing, or distorted display on the instrument cluster and infotainment screen.

**Summary:**

The 2021 Cadillac Escalade, while a luxurious and feature-rich SUV, has its share of potential problems. Engine issues such as AFM/DFM lifter failure on the 6.2L V8 and fuel injector problems on the 3.0L Diesel can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, primarily harsh shifting and slipping in the 10-speed automatic, are also common. Electrical glitches with the OLED screen and infotainment system are another area of concern. Suspension failures, specifically involving the air ride or magnetic ride control systems, can also lead to significant repair expenses. The cost of these repairs varies widely, with engine and transmission issues potentially running into the thousands of dollars. It's essential for prospective buyers to be aware of these potential issues and to have a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used 2021 Cadillac Escalade. While there may be software updates to address some problems, many will require part replacements.
