The 2001 Cadillac Seville, a luxury sedan, offered a blend of comfort and performance. Two engine options were available: the 4.6L Northstar V8 producing 275 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque in the SLS (Seville Luxury Sedan) trim, and a higher-output version in the STS (Seville Touring Sedan) trim, generating 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T80-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Seville for its smooth ride, spacious interior, and advanced features for its time. Common dislikes included the complex Northstar engine known for potential issues, and the car's somewhat dated styling compared to newer competitors.
