The 2003 Cadillac Seville, a full-size luxury sedan, aimed to offer a blend of performance and comfort. Available in SLS (Seville Luxury Sedan) and STS (Seville Touring Sedan) trims, it catered to buyers seeking a premium driving experience. The base SLS model came with a 4.6L Northstar V8 engine producing around 275 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. The STS model featured a more powerful version of the Northstar, bumping the output to around 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T80-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Seville's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and powerful engine. However, some common complaints included electrical issues, particularly with the instrument cluster and climate control, as well as potential problems with the Northstar engine's head bolts and oil leaks.
