The 2002 Cadillac Seville was a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and advanced features for its time. Engine options included the 4.6L Northstar V8, producing 275 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque in the SLS (Seville Luxury Sedan) and 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque in the STS (Seville Touring Sedan). Both engines were paired with a 4T80-E four-speed automatic transmission. While many appreciated its smooth performance and luxurious amenities, some common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the engine and electrical systems. Owners often cited concerns about the complexity of the Northstar engine and the cost of repairs.
