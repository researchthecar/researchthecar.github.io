### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Cadillac Seville, particularly with the Northstar V8 engines, can be a rewarding luxury car, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The primary concerns revolve around the Northstar engine's head gaskets and intake manifold gaskets, which can lead to significant repair costs if they fail. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter, are also noted. The advanced Magnetic Ride Control suspension, while offering a superior ride, can be expensive to repair if sensors or shocks fail. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and common exterior wear like clear coat peeling are also factors to consider. Regular maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended for this model.
