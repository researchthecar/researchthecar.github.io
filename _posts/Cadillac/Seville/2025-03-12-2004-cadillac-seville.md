The 2004 Cadillac Seville is a luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was offered in two trims: SLS (Seville Luxury Sedan) and STS (Seville Touring Sedan). The SLS was powered by a 4.6L Northstar V8 engine producing 275 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, while the STS featured a higher-output version of the same engine, rated at 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T80-E four-speed automatic transmission. People often praised the Seville for its smooth ride, powerful engine, and luxurious features. Common complaints included issues with the complex electronics, potential for high repair costs, and a dated design compared to some competitors.
