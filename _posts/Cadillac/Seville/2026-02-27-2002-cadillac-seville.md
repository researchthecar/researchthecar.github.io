### Summary Verdict

The Northstar V8 engines, particularly the L37 variants, are known for potential head gasket issues and intake manifold leaks, requiring significant repair costs. The adaptive air suspension can also be a source of expensive repairs due to leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or instrument cluster, are not uncommon.

Despite these potential issues, many owners find the Seville to be a comfortable and capable luxury car when properly maintained.
