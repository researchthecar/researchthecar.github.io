The 2005 Lincoln Town Car represents the final generation of this full-size, body-on-frame luxury sedan. It was known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and traditional styling. All 2005 Town Cars came equipped with a 4.6L Modular V8 engine producing 239 horsepower and 287 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Town Car for its smooth ride and reliability, while some dislike its dated styling and fuel economy compared to more modern vehicles. However, the spacious cabin, massive trunk and overall dependability keep it a popular used car choice.
