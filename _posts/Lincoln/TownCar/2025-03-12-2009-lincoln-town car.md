The 2009 Lincoln Town Car is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was only available with a single engine and transmission configuration: a 4.6L Modular V8 engine paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 4.6L V8 produces 239 horsepower and 287 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Town Car's smooth ride, ample rear legroom, and classic styling. However, some common complaints include dated technology, relatively poor fuel economy for its class, and a somewhat floaty handling feel.

**Engine**

**4.6L Modular V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The aluminum cylinder heads are known to have weak spark plug threads. This can lead to spark plugs being ejected from the cylinder head, causing a misfire and significant engine noise.
    *   Solution: Repairing the damaged threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the repair method and if the head needs to be removed)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original plastic intake manifold is prone to cracking, leading to coolant leaks. This can cause overheating and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold with an updated version, often made of aluminum or reinforced plastic.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Individual ignition coils can fail, leading to a misfire, rough running engine, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per coil (parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R70W/4R75W)**

*   **Shifting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or failure to shift. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the transmission may require a fluid flush, valve body repair/replacement, or a complete rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Possible unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension sags or collapses, leading to a very bouncy ride. The "Check Air Suspension" light may illuminate. Caused by leaks in the air springs (bags), a failing air compressor, or a faulty ride height sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the air springs, air compressor, or ride height sensor as needed. Some owners opt for a coil spring conversion kit to eliminate the air suspension altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per air spring, $300 - $800 for the compressor, $500 - $2000+ for a coil spring conversion.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose or wandering steering.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per ball joint (parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the temperature of the air coming from the vents on one side of the car. Clicking noises behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to respond to the key fob or door switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350 per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower body panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage, especially in areas with road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Preventative measures such as rustproofing can help slow down the process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per panel (depending on the severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2009 Lincoln Town Car, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. The air suspension is a known trouble spot, and can be costly to maintain. The 4.6L engine is generally reliable but susceptible to spark plug thread and intake manifold issues. The severity of the issues ranges from relatively minor (blend door actuator) to potentially significant (air suspension failure, transmission issues). The cost to fix these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and the repair method chosen.
