The 2006 Lincoln Town Car is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and traditional body-on-frame construction. It came equipped with a single engine option, the 4.6L Modular SOHC V8, producing 239 horsepower and 287 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4R70W four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Town Car's smooth ride, reliability (in some respects), and spacious trunk. Common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, a somewhat dated interior compared to competitors, and handling that isn't as precise as more modern vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.6L Modular SOHC V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak at the front of the intake manifold, causing overheating. Visible coolant loss may be observed.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold with an updated design (if available) to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can sometimes loosen or strip the threads in the cylinder head. This can result in a misfire and a ticking sound.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with a thread insert kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head, if the damage is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, often visible as oil residue on the engine block. Can cause a burning smell.

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or between 2nd and 3rd gear. Transmission slippage at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change. If that doesn't help, rebuild or replace the transmission. Inspect the valve body for wear or contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at lower speeds. Stalling at idle.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the car sagging, compressor failing to engage, "Check Air Suspension" warning light illuminated. Can be caused by leaks in the air springs (bags), compressor failure, or a faulty height sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the air springs (bags), compressor, or height sensor as needed. Many owners opt for a coil-spring conversion kit to eliminate the air suspension entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per air spring, $400 - $800 for the compressor, $500 - $1500 for coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found
