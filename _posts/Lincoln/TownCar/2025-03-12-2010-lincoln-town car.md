The 2010 Lincoln Town Car represents the end of an era for traditional, body-on-frame American luxury sedans. It came standard with a single engine and transmission option: a 4.6L Modular V8 engine producing 239 horsepower and 287 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission (4R75W). Known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and classic styling, the Town Car was favored for livery services and those seeking a smooth, quiet driving experience. However, some common complaints included its dated technology, relatively poor fuel economy, and somewhat cumbersome handling compared to more modern sedans.

**Engine**

**4.6L Modular V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can become loose or eject from the cylinder head, damaging the threads in the aluminum head. This can cause misfires, rough running, and a loud ticking noise.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on repair method and if you are doing it yourself or bringing it to a shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold, made of composite material, can develop cracks, leading to vacuum leaks. Symptoms include rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold with an updated version or a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R75W 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shifter Cable Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The shifter cable bushing deteriorates causing difficulty shifting gears, the shifter feeling loose, or the inability to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shifter cable bushing or replacing the entire shifter cable assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4R75W transmission may exhibit delayed engagement, particularly when shifting into drive or reverse, or harsh shifts between gears. This is usually caused by worn valve body.
    *   Solution: Replacing or remanufacturing the valve body and performing a transmission flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension system, responsible for maintaining ride height, can experience failures due to leaks in the air springs (bags), compressor malfunctions, or issues with the height sensors. This results in a sagging rear end, a bumpy ride, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs, compressor, or height sensors. Some owners opt for a coil spring conversion to eliminate the air suspension altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+ depending on the component replaced or if doing a complete conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature ball joint wear can cause noises, such as squeaking, popping, or clunking, as well as loose steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuator controls the temperature of the air coming from the vents. Failure can lead to only hot or cold air blowing, or inconsistent temperatures.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power windows or door locks. This can be due to faulty switches, wiring issues, or a failing window motor or door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause (switch, wiring, motor/actuator) and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per window/lock depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage/Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Particularly in regions with harsh winters and road salt, the undercarriage and frame can be susceptible to rust. This can compromise structural integrity over time.
    *   Solution: Rust remediation, including cleaning, treating, and coating the affected areas. Severely rusted frames may require welding or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions, including difficulty opening or closing, leaks, or unusual noises. This can be due to worn tracks, a faulty motor, or a clogged drain.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the tracks, replacing the motor, or clearing the drains.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $700+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Lincoln Town Car, while a comfortable and spacious vehicle, has several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most prevalent problems revolve around the engine's spark plug threads and intake manifold, the transmission's shifter cable bushing and shifting issues, the air suspension system, and various electrical components. While some repairs, like the shifter cable bushing, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as air suspension repairs or engine thread repair, can be costly. Rust is also a potential concern, especially in certain climates. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs, making a thorough inspection before purchase crucial.
