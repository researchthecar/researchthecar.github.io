The 2002 Lincoln Town Car is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and traditional body-on-frame construction. All 2002 Lincoln Town Cars came standard with a 4.6L SOHC V8 engine that produced 220 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The only available transmission option was a 4-speed automatic (4R70W). Owners generally praise the Town Car for its smooth ride, roomy interior, and reliability, while some criticisms include its dated styling, fuel economy, and handling compared to more modern luxury sedans.

**Summary**

The 2002 Lincoln Town Car, while generally reliable, can suffer from several common issues related to its age and design. The most prevalent problems involve the engine (intake manifold cracks, spark plug blowouts), transmission (slipping, torque converter failure), and air suspension (leaks and compressor failure). Electrical issues like blend door actuator and window regulator failures are also common. While some of these issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, others, such as transmission rebuilds or air suspension replacements, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
