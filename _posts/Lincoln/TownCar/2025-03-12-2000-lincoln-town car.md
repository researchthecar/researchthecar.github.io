The 2000 Lincoln Town Car is a full-size luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, spacious interior, and traditional styling. It was offered with a single engine option: the 4.6L Modular V8, producing 200 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque in Executive and Signature trims, and 220 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque in the Cartier trim. All models were equipped with a 4R70W four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Town Car's comfort, reliability, and ease of maintenance. Common complaints include its large size (making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces), dated styling, and relatively low fuel economy compared to modern vehicles.
