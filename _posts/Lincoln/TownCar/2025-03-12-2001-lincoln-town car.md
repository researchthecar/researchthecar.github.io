The 2001 Lincoln Town Car is a full-size luxury sedan known for its smooth ride, spacious interior, and traditional styling. It was offered with a single engine option, the 4.6L Modular V8, which produced 200 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with a 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Town Car for its comfort, reliability, and ease of maintenance. Some common criticisms include its somewhat dated styling, lower fuel economy compared to modern vehicles, and handling characteristics typical of a large sedan.

**Engine**

**4.6L Modular V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or leaking of the intake manifold, often near the coolant crossover. This can lead to coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage. A common symptom is a sweet coolant smell and/or low coolant levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs ejecting from the cylinder head due to stripped or damaged threads in the aluminum cylinder heads. This can cause a sudden loss of power and a loud popping noise.
    *   Solution: Repairing the cylinder head threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on repair method and damage)

**Summary**

The 2001 Lincoln Town Car, while generally reliable, can experience several common issues. The intake manifold and spark plug thread problems are potential engine concerns. Transmission issues related to the torque converter and valve body can also arise. Suspension problems, especially with the air suspension system, are typical due to the age of the vehicle. Electrical issues like blend door actuator failure are also frequently reported. Rust can be a significant concern in regions with road salt. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help maintain the car's reliability and longevity. Overall, these issues are not uncommon for a vehicle of this age and class, but they should be considered when evaluating a used 2001 Lincoln Town Car.
