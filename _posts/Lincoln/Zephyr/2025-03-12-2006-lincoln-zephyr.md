The 2006 Lincoln Zephyr marked Lincoln's re-entry into the entry-level luxury sedan market. All 2006 Zephyrs came equipped with a 3.0L Duratec 30 V6 engine producing 221 hp and 205 lb-ft of torque, paired with an Aisin AW 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Zephyr's comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and elegant styling, particularly the interior. Common complaints include mediocre fuel economy for its class and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.0L Duratec 30 V6**
*   **Coil Pack Failure**

**Summary**

The 2006 Lincoln Zephyr presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical problems to more substantial engine and transmission concerns. The 3.0L Duratec V6 is generally reliable but can suffer from coil pack and IMRC valve failures. The Aisin AW 6-speed transmission can develop harsh shifting or even experience torque converter failure, potentially leading to expensive repairs. Suspension components like struts and shocks are also prone to wear and tear. While not all Zephyrs will experience these issues, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and budget accordingly. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and the costs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
