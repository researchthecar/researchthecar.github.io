### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Lincoln Zephyr offers a comfortable ride, but potential buyers should be aware of certain reliability concerns. The 3.0L V6 engine can experience issues with its Variable Valve Timing system and coolant leaks. The automatic transmission may develop fluid leaks or solenoid problems. On the suspension side, worn control arm bushings are a common wear item that can lead to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and alternator failure, are also noted. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, these mechanical and electrical components represent the most frequent areas for potential repair.
