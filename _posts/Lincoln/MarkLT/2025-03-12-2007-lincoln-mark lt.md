The 2007 Lincoln Mark LT is a luxurious pickup truck based on the Ford F-150 platform. It offers a blend of comfort and utility, appealing to buyers seeking a refined truck experience. The Mark LT was available with a single engine option: the 5.4L Triton V8, producing 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission choice was a 4-speed automatic. People generally appreciate the Mark LT for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and upscale features. Common dislikes include its fuel economy, which is typical for a truck of its size, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue with the 5.4L Triton V8 is spark plug breakage during removal. The two-piece spark plugs are prone to seizing in the cylinder heads, and the top portion can separate from the bottom portion when attempting removal. This can leave the bottom portion of the spark plug stuck in the head, requiring special tools or professional assistance to remove. Symptoms can include rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Use the correct spark plug removal tool specifically designed for the 5.4L Triton engine. Ensure the engine is cool before attempting removal. Penetrating oil can also help loosen the spark plugs. In cases where the spark plug breaks, specialized extraction tools are needed to remove the remaining portion from the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of broken plugs and the need for professional extraction).
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 is known for issues with its variable valve timing (VVT) system, specifically the cam phasers. These phasers can wear or fail, causing engine rattling, especially at idle or during start-up. Other symptoms include rough running, reduced power, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light with codes related to VVT system performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chain, and potentially other related components like the timing chain tensioners and guides. It is recommended to replace all related parts as a kit to ensure proper function and longevity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Exhaust Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold studs on the 5.4L Triton V8 are prone to breaking. This results in an exhaust leak, which can be heard as a ticking or hissing sound, especially when the engine is cold. The leak can also cause a decrease in fuel economy and performance.
    *   Solution: Removal of the broken studs and installation of new, stronger studs. This may require drilling out the broken studs, which can be a time-consuming and difficult task. Often the exhaust manifold itself will need to be resurfaced as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the number of broken studs and ease of access).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R75E)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4R75E transmission can develop issues with delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between first and second gear, and sometimes between other gears. This can be caused by worn valve body components, a failing transmission control module (TCM), or low transmission fluid level.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or dirty, a fluid and filter change may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a valve body rebuild or replacement, or TCM replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $1500+ (valve body or TCM replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Sagging Rear Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, causing the rear of the truck to sit lower than normal. This can affect ride quality, handling, and load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for towing or hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuator controls the temperature of the air coming out of the vents. A failing actuator can cause the air to be stuck on hot, cold, or a mix of both, regardless of the temperature setting. You may also hear a clicking sound behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blend door actuator. This can be a challenging repair due to the location of the actuator behind the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on labor costs).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Bed Rails/Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2007 Lincoln Mark LT, like other trucks of this era, can be susceptible to rust, especially on the bed rails and wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting. In severe cases, replacement of the affected body panels may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof can experience issues with opening, closing, or leaking. This can be caused by a faulty motor, damaged seals, or a clogged drain.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, seals, or cleaning of the drain lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Lincoln Mark LT, while offering a comfortable and luxurious ride, is prone to some common issues typical of vehicles of its age. The most significant concerns revolve around the 5.4L Triton V8 engine, particularly spark plug breakage and cam phaser failure, which can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical issues, like sagging springs and blend door actuator failure, are also commonly reported. Exterior rust can also be a concern depending on the vehicle's location and maintenance history. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the engine for signs of cam phaser noise, check the transmission for smooth shifting, and examine the body for rust.
