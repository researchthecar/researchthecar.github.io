The 2012 Lincoln Mark LT is a rebadged Ford F-150, offering a more luxurious pickup truck experience. It was only offered with a single engine option, the 5.4L Triton V8 engine, which produced 310 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Mark LT for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and the added features compared to the standard F-150. Some common dislikes include the fuel economy, which is typical for a truck of this size, and its price point, which was higher than comparable F-150 models.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 engine in the 2012 Mark LT is known for having issues with spark plugs breaking upon removal. The two-piece spark plug design can seize in the cylinder head. If they seize, the tips will break when removing them and remain in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Removal requires patience and a specialized extraction tool designed to remove broken plugs. Pre-soaking the plugs with penetrating oil can help. Avoid breaking the spark plugs in the first place. Torque to 14 ft/lbs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on whether the plugs can be removed without breaking and if any plugs break inside the head.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue with the 5.4L Triton V8 is excessive noise coming from the engine, described as a ticking or rattling sound, particularly at idle or low speeds. This is often attributed to worn or failing cam phasers. This is part of the variable valve timing (VVT) system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers and possibly timing chains, guides, and tensioners. Requires specialized tools and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold bolts tend to break. This can lead to exhaust leaks, most noticeable as a ticking sound at startup that may diminish as the engine warms up.
    *   Solution: Removal of the broken bolts. Installing an exhaust manifold and new bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on whether the bolts can be removed easily.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R80)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6R80 transmission can experience rough or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement, especially when cold. These issues can be caused by a faulty valve body, worn solenoids, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service, this includes a new transmission fluid filter and fresh fluid. If this doesn't solve the issue, the valve body will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on the fix.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported premature sagging of the rear leaf springs, leading to a reduced load capacity and a "bottoming out" sensation when carrying heavy loads or towing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with upgraded or heavy-duty versions. Adding helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **F-150 platform, Electrical Issues Apply**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mark LT shares many components with the F-150, so electrical issues can range from minor glitches to major malfunctions. These can include problems with the power windows, door locks, radio, and instrument cluster. Issues with the trailer brake controller have also been reported.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is recommended. Specific repairs will depend on the nature of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is often found on the undercarriage and along the wheel wells, especially in areas where road salt is used.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and treating the affected areas with rust inhibitor and applying protective coatings. Repair or replacement of severely rusted panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroofs can leak, particularly around the seals, allowing water to enter the cabin.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof seals. Replacing the seals or the entire sunroof assembly in severe cases. Ensure the drain tubes are clear of debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Heated/Cooled Seat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the heated and cooled seats is a common complaint. This can be due to a faulty heating/cooling element, a malfunctioning control module, or damaged wiring.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating/cooling element, control module, or repairing the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Summary**

The 2012 Lincoln Mark LT, while offering a luxurious take on the F-150, shares some of the same common issues as its Ford counterpart, particularly with the 5.4L Triton V8 engine. Cam Phaser issues and broken spark plugs are some of the most expensive repairs, however can be mitigated if the vehicles are properly maintained. The electrical gremlins and transmission issues can also be costly to diagnose and repair, while other issues like rust and interior problems are more common and can vary in severity. Overall, the Mark LT can be a comfortable and capable truck but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
