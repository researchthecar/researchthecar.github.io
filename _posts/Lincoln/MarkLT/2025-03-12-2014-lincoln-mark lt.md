The 2014 Lincoln Mark LT, a rebadged Ford F-150, aimed to offer a luxurious pickup experience. It was only offered in Mexico. Its only engine option was the 5.0L V8 Coyote engine, producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Mark LT for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and distinctive styling compared to its Ford counterpart. However, some common complaints revolve around fuel economy, its size making it difficult to park and maneuver in tight spaces, and the fact that some find it difficult to source parts for it in the US since it was never sold in the United States.
