The 2010 Lincoln Mark LT is a full-size pickup truck based on the Ford F-150. It was only offered with a single engine option: a 5.4L Triton V8 producing 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mark LT for its luxurious interior and comfortable ride, while some find the fuel economy and towing capacity to be less competitive compared to other trucks in its class. The 4-speed automatic transmission is also a commonly cited area of dislike for the Mark LT.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 is notorious for its two-piece spark plugs that can break off in the cylinder head during removal. This can lead to misfires, rough running, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Special tools are required to extract the broken spark plug without damaging the cylinder head. Some mechanics recommend using penetrating oil and carefully working the spark plug back and forth before attempting removal. Replacing with updated one-piece spark plugs is recommended after removal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the number of broken plugs and the need for cylinder head repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Noise/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 is known for timing chain rattle, especially on startup. This is often caused by worn or failed cam phasers, which are part of the variable valve timing system. This can also lead to decreased performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chains, chain guides, and tensioners. Often the oil pump is replaced at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, especially between gears. This can also manifest as transmission slipping, where the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush, valve body replacement or repair, or complete transmission rebuild or replacement, or updating the PCM with the latest software
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $500 - $1500 (valve body), $2500 - $5000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, particularly if the vehicle is frequently used for towing or hauling. This can lead to a rougher ride, reduced load capacity, and a noticeable drop in the rear of the vehicle. In more extreme cases, the leaf springs can even break.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the power windows and door locks, including intermittent operation, failure to respond, or complete failure. This can be caused by faulty switches, wiring problems, or a failing door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty switches, repairing wiring, or replacing the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Handle Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The tailgate handle on the Mark LT can be prone to failure, making it difficult or impossible to open the tailgate. This is often due to a broken plastic clip or linkage within the handle mechanism.
    * Solution: Replacing the tailgate handle assembly. Aftermarket options offer more durable replacements.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof can get stuck, make noise, or leak.
    *   Solution: Lubrication, track cleaning, or motor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Lincoln Mark LT has some notable issues, particularly with the 5.4L Triton V8 engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, and suspension. The engine issues, especially the spark plug and cam phaser problems, can be costly to repair. While some electrical and interior issues exist, they are generally less severe. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in the potential repair costs when considering the purchase of a used 2010 Lincoln Mark LT. The age of the vehicle contributes to these problems, even if the vehicle is low mileage and well taken care of.
