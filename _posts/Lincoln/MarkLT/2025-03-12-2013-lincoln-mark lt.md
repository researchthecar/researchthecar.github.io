The 2013 Lincoln Mark LT is a luxury pickup truck based on the Ford F-150 platform. It was only available with a single engine option: a 5.0L Ti-VCT V8 engine producing 360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Mark LT for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and powerful engine. However, some common complaints include its fuel economy, which is typical for a full-size truck, and potential reliability issues stemming from its shared components with the F-150.

**Engine**

**5.0L Ti-VCT V8**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between changes. This can manifest as the need to add a quart or more every few thousand miles. It can be related to the PVC valve and/or oil rings.
    * Solution: Some have had success with replacing the PCV valve. In more severe cases, the piston rings need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 for the PCV valve replacement; $3,000 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Knocking or Ticking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine knocking or ticking noises, particularly at startup or idle. This can potentially be related to the variable valve timing (VVT) system or other internal engine components.
    * Solution: Diagnosis is critical to determine the source of the noise. Potential repairs range from VVT component replacement to more extensive engine work.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R80)**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. This may also be related to shuddering.
    * Solution: A software update of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve some issues. Otherwise, valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for software update; $800 - $1,500 for valve body replacement; $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission rebuild.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, hesitation during acceleration, or complete failure to engage gears. This can be related to low fluid levels, worn clutches, or valve body issues.
    * Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid. If the fluid is dark or contains debris, a transmission flush or rebuild may be necessary. Inspect the valve body and clutch packs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid change; $800 - $1,500 for valve body replacement; $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission rebuild.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Noises (Clunking, Squeaking)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners sometimes report clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. This can be attributed to worn-out ball joints, tie rod ends, sway bar links, or bushings.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components. Lubricating bushings might temporarily alleviate squeaking.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 per component depending on the part and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sync System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The MyLincoln Touch (Sync) system can be buggy and slow to respond. Issues include freezing, Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation errors, and general unresponsiveness.
    * Solution: Try performing a master reset of the Sync system. If the problems persist, a software update from the dealer may be needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset); $100 - $300 for software update (if available).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window/Door Lock Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows or door locks. This could be caused by faulty switches, wiring issues, or a failing actuator.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the problem (switch, wiring, or actuator) and replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door, depending on the component replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficultly opening or closing the tailgate. This can be caused by a faulty latch mechanism, damaged cables, or a misaligned tailgate.
    * Solution: Inspect the tailgate latch, cables, and hinges. Lubricate moving parts or replace damaged components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+, depending on the severity and parts needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may leak, get stuck, or fail to open/close properly. This could be due to a faulty motor, damaged seals, or debris in the track.
    * Solution: Clean the sunroof tracks and lubricate the seals. If the motor is faulty, it will need to be replaced. If the seals are damaged, they should also be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for cleaning and lubrication; $300 - $800+ for motor or seal replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Lincoln Mark LT shares many components with the Ford F-150, resulting in similar reliability concerns. Engine issues like oil consumption and ticking noises can be costly to address. Transmission problems such as harsh shifting and slipping can also lead to significant repair bills. While the Mark LT offers a luxurious experience, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of the issues varies, but addressing engine or transmission problems can be expensive.
