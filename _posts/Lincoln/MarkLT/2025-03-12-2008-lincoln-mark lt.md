**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 engine is notorious for its two-piece spark plugs that are prone to breaking off inside the cylinder head during removal. This is due to carbon buildup on the plug's extended electrode. Symptoms include difficulty removing spark plugs, broken spark plugs, and potential engine misfires if the remaining portion of the plug is not extracted correctly.
    *   Solution: Special tools are available to extract the broken spark plug. The cylinder head may need to be removed in some cases. Applying penetrating oil or heat to the spark plug area before removal can sometimes help. Using one-piece spark plugs for replacement is highly recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the number of plugs that break and whether the cylinder head needs to be removed.
        *Recalls: None Found*
*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 engines are known to have issues with the Variable Cam Timing (VCT) system. The cam phasers, which control the timing of the camshafts, can wear out or fail, causing symptoms such as engine rattling at startup (especially when hot), rough idling, loss of power, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chains, chain tensioners, and guides is the common solution. Updated cam phaser designs are available that are less prone to failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold studs are prone to breaking, resulting in exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking or hissing noise, especially at startup, reduced fuel economy, and a possible exhaust smell inside the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken exhaust manifold studs or the entire exhaust manifold. Using updated, stronger studs is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears.
    * Solution: A common solution to correct a harsh-shifting transmission is to first check the fluid level and condition. In some cases, the transmission control module may need to be updated or replaced.

    *   Description/Symptoms: The front suspension ball joints can wear out prematurely, leading to looseness in the steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear. Symptoms may include a wobbly steering wheel, difficulty maintaining a straight line, and excessive play when inspecting the ball joints.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints. It is often recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints at the same time.
