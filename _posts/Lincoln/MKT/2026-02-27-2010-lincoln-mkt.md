### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Lincoln MKT, while offering a luxurious experience, presents a mixed reliability profile. The V6 engines, particularly the 3.7L, can experience coolant leaks and timing chain issues, while the more potent 3.5L EcoBoost is susceptible to turbocharger problems and intake manifold runner issues. Transmission concerns, such as hesitation and TCM faults, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, can be a nuisance. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components generally hold up well, with no widespread critical failures reported in these areas. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to engine and transmission warnings are advised for owners.
