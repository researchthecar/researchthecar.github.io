**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Liftgate fails to open or close automatically, makes unusual noises, or stops mid-cycle.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts, motor, and latch. Replace faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

**Summary**

The 2013 Lincoln MKT presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from moderate to severe. Turbocharger failure, water pump failure, and suspension problems represent more significant and costly repairs. Electrical glitches with the MyLincoln Touch system can be frustrating, although often not as expensive to address as mechanical problems. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to substantial repair bills. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, particularly focusing on the turbochargers, suspension, and infotainment system.
