The 2014 Lincoln MKT is a full-size luxury crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, distinctive styling, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 3.7L V6 producing 303 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 that cranks out 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the MKT's smooth ride and quiet cabin. Common criticisms include its polarizing exterior design and some reports of reliability issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive oil consumption, whistling noise from the engine bay, check engine light. Can be caused by oil starvation due to clogged oil lines or worn-out turbochargers.

*   **Water Pump Failure (Internal)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, coolant leaking into the engine oil, white smoke from the exhaust. The internal water pump is driven by the timing chain, and its failure can cause serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump and timing chain components. Flush the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L V6**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling, hesitation during acceleration, check engine light. The electronic throttle body can become clogged or fail electronically.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the throttle body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Transmission**

*   **6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, transmission warning light. Can be caused by worn-out valve body, low transmission fluid, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, repair or replace valve body, or rebuild/replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, stalling, poor fuel economy, transmission slipping, abnormal noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It is often recommended to replace the transmission fluid and filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500-$3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, air compressor running constantly, ride height issues, warning lights on the dashboard. Air springs or compressor failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air springs, compressor, or associated sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MyLincoln Touch (Sync 2) Issues**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car needs to be jumped to start, or will not start after sitting for a period of time.
    *   Solution: Conduct a parasitic draw test to determine which circuit is draining power when the car is off. Common culprits can be related to a faulty door actuator, the MyLincoln Touch system, or any aftermarket devices installed that are not shutting down properly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$1,000+ (can vary greatly depending on what is causing the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent temperature, air not blowing hot or cold, malfunctioning blend door actuators.

**Summary**

The 2014 Lincoln MKT can present owners with a range of issues, from relatively minor electrical glitches to more serious engine and transmission problems. Turbocharger and water pump failures on the EcoBoost engine can be costly, as can air suspension repairs and transmission replacements. The MyLincoln Touch system is a common source of frustration. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can quickly add up, making pre-purchase inspection and a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's history essential. Severity ranges from annoying infotainment issues to major mechanical failures.
