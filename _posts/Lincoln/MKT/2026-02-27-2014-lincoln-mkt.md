### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Lincoln MKT presents a generally reliable profile, with most reported issues falling into predictable categories for a vehicle of its age and complexity. The EcoBoost engine, while offering enhanced performance, has a higher propensity for specific issues like turbocharger problems and sensor failures compared to the standard V6. Transmission concerns, primarily related to shifting quality and potential internal wear, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SYNC infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are common themes. However, the exterior and interior components have largely proven durable, with no widespread critical failures documented. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can mitigate many of these potential reliability concerns.
