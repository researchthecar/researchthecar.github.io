**Introduction:**

The 2011 Lincoln MKT is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV manufactured by Ford Motor Company. It was offered with a choice of two engines: a 3.7L V6 and a 3.5L V6 EcoBoost. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The MKT was praised for its spacious interior, refined ride quality, and luxurious amenities; however, it was criticized for its high price and lack of standard features.

**Engine:**

**3.7L V6**

* **Cam Phaser Failure:** The cam phaser, a component responsible for adjusting the timing of the camshaft, can fail, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and poor fuel economy. Solution: Replacing the cam phaser. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+. Recalls: None Found

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak and leading to reduced power, rough idling, and poor fuel economy. Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+. Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 EcoBoost**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbochargers can fail, resulting in reduced power, increased fuel consumption, and a whistling or whining sound from the engine. Solution: Replacing the turbocharger. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+. Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure:** The fuel injectors can fail, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and poor fuel economy. Solution: Replacing the fuel injectors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,000. Recalls: None Found

**Transmission:**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** The shift solenoids, which control the transmission's gear changes, can fail, causing rough shifting, slipping gears, or a complete loss of transmission function. Solution: Replacing the shift solenoids. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+. Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter, which transfers power from the engine to the transmission, can fail, resulting in slipping gears, shuddering, or a complete loss of transmission function. Solution: Replacing the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+. Recalls: None Found
