### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Lincoln MKT generally presents a solid reliability record, with most reported issues falling into predictable categories for a vehicle of its size and complexity. The EcoBoost engine, while powerful, can be susceptible to turbocharger and intake manifold issues, and the 3.7L V6 may experience cooling system leaks or timing chain problems. Transmission concerns often involve minor hesitations or leaks, typically addressable with fluid services or seal replacements. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items that can develop noise or affect handling. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SYNC infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble can help mitigate most potential reliability concerns for MKT owners.
