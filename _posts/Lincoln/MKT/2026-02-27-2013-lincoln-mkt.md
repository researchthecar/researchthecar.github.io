### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Lincoln MKT presents a generally solid reliability record, with most reported issues falling into categories common for luxury vehicles of its era. The powertrain, particularly the 3.7L V6, is relatively robust, though the EcoBoost variant can encounter turbocharger and timing chain concerns. Transmission issues, such as shuddering or overheating, are not uncommon and often require professional attention. Electrical gremlins, especially with the SYNC infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are notable points of concern. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts may require replacement over time. While the exterior and interior are largely free of widespread defects, specific components like climate control blend door actuators can fail. Overall, the MKT offers a comfortable and feature-rich experience, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability considerations.
