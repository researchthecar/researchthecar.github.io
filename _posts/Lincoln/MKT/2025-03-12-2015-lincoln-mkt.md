The 2015 Lincoln MKT is a full-size luxury crossover SUV, known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. Engine options include a 3.7L V6 producing 303 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 delivering 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the MKT's ample passenger and cargo space, quiet cabin, and available features, but some criticisms include the polarizing exterior design, less-than-stellar fuel economy, and complex infotainment system.
