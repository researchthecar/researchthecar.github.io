The 2010 Lincoln MKT is a large luxury crossover SUV that was Lincoln's attempt to capture a share of the growing market segment. It offered distinctive styling, a spacious interior, and a comfortable ride. The 2010 MKT came with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 3.7L V6 producing around 268 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque, and a more potent 3.5L EcoBoost turbocharged V6, delivering approximately 355 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the MKT for its luxurious features, comfortable seating, and distinctive design. Criticisms often included its polarizing exterior styling, less than stellar fuel economy, and occasional reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2010 Lincoln MKT has its share of potential issues, ranging from engine and transmission problems to suspension and electrical glitches. The EcoBoost engine, while offering good power, has turbocharger vulnerabilities. The MyLincoln Touch system can be a source of frustration due to its laggy performance and potential for electrical problems. Air suspension and water leaks can also be problematic. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue, but major repairs like turbocharger replacements or air suspension fixes can be quite expensive. While not all MKTs will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor them into their purchasing decision.
