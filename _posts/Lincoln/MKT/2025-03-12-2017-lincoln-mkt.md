The 2017 Lincoln MKT is a full-size luxury crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and distinctive styling. It was available with two engine options: a 3.7L V6 producing 303 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. While many appreciate its smooth ride and upscale features, some owners have expressed concerns about its reliability and complex electronics. The MKT offers a refined driving experience and caters to those seeking a luxurious and spacious SUV. One of the main issues that owners have faced is with the PTU.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling or whining noise from the engine bay, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting or Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission shifts hard between gears, hesitates, or slips. This can become more noticeable as the vehicle ages.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is key. It could be a software issue that a flash update will fix, or it could be internal damage which could be from worn clutches or valve body issues, which requires a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for flash update. $3000-$7000 for transmission repair/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Drivetrain**

*   **PTU (Power Transfer Unit) Failure (AWD Models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise, fluid leaks, and eventually complete failure of the PTU, leading to loss of all-wheel drive. The PTU is prone to overheating due to its small size and limited cooling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the PTU and addressing any related damage. Regular fluid changes (more frequent than recommended) can help extend its lifespan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging, especially overnight, compressor failing to engage, "ride height" error messages, and a generally rougher ride. This often stems from leaks in the air springs or issues with the compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air springs, repairing or replacing the air compressor, and addressing any issues with the ride height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per air spring, $500 - $1,000+ for the compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **SYNC System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and general unresponsiveness of the SYNC infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Performing a "master reset," updating the SYNC software, or, in more severe cases, replacing the SYNC module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) to $500 - $1,500+ (module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicleâ€™s battery frequently dies, especially if it sits for a few days. This can be attributed to a parasitic draw from a module not shutting down properly.
    *   Solution: Finding the source of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include aftermarket electronics, faulty door lock actuators, or a malfunctioning SYNC module. Diagnostic work is key.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate fails to open or close properly, makes unusual noises, or stops functioning altogether. This may be due to a faulty actuator, worn struts, or issues with the control module.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty actuator or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent heating or cooling, with one side blowing hot while the other blows cold, or a complete failure of the system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing issues with the blend door actuators, refrigerant levels, or the climate control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Lincoln MKT, particularly models equipped with the 3.5L EcoBoost engine and all-wheel drive, can present owners with several potential issues. The PTU failure and turbocharger issues can be costly to repair. Air suspension problems can be common as well. While the SYNC system issues may be less critical, they can be frustrating. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and budget accordingly for possible repairs. Pre-purchase inspections and thorough maintenance records are highly recommended.
