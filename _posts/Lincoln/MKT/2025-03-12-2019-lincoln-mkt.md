Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Lincoln MKT, categorized by major component.

The 2019 Lincoln MKT is a full-size luxury crossover SUV that offered comfortable seating for up to seven passengers and a smooth ride. Owners often appreciate its spacious interior, distinctive styling (though polarizing for some), and available advanced technology features. Conversely, some criticisms include its dated design compared to newer competitors, fuel economy, and cumbersome handling. The MKT came with two engine options: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing 303 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
