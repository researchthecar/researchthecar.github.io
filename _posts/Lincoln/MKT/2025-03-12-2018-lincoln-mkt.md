The 2018 Lincoln MKT is a full-size luxury crossover SUV known for its spacious interior and distinctive styling. The MKT offered two engine choices: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing 303 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 generating 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the MKT's comfortable ride and ample passenger and cargo space. Some common complaints revolve around its fuel economy, dated infotainment system, and polarizing exterior design.
