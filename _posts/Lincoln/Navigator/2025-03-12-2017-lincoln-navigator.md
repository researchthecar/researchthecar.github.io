Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2017 Lincoln Navigator, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2017 Lincoln Navigator marked the end of the third generation before a major redesign in 2018. It's powered by a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine producing 380 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While owners often praise its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and towing capability, common complaints revolve around electronic glitches, drivetrain issues, and general reliability concerns stemming from the age of the design and components. There was no 2WD configuration in 2017, and the only engine option was the 3.5L EcoBoost.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbochargers, loss of power, potential engine misfires, check engine light. Can be caused by oil starvation or bearing failure.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Inspect oil lines and ensure proper lubrication.

**Summary**

The 2017 Lincoln Navigator, while offering a luxurious and comfortable experience, is prone to several issues, particularly those related to its aging electrical systems, air suspension, and powertrain. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to address (ignition coils), others, like turbocharger failure or coolant intrusion, can be quite costly. The severity of potential problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, emphasizing the importance of a thorough pre-purchase inspection and consideration of extended warranties. The vehicle is an older model, so these issues are likely to arise at some point.
