The 2002 Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. It was available with two engine options: a 5.4L SOHC 2V V8 producing 230 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L DOHC 32V V8 producing 300 horsepower and 355 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the Navigator for its towing capacity, comfortable seating, and luxurious features. Common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy and some reliability issues stemming from the age of the vehicle and the complexity of its systems.

**Engine**

**5.4L SOHC 2V V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to shallow threads in the aluminum head. This often results in a loud popping noise, engine misfire, and potential damage to the surrounding components.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head, or install spark plug thread inserts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold can crack, leading to vacuum leaks, rough idling, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L DOHC 32V V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2V engine, the 4V engine can also experience spark plug blowout due to shallow threads in the aluminum head. This often results in a loud popping noise, engine misfire, and potential damage to the surrounding components.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head, or install spark plug thread inserts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While less common on the 2002 model year compared to later versions of the 5.4L 3V engine, cam phaser issues can occur. Symptoms include a rattling noise at startup, rough idle, and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam phasers, timing chains, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Slipping and Hard Shifting**

The 2002 Lincoln Navigator, while offering a luxurious and spacious experience, is prone to certain reliability issues due to its age and complex systems. Engine issues, particularly spark plug blowout and intake manifold cracking, are common and can be moderately expensive to repair. Transmission problems, especially slipping and hard shifting, can also occur and often require significant investment. The air suspension system is another area of concern, with potential failures leading to costly repairs. Electrical and interior issues are also present, but tend to be less severe in terms of cost. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering a 2002 Lincoln Navigator.
