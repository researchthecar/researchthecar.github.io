### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Lincoln Navigator, equipped with the 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, presents a generally reliable package for a large luxury SUV. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as timing chain wear, turbocharger problems, and occasional transmission harshness. The adaptive air suspension, while providing a comfortable ride, can be a source of costly repairs if air springs or the compressor fail. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and power running boards, are also noted. Despite these points, many Navigators of this vintage perform well with proper maintenance, and the issues, while specific, are not universally experienced by all vehicles.
