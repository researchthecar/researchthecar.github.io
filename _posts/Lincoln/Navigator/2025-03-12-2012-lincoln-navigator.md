**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with spark plugs breaking during removal, particularly on vehicles with higher mileage. This is often attributed to the spark plugs seizing in the cylinder heads due to corrosion. Symptoms can include a misfire, rough running, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Professional removal using specialized tools or techniques may be required. Sometimes, the cylinder head needs to be removed for extraction. Anti-seize compound should be used on new spark plugs upon installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and whether cylinder head removal is necessary)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Roller Follower Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported failures of the roller followers on the valves. If these followers fail, the cylinder head will have to be disassembled to replace the roller followers. If left in the engine, they can cause catastrophic damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the roller followers on the valve. Disassembly of the cylinder head is required. If there is damage caused to other parts of the engine, they will have to be fixed/replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and whether cylinder head removal is necessary)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R80)**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "bump" or "jerk" during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Diagnose with a scan tool to check for transmission related codes. Could be caused by low fluid, damaged valve body, or a worn torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and whether the transmission needs to be replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Navigator's air suspension system is a common source of complaints. Symptoms include the vehicle sagging on one or more corners, a "suspension fault" warning light, and a compressor that runs constantly or not at all. This is often caused by leaks in the air springs, faulty height sensors, or a failing air compressor.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair leaks in the air springs, replace faulty height sensors, or replace the air compressor. In some cases, owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension to eliminate the air suspension issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on the component and whether converting to coil springs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning power windows are sometimes reported. Symptoms include windows that won't roll up or down, intermittent operation, or slow movement.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty window motors, regulators, or switches. Check wiring for damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Navigation screens failing, freezing, or being unresponsive. Bluetooth connectivity issues or distorted sounds from speakers.
    * Solution: Could require software updates, fuse replacements, or replacement of the entire unit in some cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks around the sunroof or moonroof can occur, leading to water damage inside the cabin. This is often caused by clogged drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Clean and unclog the sunroof/moonroof drain tubes. Inspect and replace seals if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly.
    *   Solution: Could need a new motor, actuator, or sensor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Lincoln Navigator, while offering a luxurious and spacious experience, can present owners with several potential issues. The air suspension system and spark plug design are notable areas of concern, potentially leading to costly repairs.
