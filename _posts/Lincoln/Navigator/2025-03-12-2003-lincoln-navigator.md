The 2003 Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. Under the hood, you'll find a robust 5.4L InTech V8 engine, producing 300 horsepower and 355 lb-ft of torque. All models came equipped with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Navigator for its towing capacity and opulent features. However, common complaints include fuel economy, age-related mechanical issues, and the cost of repairs due to its complex systems.

**Engine**

**5.4L InTech V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2003 Navigator is known to have issues with spark plugs breaking upon removal. The engine is prone to carbon buildup in the spark plug wells, which causes the plugs to seize. When attempting to remove them, the spark plugs will break off, leaving the threaded portion stuck in the cylinder head. This is a specific problem for the 2003 model year due to the cylinder head design and spark plug design.
    *   Solution: Removal requires specialized tools and techniques, often involving drilling and extraction. In some cases, the cylinder head needs to be removed and sent to a machine shop. Applying penetrating oil and working carefully can help minimize breakage, but is often unsuccessful.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the number of plugs broken and the need for cylinder head removal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold is prone to cracking, leading to vacuum leaks, rough idling, and potential engine misfires. This can also cause coolant leaks if the cracks extend to the coolant passages.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, and difficulty starting can occur due to a faulty IAC valve. This valve regulates the amount of air entering the engine at idle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report delayed engagement of gears, particularly when shifting from park to drive or reverse. Harsh shifts between gears are also a common complaint.
    *   Solution: Often requires a transmission flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body issues or worn clutches may necessitate a rebuild or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a flush and filter change, $2000 - $4000+ for a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds or during acceleration can indicate torque converter failure. In more severe cases, the transmission may slip or fail to engage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, often recommended to be done in conjunction with a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system is prone to leaks and compressor failures, leading to a sagging ride height, a bumpy ride, and an "air suspension" warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the air struts, air compressor, and/or air lines. Many owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension to eliminate these issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per air strut, $300 - $800+ for the air compressor. Coil spring conversion kits range from $800 - $1500 installed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint and Control Arm Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering can indicate worn ball joints and control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints and/or control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuators control the flow of hot and cold air to the vents. Failure of these actuators can result in one side of the vehicle blowing hot air while the other blows cold air, or no temperature control at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per actuator.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to go up or down.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Running Board Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power running boards may fail to extend or retract properly, or may make grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the running board motor or entire running board assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, leak, or make excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of sunroof components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Lincoln Navigator presents a mix of age-related issues. The engine is especially prone to the infamous spark plug breaking issue that can cause very expensive repairs. Transmission issues can also be costly, as can the air suspension system. The electrical and interior problems are less severe but can still impact the overall driving experience. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing this model year.
