Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 Lincoln Navigator, formatted as requested. The 2014 Lincoln Navigator is a large luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong towing capability. All 2014 Navigators came standard with a 5.4-liter V8 engine producing 310 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Navigator's smooth ride, spaciousness, and upscale features. Common dislikes include its relatively poor fuel economy compared to newer SUVs, and some reliability concerns due to its age.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage/Ejection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton engine, while known for its durability, is notorious for spark plugs breaking during removal or even ejecting from the cylinder head. This is often due to the aluminum cylinder head design and limited threads holding the spark plugs. Symptoms include misfires, rough idling, and a ticking noise if a plug ejects.
    *   Solution: Careful spark plug removal using specialized tools and techniques (like soaking with penetrating oil) can sometimes prevent breakage. If a plug breaks, extraction tools are needed. If threads are damaged, a thread repair insert (like a Time-Sert) is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the number of plugs and thread repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The variable valve timing (VVT) system, specifically the cam phasers, can wear out or fail. Symptoms include a rattling noise, especially on startup, rough idle, reduced power, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers and potentially related components like timing chains, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifolds are prone to cracking or warping, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking or hissing noise, especially on cold starts, reduced fuel economy, and a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifolds and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6R80 transmission can develop issues with delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between certain gears. This may be due to valve body wear, solenoid issues, or internal clutch pack problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause. Possible solutions include valve body replacement, solenoid replacement, or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+ (depending on severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter shudder, a vibration felt during light acceleration or cruising, can occur. This is often caused by degradation of the torque converter's friction lining.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter and potentially a transmission flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Navigator's air suspension system is prone to issues, especially as the vehicle ages. Symptoms include sagging, uneven ride height, compressor failure, and error messages. Air springs (air bags) can leak, and the compressor can fail due to overwork.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the faulty component. Possible solutions include replacing the air springs, compressor, height sensors, or air lines. Conversion to coil springs is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the component and if converting to coil springs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door lock actuators can fail, preventing doors from locking or unlocking properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SYNC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC infotainment system can experience various problems, including freezing, slow response, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and screen malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, replacement of the SYNC module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts that support the rear liftgate can weaken and fail, causing the liftgate to droop or slam shut.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Heated/Cooled Seat Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heated and cooled seats can malfunction, either not heating/cooling properly or becoming excessively hot/cold.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause. Possible solutions include replacing the heating/cooling elements or the control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Lincoln Navigator can present several potential issues. The most concerning and potentially costly are related to the engine (spark plug issues, cam phasers), transmission (shifting problems, torque converter), and air suspension. Electrical issues like power door locks and SYNC problems can also be frustrating. While many of these issues are common in older vehicles with higher mileage, they are important to be aware of before purchasing a used 2014 Navigator. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for more extensive work like engine or transmission overhauls.
