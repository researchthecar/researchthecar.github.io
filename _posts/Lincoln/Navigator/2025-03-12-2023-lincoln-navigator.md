**Engine**

**3.5L Twin-Turbo V6 EcoBoost**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illuminated. Often related to faulty ignition coils or spark plugs, especially at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils and/or spark plugs. Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the affected cylinder is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the number of coils and plugs replaced and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Intrusion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant intrusion into the engine oil system. This can be caused by a faulty cylinder head, where coolant passages are breached. This can manifest as white, milky substance in the oil fill, or a sweet smell from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacement of cylinder head. Some instances may require engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (10R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, especially at lower speeds. Hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or TCM (Transmission Control Module) reprogramming may resolve the issue. However, if the problem persists, it could indicate wear or damage to internal transmission components, such as valve body issues or CDF drum failure. Valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for software update. $1,000 - $3,000+ for valve body or internal component replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping, RPMs rising without corresponding increase in speed, difficulty accelerating.
    *   Solution: This could be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or a faulty torque converter. Requires thorough diagnosis by a qualified transmission technician.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid top off if it is low, $2,000-$6,000+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air suspension not maintaining ride height, sagging on one side, "Check Air Suspension" warning light. Can be caused by leaks in air springs, a faulty air compressor, or a malfunctioning height sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the source of the leak or malfunction. Replacement of air springs, compressor, or height sensor as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per air spring, $500 - $1,500+ for air compressor replacement, $200 - $500+ for height sensor replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Adaptive Suspension Dampers Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough ride, diminished handling, error message related to suspension.
    *   Solution: Damper replacement. Requires proper calibration after installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or experiences intermittent glitches. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates, performing a "master reset" of the system, or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) to $500 - $2,000+ (for unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver Assistance Features Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, or blind-spot monitoring systems failing to operate correctly or displaying error messages. Can be caused by sensor obstruction, software glitches, or faulty modules.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of sensors, software updates, or replacement of the affected module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 for recalibration, $300 - $1,500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Running Boards Not Deploying/Retracting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power running boards fail to extend or retract properly, making entry and exit difficult.
