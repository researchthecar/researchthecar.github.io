### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Lincoln Navigator is a capable full-size SUV with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly its powertrain. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the 5.4L V8 engine, specifically concerning camshaft phasers and spark plug extraction, which can be costly repairs. The automatic transmission, while generally reliable, can experience torque converter or fluid leak problems. The advanced suspension system, especially the air suspension, is a common source of repair needs, with compressor failures being notable. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module or infotainment system, can also arise. Exterior features like power running boards and interior climate control components like blend door actuators are also areas where repairs may be necessary. Despite these potential issues, many Navigators continue to provide reliable service with proper maintenance and timely attention to reported problems.
