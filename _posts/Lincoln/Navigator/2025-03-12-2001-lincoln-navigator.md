The 2001 Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful V8 engine. For 2001, the Navigator was offered with a single engine option: the 5.4L Triton V8, which produced 300 horsepower and 355 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Navigator for its smooth ride, ample cargo space, and luxurious features. Common complaints often revolved around fuel economy, overall size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and some reliability concerns related to its age.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can loosen or eject from the cylinder head due to weak aluminum threads. This can cause misfires, loss of power, and a ticking noise.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with thread inserts (like Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on repair method and whether the head needs replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold can crack, leading to vacuum leaks. Symptoms include rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission may slip between gears, exhibit harsh or delayed shifting, or fail to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: The 4R100 is generally reliable. The most common solution for slipping and harsh shifting is a transmission rebuild or replacement. Sometimes a valve body replacement may resolve shifting issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ for valve body, $1500 - $4000+ for rebuild/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can fail, resulting in a saggy or uneven ride height. This can be caused by leaks in the air springs (bags), a faulty compressor, or a bad height sensor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air springs, compressor, or height sensors. Conversion to a coil-spring suspension is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per air spring, $400 - $800+ for compressor, $100 - $300+ per height sensor, $1000 - $3000+ for coil-spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuator controls the temperature of the air coming from the vents. When it fails, it can cause the HVAC system to blow only hot or cold air, or to switch between temperatures erratically. Often accompanied by a clicking sound behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate or operate intermittently. This is often due to a worn or faulty window motor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Running Board Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic running boards may fail to deploy or retract, or they may operate intermittently. This is often due to a faulty motor or damaged linkage.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the running board motor and/or linkage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, fail to open or close properly, or leak.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Lincoln Navigator can be a comfortable and capable SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues associated with this model year. The most prevalent issues revolve around the engine (spark plugs and intake manifold), transmission, and air suspension. Electrical issues like blend door actuator and power window motor failures are also fairly common. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or air suspension overhauls, can be quite costly. Overall, due to the vehicle's age, potential buyers should factor in the possibility of needing to address several of these issues, which could result in moderate to high repair costs.
