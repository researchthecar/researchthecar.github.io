The 3.5L EcoBoost V6 and 10-speed automatic transmission are robust and have not shown widespread issues. However, potential owners should be aware of the adaptive air suspension, which can be a source of costly repairs if leaks or compressor failures occur. Electrical gremlins, specifically with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted concerns that may require attention. Exterior and interior components are largely free of significant reported problems. Overall, while not immune to issues, the Navigator's reliability is competitive for its class, with most concerns being manageable or related to specific luxury features.
