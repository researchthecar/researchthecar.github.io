The 2007 Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and powerful V8 engine. For this model year, the Navigator was only offered with a single engine and transmission option: the 5.4L 3V Triton V8 and the ZF 6HP26 6-speed automatic transmission. The 5.4L V8 produced 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciated the Navigator's comfortable seating, ample cargo space, and towing capability. However, common complaints often revolved around its large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, poor fuel economy, and occasional electrical issues.

**Engine**

**5.4L 3V Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plugs Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs are known to seize in the cylinder heads, and often break off during removal. This is due to the plug's unique two-piece design and corrosion between the steel plug body and the aluminum cylinder head. Symptoms include a ticking or misfiring engine if a spark plug fails before removal, and difficulty removing the spark plugs during maintenance.
    *   Solution: Special extraction tools are available to remove broken spark plug pieces. Some mechanics recommend using penetrating oil and patience during removal. Applying anti-seize compound on the new spark plugs is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on how many plugs break and the labor involved).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cam phasers control the variable valve timing system. Over time, they can wear out or fail, leading to a rough idle, engine ticking or knocking noise, loss of power, and potential stalling. This often occurs because the oil passages that lubricate the phasers become clogged, starving the phasers of the proper amount of oil.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chains, chain guides, and tensioners. Some recommend replacing the oil pump as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold studs are prone to breaking, causing exhaust leaks. This results in a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, and can also lead to a decrease in fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken studs and potentially the exhaust manifold gasket. In some cases, the entire exhaust manifold may need to be replaced if it is warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF 6HP26 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ZF 6HP26 transmission can experience slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, and overall erratic behavior. This can be caused by worn valve body components, low fluid level, or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and fluid change using the correct fluid specification (typically Mercon SP or Mercon LV) can sometimes resolve minor issues. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, vibration, and potential stalling. This can be caused by internal wear or damage to the torque converter clutch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter is typically the only solution. It's often recommended to flush the transmission and replace the filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor is responsible for maintaining the correct ride height. If the compressor fails, the vehicle may sag or bottom out, especially in the rear. Other symptoms include the "check air suspension" warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor. It's also important to check for leaks in the air lines and air springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Spring Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air springs can develop leaks over time, causing the vehicle to sag or lean to one side. This can lead to a rough ride and potential damage to the air suspension compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air spring(s). Some owners choose to convert to a conventional coil spring suspension to avoid future air suspension problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per air spring / $1,000 - $2,500+ for coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuators control the flow of hot and cold air in the HVAC system. When they fail, it can result in one side of the vehicle blowing hot air while the other blows cold air, or a complete loss of heating or cooling. A clicking sound from behind the dashboard is also a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blend door actuator(s). This can be a labor-intensive job, as the actuators are often located in hard-to-reach areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on location of actuator and labor involved).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows and door locks. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, door lock actuator, or wiring problems within the door harness.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window motor or door lock actuator. Inspecting and repairing any damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per window/door lock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the instrument cluster, such as dim or flickering displays, inaccurate readings, or complete failure. This can be caused by a faulty circuit board or other internal component failure.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster. Some repair shops specialize in instrument cluster repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Running Board Motor Failure (Power Running Boards)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power running boards may fail to extend or retract properly. This is often due to a faulty motor, damaged linkage, or corrosion.
    *   Solution: Replacing the running board motor, linkage, or the entire running board assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, leak, or make excessive noise during operation. This can be caused by a faulty motor, damaged tracks, or clogged drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks and drain tubes. Repairing or replacing the sunroof motor or damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Lincoln Navigator, while a luxurious and capable SUV, has its share of common issues. Engine problems, particularly with spark plug removal and cam phaser failure, can be costly to repair. Air suspension issues are also prevalent and can lead to significant expenses if not addressed promptly. Electrical gremlins, such as blend door actuator and instrument cluster failures, are also common. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the vehicle's condition. Budgeting for potential repairs, especially to the engine and suspension systems, is essential. The severity of issues varies, but the potential for high repair costs is definitely a factor to consider.
