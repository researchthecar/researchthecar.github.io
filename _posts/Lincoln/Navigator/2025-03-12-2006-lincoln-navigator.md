Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2006 Lincoln Navigator, organized by category and component, adhering to your specified format.

The 2006 Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capability. It came standard with a 5.4L Triton V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciate its plush ride, luxurious features, and ample space, some common complaints revolve around its fuel economy, reliability of certain components, and the cost of repairs.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The spark plug threads in the cylinder head can strip or break, causing spark plugs to eject from the engine. This results in a loud popping noise, misfires, and a significant loss of power. It often occurs when removing or installing spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) is a common solution. In severe cases, the cylinder head may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+, depending on the severity and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The variable valve timing (VVT) system, specifically the cam phasers, can wear or fail. This leads to a ticking or rattling noise, especially at idle or low speeds, rough idling, reduced engine performance, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks or warping of the exhaust manifolds, often near the exhaust ports. This results in a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, which may diminish as the engine warms up. It can also lead to reduced fuel economy and a potential exhaust smell inside the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifolds and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R60/6R75)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, particularly when cold. Slipping during acceleration, where the engine revs higher than expected without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush *may* help in some cases, but often the issue requires more extensive repair. Valve body replacement, torque converter replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations, especially at lower speeds, or when the torque converter locks up. Stalling, or difficulty shifting into gear.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can fail, causing the vehicle to sag on one or more corners, ride harshly, or display error messages on the dashboard. Components that commonly fail include the air compressor, air struts/springs, and height sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air suspension components. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per corner for air suspension repair; $1500 - $3000+ for a complete coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking, popping, or clunking noises coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Loose or wandering steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The climate control system blows hot air on one side and cold air on the other, or vice versa. Clicking noises behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blend door actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per actuator, depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days, even with the vehicle turned off. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module, wiring issue, or a failing alternator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing individual circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for diagnosis; repair costs vary depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster, flickering lights, inaccurate readings.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Running Board Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power running boards may fail to extend or retract properly, or may become stuck in one position. This can be caused by motor failure, corrosion, or damaged hinges.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the power running boards, including cleaning and lubricating moving parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per side, depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof/moonroof may leak, fail to open or close properly, or make excessive noise during operation. This can be caused by motor failure, damaged seals, or broken tracks.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof/moonroof components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2006 Lincoln Navigator, while offering luxury and space, has several common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems like spark plug thread failure and cam phaser issues can be costly to repair. The air suspension is another area of concern, with potential for expensive repairs or conversion to a traditional suspension. Electrical glitches, such as blend door actuator failure and battery drain issues, also contribute to the vehicle's overall maintenance burden. While some issues may be minor, others can result in significant repair costs, so a thorough inspection before purchase is highly recommended.
