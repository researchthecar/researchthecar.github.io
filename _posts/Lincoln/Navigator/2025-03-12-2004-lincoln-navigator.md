**Engine**

**5.4L 2V SOHC Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage/Ejection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine is notorious for spark plugs seizing in the cylinder head, often resulting in damaged threads or the spark plug ejecting from the head. Symptoms include a ticking noise, misfires, and loss of power. This is more common on early production 2V heads.
    *   Solution: Repairing the damaged threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) is the most common solution. In severe cases, cylinder head replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the severity and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking/Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold is prone to cracking, especially around the coolant crossover passages. This leads to coolant leaks, which can cause overheating and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can result in shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. It is often recommended to flush the transmission and replace the filter during this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty shift solenoids can cause erratic shifting, failure to shift, or harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system is prone to leaks in the air springs (bags), compressor failure, and height sensor malfunctions. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting low, a constantly running air compressor, or uneven ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air springs, compressor, or height sensors. Some owners convert to a traditional coil spring suspension to avoid recurring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ per air spring/compressor; $1,000 - $3,000+ for coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ride Height Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Incorrect vehicle ride height, usually very low, caused by ride height sensors sending incorrect data to the suspension module.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty ride height sensor
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuators control the flow of hot and cold air in the HVAC system. Failure of these actuators can cause issues such as only hot air, only cold air, or inconsistent temperatures.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
