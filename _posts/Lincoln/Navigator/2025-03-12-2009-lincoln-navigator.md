Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2009 Lincoln Navigator, categorized as requested.

The 2009 Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capacity. It came equipped with a 5.4L Triton V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Navigator's roomy cabin, smooth ride, and upscale features. Common dislikes include its poor fuel economy, large size making it difficult to maneuver, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 engine is known for spark plugs breaking upon removal. The two-piece design of the spark plugs can separate, leaving part of the plug stuck in the cylinder head. This can lead to misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Special tools are often required to extract the broken spark plugs. In some cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed for more extensive repairs. Some owners recommend using specific anti-seize compounds on the new spark plugs to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the number of plugs that break and whether head removal is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioners and guides can wear out prematurely, leading to timing chain slap or rattle, especially upon cold starts. In severe cases, this can cause the timing chain to jump, resulting in significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially the phasers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cam phasers, part of the variable valve timing system, can fail. Symptoms include a knocking or rattling noise, especially at idle or low speeds, rough running, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, often along with the timing chain and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **6-Speed Automatic Transmission**
    * **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
        * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement with the 6-speed automatic transmission. This is caused by worn frictions, solenoid failures, or valve body issues.
        * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the transmission may involve replacing solenoids, valve body, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (for minor repairs) - $4000+ (for rebuild or replacement)
        * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can develop leaks in the air springs (bags), compressor failure, or problems with the height sensors. This results in a sagging vehicle, uneven ride height, and a bumpy ride. The "check suspension" light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air springs, compressor, or height sensors. Conversion to a traditional coil spring suspension is also an option, though it changes the ride characteristics.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per air spring, $500-$1000 for compressor, $1000 - $3000+ for coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows and door locks. This can be due to faulty window motors, door lock actuators, or wiring harness issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window motor or door lock actuator. Inspection and repair of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window/door lock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Radio Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with the navigation system, radio, or other infotainment features. These can include freezing, screen flickering, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the issue and solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, or may make unusual noises. This can be caused by a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty liftgate motor, struts, or latch mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks from the sunroof, often due to clogged drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

**Summary:**

The 2009 Lincoln Navigator can be a comfortable and capable SUV, but it's prone to several potentially costly issues, particularly related to the 5.4L Triton V8 engine (spark plugs, timing chain/phasers) and the air suspension system. Electrical issues and liftgate malfunctions are also relatively common. While some repairs are minor, others can be quite expensive, potentially reaching several thousand dollars.
