### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Lincoln Aviator presents a mixed reliability profile. The 4.6L V8 engine, while generally strong, is prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and spark plug blowout issues, which can be costly to repair. The 5R55W transmission can suffer from torque converter problems and overheating, requiring attention to prevent more significant damage. Suspension components, particularly the air suspension system and control arm bushings, are also noted areas for potential repair. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. While the exterior generally holds up well, interior components like the HVAC blower motor resistor can fail. Overall, prospective buyers should be prepared for potential maintenance costs related to these specific issues.
