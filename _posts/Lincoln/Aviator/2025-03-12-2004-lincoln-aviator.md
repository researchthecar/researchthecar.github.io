The 2004 Lincoln Aviator was a mid-size SUV based on the Ford Explorer platform, offering a more luxurious experience. It came standard with a 4.6L DOHC 32-valve V8 engine that produced 302 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. What people liked about the Aviator was its comfortable ride, powerful engine, and attractive styling. What people disliked was its poor fuel economy, cramped third-row seating, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**4.6L DOHC 32-valve V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can become loose or eject from the cylinder head due to insufficient thread engagement in the aluminum cylinder head. This can result in a misfire, loss of power, and a loud popping noise.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head. Common repair methods include installing thread inserts (e.g., Time-Sert or Helicoil).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold gasket can leak, causing a vacuum leak, rough idle, poor fuel economy, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (5R55S)**

*   **Valve Body Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body within the 5R55S transmission can experience wear and tear, leading to shifting problems such as harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. In some cases, just replacing the solenoid pack can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, stalling, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's often recommended to flush the transmission and replace the filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Aviator offered an optional air suspension system. Components like the air compressor, air springs, and ride height sensors can fail, leading to the vehicle sagging, a rough ride, or a "suspension fault" warning light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty components (air springs, compressor, ride height sensors, etc.). Some owners convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per component, conversion to coil springs can range from $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and looseness in the front lower ball joints causes clunking noises from the front end and steering issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the front lower ball joints
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuators control the flow of hot and cold air. Failure can lead to only hot or cold air blowing from the vents, or inconsistent temperature control.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per actuator
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster. This can include flickering lights, inaccurate readings, or complete loss of display.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The liftgate struts can weaken over time, causing the liftgate to droop or not stay open.
    *   Solution: Replace the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Lincoln Aviator, while offering a luxurious experience, has its share of potential problems. Engine issues such as spark plug thread failure and intake manifold gasket leaks can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the valve body and torque converter, can also be significant expenses. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension system, are common and can also be costly. Electrical issues like blend door actuator and instrument cluster failures can be irritating and moderately expensive to address. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a 2004 Lincoln Aviator. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended.
