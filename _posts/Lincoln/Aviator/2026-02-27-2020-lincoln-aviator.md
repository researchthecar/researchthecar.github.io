# 2020 Lincoln Aviator

### Overview
The 2020 Lincoln Aviator, a luxury SUV, offers a blend of performance and comfort. It is available with two primary powertrain configurations: a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 gasoline engine and a plug-in hybrid variant combining the 3.0L twin-turbo V6 with electric motors. While generally well-received for its upscale interior and smooth ride, like any vehicle, it has specific areas where owners have reported concerns. This analysis focuses on documented technical reliability issues, excluding routine maintenance and normal wear and tear, to provide a clear picture of potential long-term ownership considerations.

### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Lincoln Aviator presents a generally reliable luxury SUV experience, with most reported issues stemming from its advanced powertrain and suspension systems. Owners of the gasoline 3.0L twin-turbo V6 may encounter occasional coolant leaks or turbocharger concerns, while the plug-in hybrid variant can experience issues related to its complex hybrid system and battery cooling. The 10-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. The adaptive air suspension, while offering a superior ride, is more prone to leaks and compressor failures than a standard setup. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and factor in potential repair costs, especially for the hybrid components and air suspension.
