The 2005 Lincoln Aviator is a mid-size luxury SUV that was produced from 2003 to 2005. It came equipped with a single engine option: a 4.6L V8 engine, producing 302 horsepower and 318 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Aviator's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and stylish exterior. Common dislikes included its poor fuel economy, relatively bland interior compared to competitors, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head, causing a loud popping noise, misfire, and potential damage to the threads in the cylinder head. This is often attributed to the aluminum cylinder head thread design and can occur on other Ford vehicles with similar engine designs.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads using a thread repair kit (like a Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks developing from the intake manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, transmission slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, faulty shift solenoids, valve body issues, or internal damage to the transmission. Diagnosis is key. Fluid flush, solenoid replacement, valve body repair, or full transmission replacement are possible solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3500+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Aviator could be equipped with an air suspension system, which is prone to failure as the vehicle ages. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting low, uneven ride height, compressor failing to operate, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs (airbags), air suspension compressor, or ride height sensors. Converting to a traditional coil spring suspension is another option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the component needing replacement or conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning gauges, flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty component or wiring.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Cleaning and resealing the sunroof seal, or replacing the sunroof seal. Clearing the sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Lincoln Aviator, while offering a comfortable and stylish driving experience, is prone to several common issues. Engine issues like spark plug blowout and intake manifold failures can be costly to repair. The transmission may experience erratic shifting requiring a fluid flush or more costly overhaul/replacement. The air suspension system (if equipped) can also be a source of problems due to its age. Electrical issues and rust are also common concerns. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. Addressing these issues proactively with regular maintenance can help extend the life of the vehicle.
