**2004 Lincoln Aviator**

The 2004 Lincoln Aviator is a mid-size luxury SUV that was available with two different engine and transmission options:

* 4.6L V8 with a 5-speed automatic transmission (302 horsepower, 320 lb-ft of torque)
* 5.4L V8 with a 6-speed automatic transmission (310 horsepower, 365 lb-ft of torque)

The Aviator was praised for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and powerful engines. However, it has also been plagued by a number of issues over the years.

**Engine**

* **4.6L V8**
    * **Intake manifold runner control (IMRC) failure:** The IMRC system controls the flow of air into the engine. When the IMRC fails, it can cause a loss of power and fuel economy.
        * Solution: Replace the IMRC system.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
        * Recalls: NHTSA Campaign Number 05V204000
* **5.4L V8**
    * **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner keeps the timing chain tight. When the tensioner fails, it can cause the timing chain to skip, which can lead to catastrophic engine damage.
        * Solution: Replace the timing chain and tensioner.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
        * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **5-speed automatic transmission**
    * **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter is a fluid-filled device that helps to smooth out the transmission of power from the engine to the transmission. When the torque converter fails, it can cause the transmission to shudder or vibrate.
        * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
        * Recalls: None Found
* **6-speed automatic transmission**
    * **No major issues reported**

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension:**
    * **Ball joint failure:** The ball joints connect the control arms to the steering knuckles. When the ball joints fail, they can cause the front end of the vehicle to clunk or rattle.
        * Solution: Replace the ball joints.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
        * Recalls: None Found
* **Rear suspension:**
    * **Air suspension compressor failure:** The air suspension compressor provides air pressure to the rear air springs. When the compressor fails, the rear end of the vehicle can sag or become bouncy.
        * Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
        * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Electrical system:**
    * **Battery drain:** The Aviator's electrical system is known to be prone to battery drain. This can be caused by a number of factors, including faulty wiring, parasitic draws, or a weak battery.
        * Solution: Troubleshoot the electrical system to find the cause of the battery drain.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the cause of the battery drain.
        * Recalls: None Found

        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100
        * Recalls: None Found
