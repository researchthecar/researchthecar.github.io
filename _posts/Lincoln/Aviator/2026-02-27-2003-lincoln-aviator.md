### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Lincoln Aviator, while offering a luxurious experience, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly the 4.6L V8 engine's intake manifold gaskets and spark plug retention, as well as the 5R55W transmission's torque converter and potential for overheating. The suspension, especially models equipped with air suspension, can also be a source of costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, and premature alternator failure are also noted concerns. Despite these potential issues, many components are shared with the Ford Explorer, which can make parts availability and repair knowledge more accessible. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these reliability concerns.
