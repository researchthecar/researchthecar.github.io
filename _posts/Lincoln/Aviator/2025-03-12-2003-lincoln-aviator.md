The 2003 Lincoln Aviator was a mid-size luxury SUV based on the Ford Explorer platform, aiming to provide a more upscale experience. It was only offered with a single engine option, the 4.6L DOHC V8, producing around 302 horsepower and 318 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option was a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the Aviator's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and distinctive styling. Common criticisms included its fuel economy, reliability issues, and higher repair costs compared to its Ford counterpart.

**Engine**

**4.6L DOHC V8**

* **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can strip the threads in the aluminum cylinder heads, leading to a misfire, rough running, and potentially a blown-out spark plug. This is common on the 2V and 3V versions of this engine, but rare on the 4V DOHC version.
    * Solution: Repair the threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replace the cylinder head.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the repair method and whether one or both heads need repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Intake Manifold Cracking/Leaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold can crack, leading to vacuum leaks, rough idling, and poor performance. Coolant leaks are also common.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold with a new one, preferably one with updated materials.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioners can fail, leading to a rattling noise, especially on startup. If left unaddressed, it can lead to timing chain failure and engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioners, guides, and chains.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (5R55S)**

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping between gears, harsh shifting, and failure to shift. Commonly related to the solenoid pack or valve body bore wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the solenoid pack, valve body, or rebuilding the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $3000+ depending on the severity and repair method.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, stalling, or complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission. It's often recommended to rebuild the transmission at this point.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity and repair method.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can fail, leading to a sagging or uneven ride height, a harsh ride, and an "air suspension" warning light. This often stems from leaks in the air springs or compressor failure.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty air springs, compressor, or height sensors. Conversion to coil springs is also an option.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per corner for air suspension repair. Coil spring conversion can range from $800 - $1500.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ball Joint Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clicking, popping, or squeaking noises from the front suspension. Loose steering and uneven tire wear can also occur.
    * Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per ball joint.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gauges may malfunction, flicker, or stop working altogether. The display screen can also have issues.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

* **GEM (Generic Electronic Module) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: This module controls various electrical functions, and failure can lead to issues with power windows, door locks, interior lighting, and other systems.
    * Solution: Replace or reprogram the GEM.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary**

The 2003 Lincoln Aviator, while offering a luxurious ride and distinctive styling, is prone to several common issues that can be both costly and inconvenient to address. Engine problems, particularly spark plug thread issues and intake manifold leaks, are relatively common and can lead to significant repair bills. Transmission problems, especially valve body and torque converter failures, are another area of concern. Air suspension failures (if equipped), can add to the cost of ownership. Overall, the severity and cost of these common issues make it crucial for potential buyers to thoroughly inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potential maintenance and repair expenses.
