### Overview
The 2023 Lincoln Aviator presents itself as a luxurious and capable three-row SUV, aiming to blend performance with comfort.

Lincoln has generally focused on providing a refined driving experience and a premium interior. Reliability data for the 2023 model year is still emerging, but initial reports suggest a generally solid performance, with most common concerns revolving around specific electronic features or minor fit-and-finish issues rather than widespread mechanical failures.

Interior fit and finish are generally good, though isolated reports of minor rattles or seat adjustment issues exist. Overall, the Aviator offers a reliable luxury SUV experience, with most potential concerns being manageable and often covered under warranty.
