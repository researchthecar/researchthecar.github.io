### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Lincoln Aviator demonstrates good overall reliability, with its core powertrain components (3.0L V6 and hybrid system, 10-speed automatic transmission) showing no significant widespread issues. The most commonly cited technical concerns revolve around the optional Adaptive Air Suspension, which can experience compressor malfunctions, and occasional electrical gremlins within the infotainment system, often resolved by software updates. Premature battery drain has also been noted. These issues are not pervasive and do not detract significantly from the vehicle's otherwise solid mechanical foundation. Regular maintenance and addressing software updates promptly are recommended.
