### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Lincoln MKS presents a mixed reliability profile. The powertrain, particularly the 3.5L EcoBoost engine, can be susceptible to turbocharger and timing chain issues, while the 3.7L V6 may experience cooling system and oil leaks. Transmission problems like shuddering and leaks are also noted. Electrically, the MyLincoln Touch infotainment system is a common source of frustration with screen unresponsiveness and software glitches. Battery drain and door lock actuator failures are other potential concerns. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components generally show good reliability. Owners should be aware of these potential issues, especially when considering a used model, and factor in potential repair costs for the noted powertrain and electrical components.
