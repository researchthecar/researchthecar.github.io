The 2014 Lincoln MKS is a full-size luxury sedan that aimed to provide a comfortable and spacious ride. The available engine options included a 3.7L V6 producing 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 delivering 304 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the MKS for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and quiet cabin. However, common complaints centered around its outdated technology, underwhelming fuel economy (especially with the EcoBoost engine), and somewhat bland styling compared to some of its competitors.
