It is powered by a standard 3.7L V6 engine producing 304 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque, with an available 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 that cranks out 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. The MKS is available with either a 6-speed automatic transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, leading to engine oil loss. Fix involves replacing the gaskets. $200 - $400+
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Intake manifold gaskets fail, causing vacuum leaks and rough idling. Replacement of the gaskets is necessary. $300 - $500+
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Timing chain tensioner fails, resulting in rattling noises. Replacing the tensioner fixes the issue. $400 - $600+
* **Spark Plug Failure:** Spark plugs fail prematurely, leading to misfires and reduced engine performance. Replacement of the spark plugs is required. $100 - $200+

**3.5L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

* **Rear Turbocharger Failure:** Rear turbocharger fails, resulting in reduced engine power and a check engine light. Replacement of the turbocharger is necessary. $1,500 - $2,000+
