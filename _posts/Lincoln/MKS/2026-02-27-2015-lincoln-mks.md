### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Lincoln MKS presents a generally reliable profile, with most reported issues concentrated in the powertrain and electrical systems. The 3.7L V6 engine is less prone to significant problems than the more complex 3.5L EcoBoost, which can experience turbocharger and intake manifold issues. Transmission problems, while not universal, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SYNC infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. The exterior and interior components are largely free from widespread defects. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection, especially for models with the EcoBoost engine or higher mileage.
