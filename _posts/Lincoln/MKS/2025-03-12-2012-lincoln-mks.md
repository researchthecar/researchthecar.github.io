The 2012 Lincoln MKS is a full-size luxury sedan that aimed to provide a comfortable and refined driving experience. It was available with two engine options: a 3.7L V6 producing 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 generating 355 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the MKS for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available features. However, some criticisms included its somewhat bland styling, less engaging driving dynamics compared to some competitors, and reports of certain reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2012 Lincoln MKS can be a comfortable and well-equipped vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The 3.5L EcoBoost engine can suffer from turbocharger problems, which can be expensive to repair. The 6-speed transmission can have torque converter and slipping/harsh shifting issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the MyLincoln Touch system, are also frequently reported. Suspension and other issues can occur, but aren't as widespread as the issues related to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the specific problem.
