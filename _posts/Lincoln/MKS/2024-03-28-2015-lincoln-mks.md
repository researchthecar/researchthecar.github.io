**Introduction**

The 2015 Lincoln MKS is a full-size luxury sedan that offers a spacious cabin, a smooth ride, and plenty of power under the hood. It is powered by a standard 3.7-liter V6 engine that produces 304 horsepower and 279 pound-feet of torque. A 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 engine producing 330 horsepower and 370 pound-feet of torque is also available. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.
