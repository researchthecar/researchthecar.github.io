The 2015 Lincoln MKS is a full-size luxury sedan that aimed to provide a comfortable and refined driving experience. Engine options included a 3.7L V6 producing 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 generating 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praised the MKS for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and quiet cabin. Common complaints often centered around its somewhat dated styling compared to newer competitors, fuel economy, and the infotainment system.
