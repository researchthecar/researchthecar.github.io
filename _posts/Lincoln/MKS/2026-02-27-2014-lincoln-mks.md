### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Lincoln MKS demonstrates a generally good reliability record, particularly with the naturally aspirated 3.7L V6 engine. The more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6, while offering superior performance, has a higher propensity for issues related to its turbochargers and potential coolant leaks. Transmission problems, though not universal, can manifest as hesitation or shuddering, often requiring attention to fluid and potentially internal components. Electrical gremlins, especially with the SYNC infotainment system, and issues with blend door actuators in the climate control system are also noted. Owners should be mindful of these potential areas, but overall, the MKS remains a comfortable and capable luxury sedan when properly maintained.
