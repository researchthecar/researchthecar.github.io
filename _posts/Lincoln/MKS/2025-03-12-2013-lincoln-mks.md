Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2013 Lincoln MKS, categorized as requested.

The 2013 Lincoln MKS is a full-size luxury sedan that aimed to provide a comfortable and feature-rich driving experience. Engine options included a 3.7L V6 and a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6. The 3.7L engine produced 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. People generally liked the MKS for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and generous standard features. Criticisms often focused on its somewhat bland styling, less engaging driving dynamics compared to some competitors, and a perceived lack of brand prestige compared to European luxury marques. Both engine options were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
