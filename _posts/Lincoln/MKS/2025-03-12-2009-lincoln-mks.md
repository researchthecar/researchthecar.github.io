The 2009 Lincoln MKS was a full-size luxury sedan that aimed to blend comfort with a touch of performance. It was available with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 3.7L V6 producing 273 horsepower and 269 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost twin-turbocharged V6 generating 355 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the MKS for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and attractive styling. Common complaints include issues with the MyLincoln Touch infotainment system (although this system was not equipped on the 2009 model) and some reported reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. Engine may run rough and/or throw codes related to camshaft/crankshaft position correlation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially the cam phasers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke (blue/grey) from the exhaust, whistling noises from the engine bay, and potential engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger(s). It is recommended to replace both turbos at the same time to avoid future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on single vs. both turbos and shop rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Water Pump Failure (Internal)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking into the engine oil, overheating, engine misfires. This is caused by the water pump being located inside the engine block.
    * Solution: Requires extensive engine disassembly to replace the internal water pump. It is recommended to replace other wear items, such as timing components, while the engine is open.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation, particularly at lower speeds or during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. A transmission fluid flush may temporarily alleviate the issue, but it's unlikely to be a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably hard shifts between gears, or a delay when shifting, especially between Park/Reverse or Drive.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by a faulty valve body or solenoid pack within the transmission. Replacing the valve body or solenoid pack may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll during cornering, clunking noises when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front struts/shocks. It's generally recommended to replace both struts/shocks on the same axle at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (for a pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window fails to go up or down, or moves very slowly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard (battery light), difficulty starting the engine, or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found
* **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster display, inaccurate readings, or flickering lights.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door handle breaking or becoming difficult to operate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof gets stuck, makes excessive noise when opening/closing, or leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the sunroof mechanism (motor, tracks, seals). Repair or replacement of the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Lincoln MKS can be a comfortable and stylish sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of several common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the EcoBoost engine (turbo and water pump failures) and the transmission (torque converter shudder). Timing chain issues are prevalent in the 3.7L V6. Electrical and suspension problems, while less severe, can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Depending on the issue, repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, so a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
