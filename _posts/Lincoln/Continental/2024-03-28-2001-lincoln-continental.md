**Introduction**

The 2001 Lincoln Continental is a full-size luxury sedan that was offered with three engine options: a 3.0L V6, a 4.6L V8, and a 6.8L V10. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic for the V6 and a 5-speed automatic for the V8 and V10. The Continental was praised for its comfortable interior, smooth ride, and powerful engines, but it also received some criticism for its dated design and lack of modern features.
