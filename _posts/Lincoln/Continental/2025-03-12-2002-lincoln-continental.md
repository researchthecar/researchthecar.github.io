The 2002 Lincoln Continental is a full-size luxury sedan known for its smooth ride and comfortable interior. The sole engine option for the 2002 model year was the 4.6L InTech V8 engine, which produced 275 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Continental for its spaciousness, quiet cabin, and traditional luxury features. Common complaints often revolve around its aging technology, dated styling, and occasional reliability concerns typical of older vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.6L InTech V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original plastic intake manifold is prone to cracking, leading to coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage. Often, the coolant leaks are located near the front of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold with an updated version that addresses the weakness in the original design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The aluminum cylinder heads are known to have weak spark plug threads. Spark plugs can sometimes eject from the cylinder head, causing engine misfires and potential damage to the surrounding components.
    *   Solution: Repairing the spark plug threads using a thread repair kit or replacing the cylinder head if the damage is too extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or erratic idle, stalling, especially when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or harsh shifts. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, it could involve a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement, valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
