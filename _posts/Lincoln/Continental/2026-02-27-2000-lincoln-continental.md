### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Lincoln Continental offers a comfortable and luxurious driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues that can arise with age. The 4.6L V8 engine is generally robust, but intake manifold gaskets and spark plug issues are documented. The automatic transmission can experience torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Body Control Module and power windows, are not uncommon. Suspension components like the air suspension system and bushings can also require attention. Exterior paint and interior leather can show wear. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are repairable, and a well-maintained Continental can still be a pleasant vehicle.
