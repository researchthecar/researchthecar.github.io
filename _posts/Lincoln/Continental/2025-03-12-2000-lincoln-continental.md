**Engine**

**4.6L InTech V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or leaking in the intake manifold, leading to coolant leaks, rough idle, and potential overheating. A common symptom is coolant loss without any visible external leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold. Updated intake manifolds are available that address the weakness of the original design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $900+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Stripping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The aluminum cylinder heads are prone to spark plug thread stripping, especially during spark plug changes. This results in misfires, rough running, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with thread inserts (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the repair method and whether the cylinder head needs replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling Fan Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electric cooling fan motor can fail, leading to overheating, especially in warmer climates or during stop-and-go traffic.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cooling fan assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**
