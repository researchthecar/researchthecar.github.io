While most core mechanical components like the engine and transmission options (3.7L V6, 2.7L EcoBoost V6, 3.0L EcoBoost V6, and 6-speed automatic) show no significant widespread issues, some minor electrical gremlins can occur. These primarily involve the infotainment system, which may experience occasional glitches or connectivity problems, and a less common concern of intermittent battery drain. Suspension and exterior/interior components are largely free of reported widespread defects. Overall, the Continental offers a dependable ownership experience with the expectation of addressing minor electrical issues as they arise.
