The 2017 Lincoln Continental marked the return of a storied nameplate, aiming to blend luxury with American style. It offered three engine choices: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 (305 hp, 280 lb-ft of torque), a 2.7L Twin-Turbocharged V6 (335 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6 (400 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners praised the Continental's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and quiet cabin, and its retro-modern styling. Common complaints revolved around the complexity of the infotainment system, some build quality issues, and reported reliability concerns, particularly with electrical components and the door latch mechanism.

**Engine**

**3.0L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Engine Oil**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks into the engine oil. This can be identified by a milky residue on the oil filler cap or dipstick, or by a low coolant level. Overheating may also occur. Can lead to premature engine wear and potential engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the engine is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission experiences harsh or erratic shifts, particularly between certain gears. A noticeable clunking sound may be heard during shifting or when decelerating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the transmission valve body is necessary. Some have replaced the entire transmission, while others have had success rebuilding it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The doors fail to latch properly, or unlatch unexpectedly while driving. The "door ajar" warning light may illuminate even when the doors are closed. This can be a significant safety hazard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door latch assembly. Ford issued multiple recalls related to door latch issues across several models, and it is recommended to check if the Continental is included in any relevant safety campaigns.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: 18S07, 19S22, 20S15

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 3 infotainment system freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. Navigation, audio, and climate control functions may be affected.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Ford may resolve some issues. In more severe cases, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Poor Backup Camera Quality**
    * Description/Symptoms: Backup camera is blurry or has low visibility.
    * Solution: Replacement of the camera is often required
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin from the sunroof, typically during rain or car washes. May stain headliner.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Malfunctions (Multiple Way Adjustable Seats)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power seat adjustments fail to function correctly, or the seats get stuck in a certain position. This can be caused by motor failures, wiring issues, or issues with the seat control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the seat motors, wiring, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with the optional air suspension, components may fail, leading to a loss of ride height, a harsh ride, or warning lights on the dashboard. The air compressor, air struts, or ride height sensors may be the cause.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2017 Lincoln Continental presents a mix of luxury and potential problems. The door latch issues, addressed by recalls, pose safety concerns. The 3.0L engine's coolant intrusion issue is a serious and costly problem, as is air suspension failure. Electrical issues, such as infotainment system freezes, can be frustrating. Overall, potential buyers should have a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used 2017 Continental and be aware of the common issues and associated repair costs.
