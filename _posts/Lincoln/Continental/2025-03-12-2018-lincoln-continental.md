The 2018 Lincoln Continental is a full-size luxury sedan that aimed to blend classic American comfort with modern technology. Engine options included a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 (305 hp, 280 lb-ft of torque), a 2.7L Twin-Turbo V6 (335 hp, 380 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L Twin-Turbo V6 (400 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque).
