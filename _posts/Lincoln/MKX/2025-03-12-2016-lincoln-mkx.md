The 2016 Lincoln MKX marked the beginning of the MKX's second generation. It was generally praised for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and luxurious features. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of issues. Engine options included a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing 303 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 2.7L EcoBoost V6, boasting 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some common complaints from owners include issues with the infotainment system, specifically the MyLincoln Touch interface, and potential problems with the powertrain.
