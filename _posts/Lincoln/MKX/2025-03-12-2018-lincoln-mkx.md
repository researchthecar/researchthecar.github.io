Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Lincoln MKX, categorized and formatted as requested.

Two engine options were available: a 3.7L V6 producing 303 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque and a 2.7L Twin-Turbocharged V6 producing 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the MKX's comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and luxurious features. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated infotainment system (before the Nautilus refresh) and some reliability concerns.
