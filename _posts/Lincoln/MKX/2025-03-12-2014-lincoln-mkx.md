The 2014 Lincoln MKX is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was offered with two engine options: a 3.7L V6 producing 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. The 3.7L V6 was generally praised for its smooth power delivery, while the 2.0L offered better fuel economy. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the MKX for its quiet cabin, comfortable seats, and user-friendly technology. Common complaints include the MyLincoln Touch infotainment system's complexity and occasional reliability issues, as well as the vehicle's somewhat uninspired handling compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2014 Lincoln MKX, while offering a comfortable and luxurious experience, can present owners with a variety of issues. Engine oil leaks, transmission problems, and electrical glitches (particularly with the MyLincoln Touch system) are common concerns. Suspension component wear is also a factor to consider. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix (fluid flushes, minor seal replacements), others, like major engine or transmission repairs, can be costly. The severity of these potential problems varies, but it's important for prospective buyers to be aware of these common issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed. The turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 engine having catastrophic issues with coolant intrusion is a major concern, and will likely need a whole new engine which will cost $4,000-$8,000+.
