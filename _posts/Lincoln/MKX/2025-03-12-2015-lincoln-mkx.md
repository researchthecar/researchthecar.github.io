The 2015 Lincoln MKX is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV, offering a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. The 2015 MKX has two engine options available: a 3.7L V6 engine producing 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 engine producing 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the MKX for its quiet cabin, comfortable seats, and available technology features. However, some common complaints include the MyLincoln Touch infotainment system's complexity and occasional reliability issues, as well as some concerns about fuel economy and repair costs.
