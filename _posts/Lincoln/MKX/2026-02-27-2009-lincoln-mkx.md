### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Lincoln MKX presents a mixed reliability profile. The powertrain, particularly the 3.5L V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, can experience issues like coolant leaks, VCT system problems, and transmission shuddering, which can be costly to repair. Suspension components, such as control arm bushings, are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, including power window failures and infotainment system glitches, are not uncommon.
