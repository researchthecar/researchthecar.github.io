The 2019 Lincoln MKC is a compact luxury crossover SUV, known for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and stylish design. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.3L turbocharged four-cylinder generating 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
