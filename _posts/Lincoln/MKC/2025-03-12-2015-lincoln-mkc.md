The 2015 Lincoln MKC is a compact luxury crossover SUV that marked Lincoln's entry into a popular segment. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4 producing 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.3L EcoBoost inline-4 generating 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the MKC's stylish design, comfortable ride, and quiet cabin. Common complaints often revolve around the MyLincoln Touch infotainment system's responsiveness and occasional reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2015 Lincoln MKC presents a mix of potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly with the 2.0L EcoBoost (coolant intrusion, turbo failure), can be costly. Transmission issues like harsh shifting are also common and may require significant repairs. Electrical issues, especially with the MyLincoln Touch system, can be frustrating. While the MKC offers a luxurious driving experience, addressing these potential problems can lead to repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the severity of the issue.
