### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Lincoln MKC presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core mechanicals, particularly the 2.3L EcoBoost engine and standard chassis, appear robust, owners have reported issues with the 2.0L EcoBoost engine's cooling system and turbocharger, as well as the 6F35 automatic transmission's shifting behavior. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the SYNC infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. The interior and exterior components generally hold up well, with the exception of the HVAC blower motor. Prospective buyers should consider these potential repair costs and prioritize vehicles with a well-documented maintenance history.
