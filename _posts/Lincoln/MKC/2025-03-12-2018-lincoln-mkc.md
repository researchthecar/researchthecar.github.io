The 2018 Lincoln MKC is a compact luxury crossover SUV, offering a blend of comfort and technology. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4 producing 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque and a 2.3L Turbocharged inline-4 generating 285 horsepower and 305 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the MKC for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and stylish design, while some common complaints revolved around the infotainment system and relatively limited cargo space compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil additions between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks or underlying issues contributing to the consumption. Some cases require replacing piston rings or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.3L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling or whining noises from the engine bay, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation or delayed engagement when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. If not, a more involved repair like valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for software update, $800 - $3,000+ for hardware repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, uneven tire wear, and a bouncy or unstable ride.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn components, such as struts, shocks, control arms, and bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner (depending on the specific components needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 3 infotainment system may freeze, lag, or become unresponsive, requiring a system reboot.
    *   Solution: Performing a software update to the SYNC 3 system. If the problem persists, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update (if done yourself), $500 - $1,200+ for APIM replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, even when the car is not in use, resulting in difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the parasitic draw causing the battery drain, which could be due to a faulty module or electrical component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks into Tail Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation or water accumulation inside the tail light housings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the tail light assemblies or resealing them to prevent water intrusion.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof/Moonroof gets stuck, or doesn't fully open or close.
    *   Solution: Inspection and lubrication of the sunroof tracks and mechanism. If there are damaged components, the sunroof assembly might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2018 Lincoln MKC has a mix of potential issues, ranging from minor infotainment glitches to more significant engine and transmission concerns. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the chosen repair method. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to address (such as software updates), others can lead to substantial repair bills (such as engine or transmission rebuilds). The most concerning issues appear to be related to the engine, transmission and electrical systems, and potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems.
