The 2004 Lincoln LS is a mid-size luxury sedan that aimed to blend American comfort with European driving dynamics. It was available with two engine options: a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 232 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.9L Jaguar-derived V8 generating 280 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission (though the manual was rare, and primarily available with the V6). Owners generally appreciated the LS for its comfortable ride, stylish design, and relatively affordable price point for a luxury vehicle. Common dislikes included the complexity of its electronics, some reliability issues, and expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**3.0L Duratec V6**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, check engine light illumination. Often multiple coil packs fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200+ per coil pack depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor acceleration, hesitation, check engine light. The IMRC valve is designed to improve low-end torque. Failure can lead to reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the IMRC valve or the entire intake manifold assembly (depending on the severity and accessibility of the valve).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the chosen repair.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks onto exhaust manifolds, burning oil smell, low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. Can lead to severe engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioners and potentially the timing chains themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ due to the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light acceleration or while maintaining a steady speed, particularly at lower RPMs.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, or replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush - $150-$300, Torque converter replacement $600-$1200+.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays when shifting gears, or shifts that feel harsh and abrupt.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition, perform a transmission flush, or replace valve body solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000+ depending on the chosen repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting low, inability to raise the suspension, "Check Suspension" light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ depending on the compressor brand and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Air Spring Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting low, hissing sound from the suspension, uneven ride height.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ per air spring depending on brand and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per pair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges flickering or not working, display screen malfunctioning, intermittent power loss to the cluster.
    *   Solution: Resolder connections on the instrument cluster circuit board, or replace the entire instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ depending on repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Lighting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights, taillights, or interior lights failing or flickering. Can be caused by faulty bulbs, wiring issues, or a failing lighting control module.

**Summary**
The 2004 Lincoln LS can be a comfortable and stylish vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of several common issues. Engine problems like coil pack failure (V6) and valve cover leaks or timing chain tensioner issues (V8) can lead to moderate to high repair costs. Suspension issues with the air suspension system (if equipped) are also a significant concern. Electrical issues, particularly with the instrument cluster, can be frustrating to deal with. Overall, potential owners should budget for potential repairs and maintenance to keep the vehicle running reliably.
