The 2003 Lincoln LS is a mid-size luxury sedan that offered a blend of comfort and performance. It came with two engine options: a 3.0L DOHC V6 producing 232 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.9L DOHC V8 generating 280 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were initially paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, though later models offered a Getrag 5-speed manual transmission with the V6. Owners appreciated the LS for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and European-inspired handling. Common complaints often centered around electrical issues, complex electronic systems that could be prone to failure, and the relatively high cost of repairs due to the car's luxury nature.

**Summary**

The 2003 Lincoln LS, while stylish and enjoyable to drive, suffers from a number of common issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the instrument cluster and GEM module, are prevalent and can be costly to repair. Suspension issues, especially with the air suspension (if equipped), and engine issues like coil pack failures and valve cover gasket leaks, also contribute to the car's maintenance burden. Transmission issues can be significant, and the potential for torque converter failure warrants careful inspection. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and the costs can quickly add up, making thorough pre-purchase inspections and ongoing maintenance crucial for ownership.
