The 2006 Lincoln LS is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its blend of comfort and sporty handling. It came with two engine options: a 3.0L DOHC V6 producing 232 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.9L DOHC V8 delivering 280 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the LS for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and distinctive styling. However, common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and some engine components.

**Engine**

**3.0L DOHC V6**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light. The engine may shake or run poorly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s). It is often recommended to replace all coil packs at the same time to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200+ per coil pack, depending on labor and part quality.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, especially at higher RPMs. A check engine light may illuminate with codes related to the IMRC system.
    *   Solution: Replace the IMRC valve or solenoid, or repair any vacuum leaks associated with the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+, depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.9L DOHC V8**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell and potential smoke. Oil levels may decrease over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+, depending on labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks (Timing Cover Area)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, often originating from the front of the engine near the timing cover. This can lead to overheating and engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: This often requires a reseal of the timing cover and/or replacement of gaskets and seals in the area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+, due to the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid. In severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2500+, depending on the extent of the damage and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission fluid leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leaks and potential hard shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the pan gasket, filter, and fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, failure to maintain ride height, error messages on the dashboard, and a noisy or failing air compressor. The air suspension may also leak.
    *   Solution: Replace the air springs/bags, air compressor, or height sensors. Convert to a coil spring suspension for a more reliable, but less luxurious, ride.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air spring replacement: $300 - $800+ per spring. Compressor replacement: $400 - $1000+. Coil spring conversion: $800 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps. Vague steering and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the lower control arms or, if possible, just the bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side, depending on whether just bushings or the entire arm is replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster may malfunction, displaying incorrect readings, flickering, or completely failing. This can affect the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, and other vital information.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+, depending on the repair method and shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Lincoln LS, while offering a luxurious experience, is prone to several common issues. Electrical problems, suspension issues (especially with the air suspension), and certain engine and transmission components are the primary areas of concern. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue, but several problems can result in fairly high repair bills. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems. Due to the age of the vehicle, preventative maintenance and regular inspections are recommended.
