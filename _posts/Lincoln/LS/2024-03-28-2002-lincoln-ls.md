**Introduction**
The 2002 Lincoln LS was a luxury sedan that debuted the carmaker's new retro styling. Lincoln offered the LS with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 3.0-liter V6 that produced 220 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Buyers could opt for the higher-powered 3.9-liter V8, which made 252 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. Both engines came standard with a five-speed automatic transmission. A six-speed manual transmission was available as an option for the V8 engine.

The LS received praise for its stylish design and comfortable interior. However, some owners have reported mechanical issues with the car, particularly with the V8 engine and transmission.
