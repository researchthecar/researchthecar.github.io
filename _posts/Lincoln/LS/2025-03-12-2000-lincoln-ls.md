The 2000 Lincoln LS was introduced as a luxury sedan aimed at competing with European sports sedans. It was available with two engine options: a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 210 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.9L Jaguar-derived V8 producing 252 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the LS for its comfortable ride, responsive handling, and stylish design. Common complaints include electrical issues, particularly with the instrument cluster and climate control, as well as concerns about the longevity of certain engine and transmission components.
