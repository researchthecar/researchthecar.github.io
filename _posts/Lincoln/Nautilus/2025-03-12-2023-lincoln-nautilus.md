The 2023 Lincoln Nautilus is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and elegant styling. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L twin-turbocharged V6 engine delivering 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Nautilus's quiet cabin, user-friendly technology, and upscale features. Some criticisms include the lack of driver engagement compared to sportier rivals and the sometimes-complicated infotainment system.

    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and consulting with a Lincoln dealer for diagnosis, which may include oil consumption testing and possible component replacement (e.g., piston rings, valve seals).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the cause and extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with air suspension, some owners have reported premature failure of the air struts or compressor. This can result in a lowered ride height, uneven suspension, and a bumpy ride.

    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the vehicle's battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Inspecting the electrical system for parasitic drains, replacing the battery with a higher-capacity unit, or installing a battery maintainer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (diagnosis/battery replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The parking sensors or blind spot monitoring system may occasionally malfunction, providing false alerts or failing to detect objects. This can be caused by dirt, debris, or faulty sensors.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the sensors, inspecting the wiring, or replacing the faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (per sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Loose or Rattling Trim Pieces**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported loose or rattling trim pieces in the interior, particularly in the dashboard, door panels, or center console.

**Summary**

The 2023 Lincoln Nautilus appears to have a mix of minor and potentially more serious issues. While some problems like infotainment glitches and rattling trim are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, engine issues like coolant intrusion and excessive oil consumption can be costly and require extensive repairs. Transmission issues and air suspension failures (if equipped) can also lead to significant expenses. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect any used Nautilus before purchasing it. Paying close attention to maintenance records and obtaining a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
