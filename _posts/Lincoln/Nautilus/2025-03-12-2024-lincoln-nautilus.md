Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2024 Lincoln Nautilus, categorized by vehicle component, and formatted as requested.

The 2024 Lincoln Nautilus represents a significant redesign for the model. It comes standard with a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid powertrain is also available, combining a 2.0L turbocharged engine with an electric motor, producing a combined 310 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Nautilus is generally praised for its luxurious interior, smooth ride, and advanced technology. However, some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the infotainment system, reliability concerns related to newer technology features, and occasionally, the responsiveness of the base engine.
