### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Lincoln Nautilus generally presents a reliable ownership experience, particularly for its luxury segment. The most frequently reported technical concerns tend to be related to the powertrain, specifically minor coolant leaks or turbocharger issues with the 2.0L EcoBoost, and oil leaks or engine mount wear with the 2.7L V6. The 8-speed automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit shifting irregularities. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted. However, these issues are not universally experienced and often fall within the expected range for a vehicle of this age and complexity. Routine maintenance and addressing these potential issues promptly should ensure continued reliability.
