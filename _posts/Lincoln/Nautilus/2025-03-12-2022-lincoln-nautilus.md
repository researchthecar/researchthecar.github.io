The 2022 Lincoln Nautilus is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 250 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L twin-turbocharged V6 delivering 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Nautilus's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and upscale features. Common criticisms include its somewhat uninspired handling compared to sportier rivals, and the potential for higher repair costs associated with its luxury status.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently, a burning oil smell, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: There's no single definitive fix. Some have had success with piston ring replacement, valve seal replacement, or replacing the PCV valve. A thorough inspection is needed to determine the source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

*   **Coolant Intrusion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have found coolant leaking internally in the engine which can cause major issues. Symptoms include white exhaust, a loss of coolant, milky look to engine oil, and rough engine operation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the engine is often the only effective solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $10,000+

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifts, particularly between lower gears, or noticeable delays when shifting.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (Software Update); $1,000 - $3,000 (Valve Body/Transmission Replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: For models equipped with air suspension, some owners have reported failures of the air struts or compressor, leading to a sagging vehicle or inability to adjust ride height. This is more common in colder climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected air strut(s) or compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut (depending on location and labor).

    *   Solution: Sometimes a simple system reset or software update can resolve minor glitches. More persistent issues may require a replacement of the APIM (accessory protocol interface module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (System Reset/Update); $500 - $1,500+ (APIM Replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced instances of the vehicle's battery draining overnight or over a few days of non-use. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**
