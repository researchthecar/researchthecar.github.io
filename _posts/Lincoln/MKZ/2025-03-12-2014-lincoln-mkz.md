The 2014 Lincoln MKZ is a mid-size luxury sedan that was offered with several powertrain options. The most common engine is the 2.0L EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder, producing 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. Other options include a 3.7L V6 producing 300 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Atkinson cycle four-cylinder hybrid powertrain. All non-hybrid engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid uses a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the MKZ's comfortable ride, stylish design, and available technology features. Common dislikes include the MyLincoln Touch infotainment system, which was known for being laggy and complicated, as well as some concerns about reliability.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (Software Update), $500 - $1200 (APIM Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, even when the car is not in use, leading to difficulty starting.
    * Solution: Identify and replace the faulty component causing the parasitic drain. This could be a faulty module, improperly installed aftermarket accessories, or a malfunctioning sensor.

**Summary**

The 2014 Lincoln MKZ presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. The most common and potentially costly issues are related to the 2.0L EcoBoost engine, specifically coolant intrusion and turbocharger failure, which can lead to significant repair bills. Electrical problems with the MyLincoln Touch system and exterior door handle failures are also prevalent. While some issues, like suspension noise, are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like engine or transmission replacements, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing.
