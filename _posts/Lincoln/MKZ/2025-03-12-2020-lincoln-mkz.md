**Electric Motor**

**2.0L Hybrid**

*   **Reduced Hybrid Battery Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Drivers report a decrease in the battery's ability to hold a charge over time, resulting in shorter all-electric driving ranges. The hybrid system may rely more heavily on the gasoline engine, reducing fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Hybrid battery replacement or reconditioning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on battery condition and service provider).

**Braking System**

**Regenerative Braking System (Hybrid Model)**

*   **Inconsistent Braking Feel**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers experience an inconsistent or "grabby" braking feel, especially during the transition between regenerative braking and traditional friction braking. This can make smooth stops challenging.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration of the braking system, inspection of brake components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 3 infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, climate controls, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software update, system reset, or replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (APIM replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may fail to display an image, show a distorted image, or become completely inoperative.
    *   Solution: Camera replacement, wiring repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
