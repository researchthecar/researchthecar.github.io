The 2013 Lincoln MKZ marked a significant redesign for the model, aiming for a more luxurious and technologically advanced experience. Available with a 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4 engine (240 hp, 270 lb-ft of torque), a 3.7L V6 engine (300 hp, 277 lb-ft of torque), and a hybrid option combining a 2.0L inline-4 with an electric motor, the MKZ catered to a broad spectrum of buyers. Some owners appreciated the MKZ's distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and available features. Common complaints revolved around the MyLincoln Touch infotainment system, reliability issues, and some interior material quality concerns.
