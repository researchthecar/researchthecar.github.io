The 2018 Lincoln MKZ is a mid-size luxury sedan offering a blend of comfort and style. It came with several powertrain options: a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, a 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6, and a 2.0L four-cylinder hybrid powertrain. The 2.0L turbo four-cylinder produced 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, providing adequate power for most drivers. The 3.0L twin-turbo V6, available with all-wheel drive, was the most powerful option, delivering 400 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the MKZ's quiet cabin, comfortable ride, and elegant interior. However, some criticisms include the somewhat uninspired styling compared to its competitors and the less engaging driving experience. The reliability of the MKZ can vary, with some owners reporting few issues while others experience more significant problems.
