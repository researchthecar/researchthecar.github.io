### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Lincoln MKZ presents a generally reliable profile, with most reported issues falling into the category of common automotive concerns rather than systemic failures. The powertrain, particularly the hybrid variant, shows good resilience. The primary areas of concern for the gasoline engine models involve potential coolant leaks and turbocharger issues, which can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, such as hesitation or shuddering, have also been noted and may require software updates or internal servicing. Electrical gremlins, especially with the SYNC infotainment system and intermittent battery drain, are present and can be frustrating for owners. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread reliability complaints. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and ensure regular maintenance to mitigate risks.
