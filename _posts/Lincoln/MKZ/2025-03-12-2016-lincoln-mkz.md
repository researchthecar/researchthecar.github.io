Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints associated with the 2016 Lincoln MKZ, organized by category and specific engine/transmission configurations:

The 2016 Lincoln MKZ is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride and stylish design. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, a 3.7L V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor producing a combined 188 horsepower in the Hybrid model.

**Summary**

The 2016 Lincoln MKZ has a mix of potential issues. Engine problems, specifically coolant intrusion in the 2.0L Turbo and misfires in the hybrid, can be costly. Transmission issues, though less frequent, can also be expensive to repair. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system are a common annoyance. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, it's important to be aware of them when considering a used 2016 Lincoln MKZ.
