The 2012 Lincoln MKZ is a mid-size luxury sedan that aimed to provide a comfortable and refined driving experience. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-4 engine producing 175 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 engine producing 263 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor in the hybrid model. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the MKZ for its comfortable ride, quiet interior, and available features. Common complaints included the dated infotainment system and lackluster fuel economy (particularly with the V6).

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating frequently, and visible blue smoke from the exhaust may occur.
    *   Solution: There isn't a single, universally accepted solution. Some have found success with using higher viscosity oil or performing an engine flush to remove potential sludge build-up. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (engine flush) - $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump can fail prematurely, leading to coolant leaks and potential engine overheating. Symptoms include coolant dripping from the front of the engine, the engine temperature gauge rising rapidly, and a sweet coolant smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump and coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or delayed shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "jerk" during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush may improve the shifting quality. In some cases, valve body issues may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $500 - $1500+ (valve body repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Suspension Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the need to replace suspension components like ball joints, tie rod ends, and control arm bushings sooner than expected. Symptoms include clunking noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component, depending on location and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MyLincoln Touch/MyFord Touch System Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This infotainment system was known for being slow, buggy, and unresponsive. Symptoms include freezing, crashing, inaccurate navigation, and difficulty pairing devices.
    *   Solution: Updating the system to the latest software version may provide some improvement. Replacement with an aftermarket unit is another option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update if available), $300 - $1000+ (aftermarket unit installation)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report that the vehicle is draining the battery faster than normal. This could be caused by a faulty module, like the SYNC module.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to replace the faulty module. Replacing the battery will help if the battery has been damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the sunroof malfunctioning, including getting stuck open or closed, or leaking water into the cabin.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, track, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Delaminating Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft-touch dashboard material can separate or bubble, creating an unsightly appearance. This is often caused by exposure to heat and sunlight.
    *   Solution: There is no permanent fix. Some owners have attempted to re-glue the material or cover the dashboard with a fabric protector. Complete dashboard replacement is possible but expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100 (temporary DIY fixes), $1500+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Lincoln MKZ has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The engine (particularly water pump failures on the V6) and transmission can have expensive repair costs. Electrical issues like the MyLincoln Touch system (if equipped) can be frustrating. The severity of these issues varies, but budgeting for potential repairs is advisable when considering purchasing a used 2012 MKZ. While the vehicle offers a comfortable ride and some luxury features, these potential problems should be factored into the overall ownership experience.
