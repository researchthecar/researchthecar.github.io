The 2019 Lincoln MKZ is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a stylish design. The base engine is a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. There is also a 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6 engine option producing 350 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque (FWD) or 400 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque (AWD). A hybrid powertrain is also available, combining a 2.0L four-cylinder engine with an electric motor. The 2.0L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission while the 3.0L is paired with an 6-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid is paired with a CVT. Owners generally appreciate the MKZ's quiet cabin, comfortable seats, and user-friendly technology, but some criticize its somewhat uninspired handling and occasionally problematic infotainment system.
