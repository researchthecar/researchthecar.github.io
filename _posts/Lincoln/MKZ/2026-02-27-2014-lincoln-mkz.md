### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Lincoln MKZ presents a mixed reliability profile. While the hybrid powertrain is generally robust, the turbocharged gasoline engine can experience coolant leaks and turbocharger issues. The automatic transmission may develop problems with harsh shifting or leaks. Electrically, the MyLincoln Touch infotainment system is a known source of frustration with freezing screens, and battery drain can occur. Suspension components, particularly on models with adaptive suspension, may require sensor replacements. Overall, the MKZ offers a comfortable and stylish luxury experience, but potential buyers should be prepared for the possibility of addressing some of these common issues, especially concerning the powertrain and electronics.
