### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Lincoln MKZ presents a mixed reliability profile. While the powertrain is generally robust, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as coolant leaks and timing chain concerns with the 3.5L V6 engine. Transmission problems, particularly harsh shifting, can also arise. Suspension components like control arm bushings are prone to wear, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, including power window motors and instrument cluster failures, are also noted. Exterior components are typically reliable, but interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure can impact comfort. Overall, the MKZ offers a comfortable ride, but diligent maintenance and awareness of these specific potential problems are crucial for long-term ownership.
