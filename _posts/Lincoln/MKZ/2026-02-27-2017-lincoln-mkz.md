### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Lincoln MKZ presents a generally reliable option within the luxury sedan segment, particularly with its hybrid powertrain. While the gasoline engines and automatic transmission have seen some reports of issues like coolant leaks, turbocharger problems, and transmission shuddering, these are not universally experienced and often fall within the expected range for vehicles of this age and mileage. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are more common concerns that owners should be aware of. The suspension, exterior, and interior components have shown good durability. Overall, routine maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging issues will contribute to a positive ownership experience.
