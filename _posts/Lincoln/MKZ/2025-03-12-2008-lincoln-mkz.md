The 2008 Lincoln MKZ is a mid-size luxury sedan that was available with two engine options: a 3.5L Duratec V6 producing 263 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L inline 4-cylinder engine with an electric motor that produced 191 horsepower. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the MKZ's comfortable ride, quiet interior, and stylish design.
