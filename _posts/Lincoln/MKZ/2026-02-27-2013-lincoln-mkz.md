### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Lincoln MKZ presents a generally reliable profile, with most major systems performing as expected. The powertrain options, particularly the 3.7L V6, are robust. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the 2.0L EcoBoost turbocharger and coolant leaks, as well as hybrid battery degradation in the hybrid model. The 6-speed automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit shifting problems. Electrically, the SYNC infotainment system is a common source of glitches, and battery drain can occur. Interior and exterior components are largely free of widespread complaints. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are recommended to ensure long-term reliability.
