Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints related to the 2003 Lincoln Blackwood, broken down by category and system.

The 2003 Lincoln Blackwood was Lincoln's first attempt at a pickup truck, blending luxury features with truck functionality. It was only offered for the 2002 model year (production started in 2001) and 2003 model year. The Blackwood features a distinctive, fully carpeted bed with a power tonneau cover. The sole engine option was the 5.4L InTech V8, producing 300 horsepower and 355 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Blackwood's comfortable ride and luxurious interior but find its limited bed space, low payload capacity, and unique features (like the power tonneau cover) prone to issues. Its styling, though distinctive, also proved polarizing, contributing to its short production run.

**Engine**

**5.4L InTech V8**

* **Spark Plug Blowout**
    * Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to weak threads. This results in a loud popping noise, misfire, and significant loss of power. This is especially common on early 5.4L 2V engines.
    * Solution: Repair the cylinder head threads (e.g., with a Time-Sert kit) or replace the cylinder head. Installing new spark plugs with proper torque is essential after the repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the repair method and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold can crack, leading to vacuum leaks. Symptoms include rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold with an updated version.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic idling, stalling, or failure to maintain idle speed.
    * Solution: Replace the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission hesitates or shifts abruptly between gears.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush and filter), $500 - $1500+ (valve body/rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. This can be indicative of torque converter clutch failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, sometimes requiring a transmission rebuild depending on the extent of the damage.
