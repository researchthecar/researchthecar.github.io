The 2022 Lincoln Corsair is a compact luxury SUV that appeals to buyers seeking a comfortable and refined driving experience. Engine options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 250 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L plug-in hybrid engine producing 266 combined system horsepower, and an optional 2.3L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 295 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission except the plug-in hybrid which is paired with a CVT. Owners often praise the Corsair for its luxurious interior, quiet cabin, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include the infotainment system's complexity, potential reliability issues, and somewhat uninspired driving dynamics compared to sportier rivals.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**
*   **Engine Misfires/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing engine misfires, hesitation during acceleration, and rough idling, especially at lower mileages. These issues can sometimes be intermittent, making diagnosis challenging.
    *   Solution: The misfires could be caused by faulty spark plugs, coil packs, or fuel injectors. Diagnostics would be needed to identify the cause of the misfire. Replacement of these parts can solve the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the component that needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the 2.0L engine in their 2022 Lincoln Corsair consumes an unusual amount of oil between oil changes. The owners have indicated that they have to add quarts of oil in between scheduled oil changes to maintain proper engine function.
    *   Solution: The engine will have to be inspected to determine the cause of the oil consumption. This may be caused by worn piston rings, or leaking valve seals. The solution to this problem depends on the cause of the issue.

Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also be expensive to address. Overall, while not all Corsairs will experience these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase and possibly consider an extended warranty for added peace of mind.
