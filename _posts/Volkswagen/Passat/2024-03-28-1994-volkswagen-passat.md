* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt can fail prematurely, resulting in catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a loud squealing noise from the engine, engine misfires, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the timing belt according to the manufacturer's recommended intervals. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+
* **Coolant Temperature Sensor Failure:** The coolant temperature sensor can fail and provide incorrect readings to the engine computer, which can lead to engine overheating or running too cold. Symptoms include inaccurate temperature gauge readings, engine overheating, and poor fuel economy. The solution is to replace the coolant temperature sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+

**2.8L V6**

* **Head Gasket Failure:** The head gaskets can fail and leak coolant or oil, leading to overheating, oil leaks, and engine damage. Symptoms include a coolant leak, oil leak, white smoke from the exhaust, and engine overheating. The solution is to replace the head gaskets. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Intake Manifold Runner Control Failure:** The intake manifold runner control system can fail and cause poor engine performance and fuel economy. Symptoms include hesitation during acceleration and reduced engine power. The solution is to replace the intake manifold runner control system. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Shifter Cable Breakage:** The shifter cable can break, preventing the transmission from being shifted. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears and a loose or floppy gear shifter. The solution is to replace the shifter cable. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Solenoid Failure:** The transmission solenoid can fail and cause shifting problems, such as slipping gears, delayed shifts, and harsh shifts. Symptoms include rough or erratic shifting, difficulty engaging gears, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the failed solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+
* **Torque Converter Lock-Up Failure:** The torque converter clutch can fail to lock up, which can lead to reduced fuel economy and engine performance. Symptoms include a lack of acceleration power, engine surging, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the torque converter clutch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+
