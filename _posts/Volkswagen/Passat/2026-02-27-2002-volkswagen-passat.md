The most significant concerns lie within the electrical system, particularly window regulators and instrument clusters, and specific engine components like ignition coils and coolant flanges on the VR6. Automatic transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, are also noted. While the manual transmission and suspension are generally more robust, control arm bushings can wear. Owners should be prepared for potential repair costs related to these known weaknesses. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and timely repairs, the Passat can remain a reliable vehicle.
