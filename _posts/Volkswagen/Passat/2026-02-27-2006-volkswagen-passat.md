### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Volkswagen Passat presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.0L FSI engine is prone to timing chain and PCV issues, while the 2.0L TDI diesel can suffer from DPF and EGR problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the DSG, can be costly to repair due to mechatronic unit or clutch issues. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and CAN bus communication errors, are also noted. However, the VR6 engine and manual transmissions generally fare better. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out. While the exterior is typically robust, interior electronics like the infotainment system can be temperamental. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating potential repair costs.
