### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volkswagen Passat presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline engines, particularly the 2.0L FSI, are prone to timing chain and PCV issues, while the 3.6L VR6 can suffer from intake manifold problems. Diesel variants may encounter DPF issues. Automatic transmissions, especially the 09G, have documented torque converter and valve body concerns. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear out. Electrically, window regulators and HVAC resistors are common failure points, and CAN bus communication errors can be complex and costly to diagnose. Manual transmissions and exterior/interior components generally fare better. Proactive maintenance and awareness of these common issues are key to managing ownership costs for this model.
