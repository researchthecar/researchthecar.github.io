### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Volkswagen Passat presents a mixed reliability profile. The 1.8T engine requires diligent maintenance, particularly regarding the timing belt and PCV system, while the VR6 has its own set of coolant and oil leak vulnerabilities, with timing chain issues being a significant concern. Automatic transmissions can be prone to torque converter and valve body problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings are common wear items. Electrically, window regulators and climate control modules are known to fail. Interior issues like pixelated displays are also frequently reported. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the Passat to be a comfortable and capable vehicle when properly maintained, with repair costs varying significantly based on the specific problem and labor rates.
