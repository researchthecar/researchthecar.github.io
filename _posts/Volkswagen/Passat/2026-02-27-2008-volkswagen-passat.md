### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Volkswagen Passat presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline engines, particularly the 2.0L Turbo FSI, are prone to timing chain and PCV system issues, while the 3.6L VR6 can suffer from intake manifold problems. Diesel variants, the 2.0L TDI, commonly face DPF and EGR valve issues. Automatic transmissions, specifically the 6-speed 09G, have documented problems with the torque converter and valve body. Manual transmissions appear more robust. Electrical issues like window regulators and HVAC resistors are also noted. Suspension, exterior, and interior components generally fare better with fewer widespread reported problems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating potential repair costs.
