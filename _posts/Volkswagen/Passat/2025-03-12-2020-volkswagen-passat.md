The 2020 Volkswagen Passat received a refresh for its final model year in the US market, offering a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. It came standard with a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 174 horsepower and 206 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked its spacious cabin and smooth ride, but some found the engine performance to be adequate rather than exciting and wished for more modern styling. A common complaint was the aging design compared to its competitors.
