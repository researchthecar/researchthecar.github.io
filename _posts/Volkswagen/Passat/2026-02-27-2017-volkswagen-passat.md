### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volkswagen Passat demonstrates reasonable reliability, particularly with its naturally aspirated 3.6L VR6 engine and standard chassis components, which show no widespread reported issues. However, owners of models equipped with the turbocharged 1.8L TSI engine should be aware of potential coolant leaks and oil consumption concerns. The diesel 2.0L TDI variant may encounter issues related to the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and EGR valve. Transmission reliability varies; the 6-speed automatic can experience shifting problems, while the DSG transmission is susceptible to mechatronic unit failures. Electrical issues, such as infotainment glitches and power window malfunctions, are also noted. Overall, the Passat is a competent vehicle, but potential buyers should consider the specific engine and transmission combination and factor in potential repair costs for known issues.
