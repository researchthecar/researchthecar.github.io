The 2000 Volkswagen Passat was a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available features. Engine options included a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L V6 producing 190 horsepower and 206 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual (available with both engines) and a 5-speed automatic. Common likes included the car's refined driving experience and solid build quality. Dislikes often centered around reliability concerns and higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors.
