**Engine**

**1.8L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1.8T engine is prone to sludge buildup, particularly if oil changes are not performed regularly using the correct synthetic oil. This can lead to oil starvation, causing significant engine damage, including turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a flashing oil light, unusual engine noises, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes every 3,000-5,000 miles with high-quality synthetic oil, use of an oil flush during oil changes, and possibly engine cleaning if sludge is suspected. In severe cases, engine replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ignition coil packs are known to fail, leading to misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per coil pack (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
