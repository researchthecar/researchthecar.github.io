**Summary**

The 2014 Volkswagen Passat can be a comfortable and practical car, but it's important to be aware of the potential issues. The TDI engine, while fuel-efficient, can be expensive to repair due to potential HPFP, DPF, and EGR cooler failures. The 1.8T engine can suffer from timing chain tensioner and oil leak problems. The DSG transmission requires regular maintenance and is prone to mechatronic unit and clutch wear issues. Electrical and interior issues, while less severe, can still be annoying and costly to repair. Overall, prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed and budget for potential repairs.
