The 2004 Volkswagen Passat is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available all-wheel drive (4Motion). Engine options included a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4, a 2.0L TDI inline-4 (Diesel), and a 2.8L V6. The 1.8L turbo produced around 170 hp and 166 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic, and a 6-speed manual (depending on the engine). Owners often appreciate the Passat's refined driving experience and upscale feel, but common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and the engine.
