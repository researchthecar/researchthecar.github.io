### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Volkswagen Passat presents a mixed reliability picture. Its 1.8T engine is prone to PCV and ignition coil issues, while the VR6 and W8 engines carry the significant risk of expensive timing chain repairs. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 5-speed 01M, can develop torque converter and valve body problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items. Electrically, window regulators and HVAC resistors are frequent culprits. Interior issues often involve pixelated displays and HVAC control panels. While offering a comfortable and refined experience, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the more complex engines and transmissions.
