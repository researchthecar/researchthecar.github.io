The 2007 Volkswagen Passat is a mid-size sedan that offered a blend of comfort, style, and performance. Engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing around 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L VR6 engine making approximately 280 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0T engine was typically paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the VR6 was exclusively available with the 6-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Passat for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and German engineering, but common complaints included electrical issues, oil leaks, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (BPY)**
*   **Cam Follower Failure (High-Pressure Fuel Pump)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, rough idle, loss of power, check engine light. This occurs due to wear on the cam follower that actuates the high-pressure fuel pump, eventually leading to the follower punching through and damaging the pump and camshaft.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam follower, and potentially the high-pressure fuel pump and camshaft if damaged. Upgrading to a revised cam follower design is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ (depending on the extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost, decreased acceleration, fluttering sound from the engine bay. The diverter valve recirculates excess boost pressure, and a tear in the diaphragm causes it to leak.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the diverter valve, often upgraded to a stronger aftermarket unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud rattling noise during cold starts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt and tensioner, the recommended interval for this is every 80,000 miles.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L VR6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. This is caused by wear on the timing chains, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chains, guides, and tensioners. This is a complex and expensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover, Rear Main Seal)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the car, burning oil smell.
