**Introduction**

The 2005 Volkswagen Passat is a popular midsize sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and decent handling. It's powered by a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 2.8-liter V6 that produces 190 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, mated to a five-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-liter V6 that produces 280 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission; and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT).
