### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volkswagen Passat presents a mixed reliability picture. While its European engineering offers a refined driving experience, certain engine options, particularly the VR6 and W8, are prone to significant and costly repairs like timing chain issues and coolant leaks. The automatic transmissions, especially the 01M, can also be a source of expensive problems. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and dashboard display issues, are common. However, the 1.8T engine, while having its own set of potential failures like ignition coils and PCV systems, is generally considered more manageable. The diesel engine has specific concerns related to the DPF. Owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs, especially with the more complex engines and transmissions. Regular and diligent maintenance is crucial to mitigate some of these common issues.
