### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Volkswagen Passat offers a generally reliable ownership experience, especially with the V6 engine. The 2.5L and 2.0T engines have some documented issues, primarily related to oil leaks, ignition coils, and water pumps, which are not uncommon for turbocharged or older naturally aspirated designs. Automatic transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, can occur and may require significant repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and power windows, are also noted. Overall, the Passat is a practical vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific powertrain and electrical concerns and factor in potential maintenance costs.
