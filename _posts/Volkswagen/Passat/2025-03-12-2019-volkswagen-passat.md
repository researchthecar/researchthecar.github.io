The 2019 Volkswagen Passat is a mid-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 174 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. What people often appreciate about the Passat is its generous rear legroom, smooth highway cruising, and simple infotainment system. Common criticisms include a somewhat uninspired driving experience compared to some rivals and a design that, while handsome, lacks a cutting-edge feel.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently and address any leaks. In severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and required repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling noises from the engine bay, and potentially the check engine light illuminating.

**Summary**

The 2019 Volkswagen Passat generally presents relatively minor issues, with the most prevalent complaints revolving around the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. The most commonly reported engine issue is excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to remedy if it progresses to piston ring or engine damage. Transmission issues manifest as rough shifting, potentially requiring a fluid flush or more significant repairs. Electrical glitches primarily involve infotainment system freezes and battery drain. Although these issues can be frustrating, most are not catastrophic if addressed promptly. The severity of the issues ranges from moderate to potentially severe (engine damage from oil consumption), and the cost to fix can vary from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and its extent.
