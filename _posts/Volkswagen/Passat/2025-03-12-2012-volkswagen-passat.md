The 2012 Volkswagen Passat marked a shift for the model, focusing on value and practicality for the North American market. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-5 cylinder producing 170 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L TDI Clean Diesel inline-4 cylinder making 140 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L VR6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options varied depending on the engine, with a 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic for the 2.5L, a 6-speed manual and 6-speed DSG (dual-clutch) for the TDI, and a 6-speed DSG for the VR6. Owners often praised the Passat's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency (particularly the TDI). Common criticisms included the somewhat bland styling and perceived cost-cutting measures compared to previous generations.
