The 2017 Volkswagen Passat is a mid-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and large trunk. Engine options include a 1.8L TSI turbocharged inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L VR6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 1.8L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the VR6 engine is paired with a 6-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Passat for its fuel efficiency (especially with the 1.8T), roomy rear seats, and smooth handling. Common complaints include the somewhat bland styling, some cheaper interior materials, and the availability of advanced features limited to higher trim levels.

**Summary:**

The 2017 Volkswagen Passat, while generally reliable, does have some potential issues to be aware of. The 1.8T engine can suffer from turbocharger failure and excessive oil consumption, which can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, particularly rough shifting in the 6-speed automatic paired with the 1.8T, are also a concern. Other potential issues include suspension noises from failing strut mounts and control arm bushings, electrical problems like battery drain and infotainment system malfunctions, and sunroof leaks. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but some can be quite expensive to fix. It is recommended to get a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic and obtain a vehicle history report to identify potential problems before buying a used 2017 Passat.
