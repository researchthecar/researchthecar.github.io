The 2022 Volkswagen Passat marked the end of its run in the US market, a mid-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. The sole engine option was a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 174 horsepower and 206 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciated the Passat's roomy cabin and smooth ride, some common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system and some transmission quirks.

**Engine**

**2.0L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) 4-Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure warning light illuminating and needing to add oil more often than usual.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update may help. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection to determine the cause (e.g., piston rings, valve seals) may be necessary, potentially leading to engine repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Dependent on the severity and cause; diagnostics alone can range from $100 - $300. Engine repair or replacement could be several thousand dollars.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing turbocharger failure, resulting in a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or hissing), and potentially an engine warning light.
    * Solution: Turbocharger replacement is usually required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted harsh or jerky shifting, especially during low-speed acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: Initially, a transmission control module (TCM) reset or software update may improve the shifting behavior. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission may be needed, potentially leading to valve body repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: TCM reset/software update: $100-$200. Valve body repair/replacement: $800 - $1500+. Transmission Replacement: $3,000-$5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    * Solution: A software update from the dealership is often the first step. In more severe cases, the entire infotainment unit might need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $0 (if under warranty) - $150. Infotainment unit replacement: $500 - $1500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., TPMS, Parking Sensors)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erroneous readings or complete failure of various sensors, such as the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) or parking sensors. This can trigger warning lights on the dashboard and affect the functionality of driver-assistance features.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400 per sensor, depending on the type and location.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery drains prematurely, leading to starting issues or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by parasitic drain from faulty modules or accessories.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the drain, followed by repair or replacement of the faulty component. Replacing the battery may also be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnostic fee: $100-$200. Battery replacement: $150-$300. Repairing the parasitic drain source: Varies widely depending on the issue, can range from $100 to $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, fail to open or close properly, or leak water into the cabin.
    * Solution: Inspection of the sunroof mechanism, including tracks, seals, and motor. Repair or replacement of faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2022 Volkswagen Passat, while appreciated for its comfort and space, experienced some common issues. Engine problems such as excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failure can be costly. Transmission issues like rough shifting can degrade the driving experience. Electrical problems, particularly infotainment system glitches and sensor malfunctions, also emerged as recurring complaints. The severity and cost of these issues varied, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas. While no recalls were found for these specific issues, it is always important to check the NHTSA website for any open recalls.
