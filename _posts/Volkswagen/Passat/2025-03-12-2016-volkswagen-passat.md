The 2016 Volkswagen Passat is a mid-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. Engine options include a 1.8L turbocharged four-cylinder (170 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.6L VR6 (280 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque). Most models are equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission; the VR6 is paired with a DSG automatic. People often praise the Passat for its large backseat, quiet cabin, and smooth highway driving. Common complaints include a somewhat bland interior design and less engaging driving dynamics compared to some rivals.

The 1.8T engine can experience oil leaks and turbocharger problems, while the VR6 engine is susceptible to timing chain tensioner failure. Both transmissions have their share of problems. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and door lock actuators are also common. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but some repairs, such as turbocharger or Mechatronic unit replacements, can be quite expensive. While the Passat offers comfort and space, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems.
