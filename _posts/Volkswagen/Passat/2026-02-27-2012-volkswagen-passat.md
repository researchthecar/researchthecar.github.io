### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Volkswagen Passat offers a generally reliable ownership experience, especially with the naturally aspirated engines and manual transmissions. The 2.5L and 2.0 TSI engines have some documented issues, primarily related to ignition coils, oil leaks, and timing components, which are not uncommon for turbocharged or older engine designs. The DSG transmission, while offering performance benefits, has a higher potential for costly mechatronic unit failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and power windows, can occur but are often manageable. Overall, with proper maintenance and awareness of potential issues, the 2012 Passat can be a dependable vehicle.
