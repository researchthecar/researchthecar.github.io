## Engine

### 2.0L Turbocharged FSI (Gasoline)
**Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Engine misfires, rough idle, rattling noise from the front of the engine, check engine light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of timing chain, tensioners, guides, and seals. Regular oil changes are crucial to prevent premature wear.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500

**PCV System Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Engine oil leaks, rough idle, whistling noise, increased oil consumption.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve and associated hoses.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


### 3.6L VR6 (Gasoline)
**Intake Manifold Runner Flap Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Check engine light, rough idle, poor engine performance, reduced fuel economy.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold assembly or repair of the runner flap mechanism.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


### 2.0L TDI (Diesel)
**Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, check engine light, potential for engine stalling.
- **Solution:** Forced regeneration of the DPF, or replacement if severely clogged. Regular highway driving can help prevent buildup.
- **Cost:** $700 - $1500

**EGR Valve Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Rough idle, black smoke from exhaust, check engine light, poor performance.
- **Solution:** Cleaning or replacement of the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700


## Transmission

### 6-Speed Automatic (09G/09K)
**Torque Converter Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering during acceleration, slipping gears, delayed engagement, transmission warning light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the torque converter and potentially a transmission fluid flush.
- **Cost:** $1000 - $2000

**Valve Body Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh shifting, delayed shifts, transmission slipping, error codes related to solenoids.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of the transmission valve body.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500


### 6-Speed Manual
**No Major Issues**

### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Volkswagen Passat presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline engines, particularly the 2.0L FSI, are prone to timing chain and PCV system issues, while the 3.6L VR6 can experience intake manifold problems. Diesel variants, the 2.0L TDI, commonly face DPF and EGR valve issues, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions, especially the 6-speed variants, have documented problems with torque converters and valve bodies. Manual transmissions are generally more robust. Electrical components like window regulators and HVAC resistors can also fail. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally reliable, with no widespread critical issues reported. Prospective buyers should be aware of potential powertrain and transmission costs, especially with higher mileage vehicles.
