**Engine**

**1.8L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 1.8T engine is prone to oil sludge buildup due to a small oil capacity and inadequate crankcase ventilation. Symptoms include oil pressure warning lights, engine knocking, and eventual engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and a larger oil filter (if available) are crucial. If sludge is already present, an engine flush or manual cleaning of the oil pan and pickup tube may be necessary. In severe cases, engine replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change) - $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coil packs can fail, leading to misfires, rough running, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s). It's often recommended to replace all coil packs at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per coil pack + labor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vacuum leaks are common due to brittle plastic hoses and fittings. Symptoms include rough idling, poor fuel economy, and check engine lights (typically P0171 or P0172 codes).
