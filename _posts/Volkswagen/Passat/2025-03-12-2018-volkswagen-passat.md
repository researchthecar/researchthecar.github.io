The 2018 Volkswagen Passat is a mid-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and composed handling. The base engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 174 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Some drivers appreciate the Passat's understated styling and large trunk, while others find the interior design somewhat dated and the driving experience less engaging than some competitors. A common complaint is the infotainment system's responsiveness and lack of some modern features.
