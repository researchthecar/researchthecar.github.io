### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volkswagen Passat offers a generally reliable ownership experience, with the 2.5L gasoline engine and 6-speed automatic transmission being the most common and typically robust configurations. While issues like ignition coil failures and oil leaks can occur with the 2.5L, they are usually repairable at moderate costs. The turbocharged TSI engine, while offering better performance, may present more complex issues such as timing chain wear. Diesel TDI models can face DPF and EGR problems, common to many diesel vehicles. Transmission reliability is generally good, though the DSG can be more costly to repair if issues arise. Suspension components like control arm bushings are typical wear items. Electrical issues are infrequent but can involve window regulators or infotainment glitches. Overall, the Passat is a dependable choice, especially when properly maintained, with most potential problems being addressable without excessive expense.
