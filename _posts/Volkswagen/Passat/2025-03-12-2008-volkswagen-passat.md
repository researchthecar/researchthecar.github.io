Owners often praise the Passat's European driving dynamics and premium features, but common complaints revolve around reliability issues and higher maintenance costs compared to some of its competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (BPY)**

*   **Cam Follower Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, rough idle, loss of power, and eventually, complete fuel pump failure. This happens when the cam follower wears through, damaging the camshaft lobe.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam follower regularly, or convert to a roller bearing follower. If damage to the camshaft has occurred, the camshaft must also be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on camshaft damage and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diverter Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost, decreased fuel economy, and possible check engine light. The diverter valve recirculates excess boost pressure back into the intake system.
    *   Solution: Replace the diverter valve with an updated version (revision D is a common upgrade) or aftermarket performance diverter valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil drips under the car, burning oil smell, low oil level. Common leak points include the valve cover gasket, rear main seal, and timing chain tensioner.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L VR6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise on startup, especially when cold. In severe cases, the engine may run poorly or not start at all. This issue is typically caused by worn timing chain guides and tensioners.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chains, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced engine performance, and poor fuel economy. The IMRC system controls airflow into the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty IMRC unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Aisin)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, and possible limp mode. The valve body controls the flow of transmission fluid to the various components.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. In some cases, a software update may help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and tire wear may also be noticeable.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door not locking or unlocking properly, requiring manual operation.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Comfort Control Module Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, or interior lights.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the comfort control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Drain Clogs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, often into the footwells. Clogged sunroof drains prevent water from properly draining away.
    *   Solution: Clean the sunroof drains to remove debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (mostly labor for diagnosing and cleaning)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Glove Box Latch Failure**
