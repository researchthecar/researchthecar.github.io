**Introduction:**

The 2012 Volkswagen Passat is a midsize sedan that was offered with 2.5L 5-cylinder, 3.6L V6, and 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine options. The 2.5L engine came with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L engine came with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0L turbocharged engine was paired with a 6-speed dual-clutch automated manual transmission (DSG). The Passat received praise for its spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and responsive handling.
