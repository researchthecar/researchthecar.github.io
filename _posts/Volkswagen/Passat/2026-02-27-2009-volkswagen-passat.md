### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volkswagen Passat presents a mixed reliability profile. While the chassis and general build quality are often praised, specific powertrain components, particularly the gasoline 3.6L VR6 engine's timing chain and the automatic transmission's torque converter, can be sources of significant expense. Diesel models may encounter issues with emissions systems like the DPF and EGR. Electrical components like window regulators and HVAC resistors are also noted. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of these common issues can help mitigate potential repair costs and ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
