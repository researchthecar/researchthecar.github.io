### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volkswagen Passat is generally considered a reliable vehicle, especially with the 1.8L TSI and 3.6L VR6 engines. The 2.0L TDI diesel engine, while efficient, has had some documented issues related to its emissions system (DPF and EGR), which can be costly to repair if they fail. Transmission reliability is mixed; the standard automatic is generally robust, but the DSG dual-clutch transmission has a higher incidence of issues, particularly with the mechatronic unit and clutch packs. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and power window failures, are not uncommon but are typically manageable. Overall, for a mid-size sedan, the Passat offers a good balance of comfort, space, and performance, with most potential issues being addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
