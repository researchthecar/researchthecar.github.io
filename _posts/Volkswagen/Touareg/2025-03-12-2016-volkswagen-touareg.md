The 2016 Volkswagen Touareg is a mid-size SUV that offers a blend of luxury and capability. The most common engine option is a 3.6L VR6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, but a 3.0L TDI V6 diesel engine rated at 240 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque was also available. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Touareg's comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and off-road capabilities. Common complaints revolve around higher maintenance costs compared to other SUVs and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2016 Volkswagen Touareg, particularly with the TDI engine, can experience some relatively expensive issues, primarily relating to the fuel and emissions systems. The VR6 also has some common coolant leak issues. Electrical problems such as battery drains and infotainment malfunctions also occur, though usually at a lower cost to repair. Air suspension issues, if equipped, can also be expensive. While the Touareg offers a comfortable and capable driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs.
