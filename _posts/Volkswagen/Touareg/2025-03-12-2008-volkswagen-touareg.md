The 2008 Volkswagen Touareg is a mid-size luxury SUV that offers a blend of off-road capability and on-road comfort. Engine options included a 3.6L VR6 producing 280 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, a 4.2L V8 with 350 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 TDI diesel engine outputting 225 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed automatic transmission was standard across all engine options. Owners generally appreciate the Touareg's luxurious interior, strong towing capacity, and capable all-wheel-drive system. Common complaints include higher-than-average maintenance costs, electrical issues, and relatively poor fuel economy.
