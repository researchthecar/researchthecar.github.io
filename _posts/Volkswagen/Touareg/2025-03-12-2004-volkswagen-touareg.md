The 2004 Volkswagen Touareg was the first generation of Volkswagen's mid-size luxury SUV. It came with a range of engine options, including a 3.2L VR6 (220 hp, 225 lb-ft torque), a 4.2L V8 (310 hp, 302 lb-ft torque), and a 5.0L V10 TDI diesel (310 hp, 553 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Touareg for its off-road capabilities, luxurious interior, and powerful engine options.
