### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volkswagen Touareg demonstrates good overall reliability, especially with its standard powertrain and suspension. The most commonly cited issues tend to be related to the more complex systems, such as the adaptive air suspension and the diesel engine's emissions control components (DPF, EGR). For gasoline models, timing chain wear and oil leaks are potential concerns that can arise with higher mileage. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and power tailgate, are also noted but generally not critical. Owners who maintain their vehicles diligently and address potential issues promptly can expect a dependable luxury SUV experience.
