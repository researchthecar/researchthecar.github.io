The 2020 Volkswagen Gol is a subcompact hatchback primarily sold in South America. It is known for its affordability and practicality. Engine options typically include a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine, a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, and sometimes a 1.0-liter three-cylinder TSI turbocharged engine. The 1.0-liter MPI engine generally produces around 75 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque. While praised for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, owners often cite its basic features and relatively modest performance as drawbacks.
