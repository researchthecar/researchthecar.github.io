The 2018 Volkswagen Gol is a subcompact car popular in South America and other markets. It is not officially sold in North America. A primary engine option for the 2018 model is the 1.0-liter three-cylinder MPI engine, producing around 75 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. Transmission choices typically included a 5-speed manual and an automated manual transmission (I-Motion). Owners generally appreciate the Gol for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability in urban environments. Downsides often cited include a basic interior, limited features, and relatively low power output, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**1.0L Three-Cylinder MPI**

*   **Excessive Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported excessive engine vibration, particularly at idle or low speeds. This can be felt through the steering wheel, seats, and floor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking engine mounts, spark plugs, and performing a compression test to identify any cylinder imbalances. Replacing worn or damaged engine mounts and spark plugs may resolve the issue. In some cases, fuel injectors can cause a rough idle, so it is a good idea to check for proper fuel injection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L Four-Cylinder**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets, such as the valve cover gasket or the crankshaft seal. This can result in visible oil spots under the vehicle and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking seals and gaskets is the common solution. Ensure proper torque specifications are followed during reassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging certain gears, particularly first and reverse. This can be accompanied by grinding noises during shifting.
    *   Solution: Inspect the clutch cable (if applicable) or hydraulic clutch system for proper adjustment and leaks. Worn synchros in the transmission may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**I-Motion Automated Manual Transmission**

*   **Jerky Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and jerky gear changes, especially during low-speed driving. Hesitation or delays when shifting.
    *   Solution: Software updates may improve shifting behavior. Inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. In some cases, issues with the transmission control module (TCM) can cause shifting problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension when driving over bumps. Excessive body roll during cornering. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components such as shocks, struts, control arm bushings, and ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
