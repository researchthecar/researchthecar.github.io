The 2011 Volkswagen Gol is a subcompact car primarily sold in South America. Engine options for this model year typically include a 1.0L inline-4 gasoline engine (around 72-76 horsepower depending on fuel type), a 1.6L inline-4 gasoline engine (around 101-104 horsepower), and sometimes flex-fuel variants that can run on gasoline or ethanol. The 1.0L engine offers acceptable performance for city driving but can feel underpowered on the highway. The 1.6L engine provides a more noticeable increase in power. The Gol is generally liked for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and nimble handling. Dislikes often include its basic interior, limited features, and in some markets, concerns about safety ratings compared to newer vehicles.
