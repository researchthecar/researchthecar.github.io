The 2013 Volkswagen CrossFox is a subcompact crossover produced primarily for the South American market. It typically features a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine. Power output is around 104 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, depending on the fuel used (gasoline or ethanol, common in Brazil). Transmission options usually include a 5-speed manual and an automated manual (I-Motion). Owners generally appreciate the CrossFox for its slightly raised suspension, giving it better ground clearance than a standard hatchback, and its unique styling. Common complaints often revolve around the relatively low power output of the engine, interior plastic quality, and ride comfort on rough roads.
