The 2017 Volkswagen CrossFox is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its rugged styling and slightly elevated ride height, offering a blend of city maneuverability and mild off-road capability. The 2017 CrossFox was only available with a 1.6L inline 4-cylinder engine producing 101 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission was the only transmission option. Owners often appreciate the CrossFox for its unique design and practicality, but some criticize its underpowered engine and dated interior.
