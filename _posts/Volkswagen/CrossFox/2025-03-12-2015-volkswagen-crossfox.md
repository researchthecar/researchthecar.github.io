The 2015 Volkswagen CrossFox is a subcompact crossover SUV primarily sold in South America. It features a rugged, off-road-inspired design and is known for its higher ground clearance compared to a standard hatchback. The 2015 CrossFox is typically equipped with a 1.6-liter inline-four gasoline engine that produces around 104 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is the most common option, though some models feature an automated manual transmission (I-Motion). Owners generally appreciate the CrossFox for its distinctive styling, practicality, and ability to handle rough roads. Common complaints often revolve around the somewhat underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded, and the ride quality can be firm.
