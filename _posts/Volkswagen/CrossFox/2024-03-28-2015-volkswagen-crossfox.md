**Introduction:**

The 2015 Volkswagen CrossFox is a compact crossover SUV that was only sold in Brazil. It is available with a 1.6L gasoline engine and a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission. The 1.6L engine produces 101 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. The CrossFox is known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. However, it has also been reported to have some issues.

**Engine**

**1.6L Gasoline Engine**

* **Oil Leaks:** Oil leaks can occur from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots on the ground or driveway and low oil levels on the dipstick. The leak can be fixed by replacing the faulty gasket or seal. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
* **Timing Chain Issues:** The timing chain may stretch or break over time, causing the engine to lose timing and run poorly. Symptoms include engine misfires, rough idle, and reduced power. The timing chain can be replaced to fix the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Shifting Problems:** Some owners have reported difficulty shifting gears, especially when the transmission is cold. The problem can be caused by worn or damaged shift linkages or a faulty clutch. Replacing the faulty parts can fix the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Slipping:** The transmission may slip or hesitate when shifting gears. This can be caused by worn or damaged clutches or a faulty torque converter. Rebuilding or replacing the transmission is the solution to the problem. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Issues:** Some owners have reported problems with the climate control system, such as malfunctioning AC or heating systems. The issue can be caused by faulty sensors or a faulty climate control unit. Repairing or replacing the faulty parts can fix the problem. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
* **Wind Noise:** Some CrossFox models may experience excessive wind noise from the doors or windows. The problem can be addressed by adjusting the door seals or replacing the window trim. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
