### Summary Verdict

Electrical systems, specifically the infotainment and potential battery drain, are areas where minor glitches or issues can occur, though often resolvable with software updates. Exterior and interior components are largely holding up well. Overall, the T-Cross is a reliable choice for its segment, with the primary caution being the potential for DSG transmission issues and occasional electrical quirks.
