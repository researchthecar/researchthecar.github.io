The 2022 Volkswagen T-Cross is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its stylish design, practicality, and fuel efficiency. Engine options for the 2022 model typically include a 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing around 110 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 150 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, depending on the market. These engines are typically paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praise the T-Cross for its nimble handling, comfortable ride, and spacious interior for its class. However, some criticisms include the relatively basic interior materials and, in some markets, limited engine choices.

**Engine**

**1.0L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between service intervals. This is often noticed through the low oil level warning light appearing on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Check engine for any leaks or improper seals. A software update may be available to help mitigate this issue. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is generally $100-$200. Piston ring replacement can range from $1,500 - $3,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the turbocharger, loss of power, and potentially an engine warning light are symptoms.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage. Replacement of the turbocharger is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L TSI Engine**

*   **Hesitation/Stuttering Upon Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hesitation or stuttering during acceleration, particularly at lower RPMs. This can feel like a momentary loss of power.
    *   Solution: Check the spark plugs for proper gap and wear. Inspect the fuel injectors for clogs. Also check the ignition coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Spark plug replacement: $100 - $300. Fuel injector cleaning or replacement: $200 - $600. Ignition coil replacement: $100-$400.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox) Automatic Transmission**

*   **Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds or when shifting between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may help. In some cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100 - $200. Clutch replacement: $1,500 - $3,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission not shifting properly, getting stuck in gear, or refusing to shift. The transmission warning light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the mechatronic unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,800 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Uneven tire wear may also be observed.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn suspension components such as control arm bushings, ball joints, or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Control arm bushing replacement: $200 - $500 per arm. Ball joint replacement: $150 - $400 per joint. Shock absorber replacement: $200 - $600 per shock.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes frequently. This may affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: Software update for the infotainment system. In severe cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $0 - $150 (if available). Infotainment unit replacement: $500 - $1,500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors not functioning correctly, giving false alarms, or not detecting obstacles.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per sensor.

    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and secure the loose trim panel or component. Felt tape or foam padding may be used to dampen the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the complexity and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Volkswagen T-Cross can experience issues ranging from minor inconveniences to more significant mechanical problems. The 1.0L TSI engines have been known to consume oil, and the 7-speed DSG transmission can exhibit jerky shifting or even mechatronic unit failures. Electrical issues, such as infotainment system glitches and sensor malfunctions, also occur. Suspension issues are less frequent but possible. The severity of these issues varies, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand for engine or transmission repairs. Owners should be vigilant about regular maintenance and address any unusual symptoms promptly to prevent more extensive damage.
