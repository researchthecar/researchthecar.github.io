**Introduction**
The 2007 Volkswagen Lupo is a subcompact city car known for its compact size, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability. It was available with a variety of engine and transmission options, including:

* 1.0L 3-cylinder gasoline engine with a 5-speed manual transmission (51 hp, 58 lb-ft)
* 1.2L 3-cylinder gasoline engine with a 5-speed manual transmission (60 hp, 74 lb-ft)

The Lupo was discontinued in 2007 due to poor sales in the United States. Despite its discontinuation, it remains a popular choice for budget-conscious drivers in Europe. Owners generally praise the Lupo's fuel efficiency, low maintenance costs, and fun-to-drive nature, while common complaints include its cramped interior and limited cargo space.
