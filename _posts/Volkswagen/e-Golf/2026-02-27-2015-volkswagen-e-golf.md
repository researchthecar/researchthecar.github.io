### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volkswagen e-Golf generally exhibits good reliability, particularly in its electric powertrain and mechanical components, which have fewer moving parts than traditional internal combustion engines. The primary areas of concern revolve around the electrical system, specifically potential battery degradation over time, which is a common characteristic of all EVs and often mitigated by manufacturer warranties. Issues with the charging system and infotainment software glitches have also been noted. However, for its intended use as a city car, the e-Golf is a dependable option, with most owners reporting satisfaction with its performance and build quality. Routine maintenance is minimal, but potential repairs to the battery or charging components can be costly outside of warranty.
