The 2020 Volkswagen Workline, primarily a commercial-oriented variant of the Transporter T6.1, offers a robust and practical solution for businesses. While engine options vary depending on the market, a common configuration is the 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine, typically producing around 110 horsepower and a suitable torque output for hauling cargo. Some owners appreciate its spacious cargo area, relatively comfortable ride (for a commercial vehicle), and straightforward functionality. Common dislikes include the basic interior trim, limited technology features, and potential for higher maintenance costs associated with diesel engines. Other available engine options include a higher horsepower version of the 2.0-liter TDI engine as well as a gasoline engine option. Transmission options include a manual and a DSG automatic.

**Summary**

The 2020 Volkswagen Workline, while a practical choice for commercial use, can be susceptible to a range of issues. The most common problems revolve around the diesel engine (EGR and DPF), the DSG transmission (Mechatronic unit and clutch packs), and electrical components. Suspension bushings and sliding door rollers are also known to wear prematurely. Repair costs can range from relatively minor fixes to more substantial expenses, particularly when dealing with transmission or engine-related problems.
