The 2018 Volkswagen Workline, primarily sold as a commercial van, offers practicality and utility. Engine options generally include a 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine. This engine produces around 100-150 horsepower and corresponding torque. Owners often appreciate its cargo capacity and fuel efficiency, while common complaints revolve around the relatively basic interior and ride quality.

**Engine**

**2.0L TDI Diesel**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and the engine management light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve. Cleaning *may* be a temporary fix, but replacement is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, especially with short trips and city driving. This leads to reduced engine performance, the DPF warning light illuminating, and potential limp mode activation.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF, replacement of the DPF, or DPF cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (for cleaning) to $1500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, unusual noises when pressing the clutch pedal.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement including pressure plate and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially when carrying heavy loads frequently. This leads to a lower ride height in the rear and reduced load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the parasitic draw, potentially including replacement of a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may fail to lock or unlock doors, or only work intermittently. This can be caused by a faulty door lock actuator or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the wiring, or replacement of the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult opening or closing the sliding door, sticking, or unusual noises. The latch mechanism or rollers may be worn or damaged.
    *   Solution: Lubrication, adjustment, or replacement of the sliding door latch, rollers, or associated components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Warning Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights illuminate on the dashboard, often without a clear explanation. This can be caused by a faulty sensor or module.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to determine the cause of the warning lights and repair/replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $200+ for diagnostic scan, plus the cost of repair/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Volkswagen Workline, while a practical work vehicle, exhibits several common issues. The engine and transmission, especially the TDI diesel and manual gearbox, can experience failures related to EGR valves, DPF clogging, and clutch wear. Suspension issues, particularly rear leaf spring sagging, are also reported. Electrical problems, like battery drains and central locking malfunctions, add to the potential maintenance concerns. Exterior issues such as sliding door malfunctions can also be annoying and costly to fix. Interior issues are usually limited to warning lights. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like DPF replacement, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchase.
