The 2021 Volkswagen Robust, known for its reliability and no-nonsense approach, offers a dependable option for those seeking a practical vehicle. Available engine options include a 1.6L inline-4 producing around 110 horsepower and 115 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0L inline-4 making approximately 150 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque.

    *   Solution: Initially, monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed is recommended. If consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test can help identify the source. Possible solutions include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
