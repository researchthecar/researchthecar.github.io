### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Volkswagen Robust demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly in its chassis and exterior components. However, potential owners should be aware of specific concerns within the powertrain, notably EGR cooler leaks and turbocharger issues with the 2.0L TDI engine, and DPF regeneration problems with the 3.0L V6 TDI. The 6-speed DSG transmission has also seen reports of mechatronics unit failures. Electrical systems, particularly the infotainment screen and intermittent battery drain, are other areas to monitor. While not indicative of universal failure, these documented issues represent the most common technical reliability concerns for this model year, suggesting proactive maintenance and awareness are key for long-term ownership satisfaction.
