The 2020 Volkswagen Robust is a compact pickup truck primarily sold in South America. It is known for its reliability, ruggedness, and affordability. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues and complaints. While not sold in the United States, it offers a utilitarian design and a focus on practicality. The Robust typically features a 1.6-liter inline-four gasoline engine producing around 101 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the truck's simple design, ease of maintenance, and robust build quality for work purposes. Common dislikes often revolve around its basic interior features and lack of modern amenities.
