The 2022 Volkswagen Arteon is a sleek, four-door "fastback" sedan that blends style and practicality. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 300 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic transmission. People often praise the Arteon for its distinctive design, spacious cabin, and comfortable ride. Downsides can include a higher price point compared to some competitors and a somewhat limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline.

**Engine**

**2.0L TSI Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may be noticed by a low oil pressure warning on the dash, or smoke coming from the tailpipes.
    *   Solution: Initially, owners may be advised to monitor oil levels and document consumption. In more severe cases, dealers may perform an oil consumption test. If consumption exceeds Volkswagen's acceptable threshold, potential fixes range from replacing PCV valve components to piston ring replacement or even engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $8,000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises from the engine (whining, screeching), check engine light. This can be due to a damaged impeller, or faulty wastegate actuator.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to confirm the failure. Replacement of the turbocharger unit. Inspection of oil lines for blockage to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed DSG Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Low-Speed Operation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation, jerky shifts, or rough engagement when accelerating from a stop or during low-speed maneuvers. This is most noticeable in stop-and-go traffic.
    *   Solution: Could be due to bad transmission fluid or solenoids. A transmission flush may solve the issue. Solenoids can be tested to see if they are not working properly. If that does not fix the issue, the transmission may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $7,000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may intermittently freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Check software version and update to the latest version. If the issue persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Faults (Parking Sensors, Lane Assist, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions of various driver-assistance systems due to sensor errors. This can include false alarms from parking sensors, lane departure warnings when not drifting, or adaptive cruise control disengaging unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using scan tool to identify faulty sensors. Replacement or recalibration of affected sensors. Check wiring harnesses for damage or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor/system.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may not open or close properly, get stuck, or leak water into the cabin.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or creaking noises emanating from various interior trim pieces, especially from the dashboard or door panels.
    *   Solution: Identification of the source of the noise. Tightening of loose fasteners or application of felt tape or other sound-deadening material to eliminate friction between trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on complexity and professional labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Power Seats**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power seats failing to move or adjust correctly.
    *   Solution: Could be a faulty motor, loose connection, or a fuse. Check the fuse first. Otherwise, replacing the motor or repairing the wires may solve the issue.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Volkswagen Arteon presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While the engine and transmission are generally reliable, some owners report oil consumption and DSG transmission quirks. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions also appear, although exterior and interior issues are not prevalent. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, with estimated costs varying widely depending on the specific problem and repair needed. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
