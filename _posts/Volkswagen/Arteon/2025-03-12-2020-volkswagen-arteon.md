The 2020 Volkswagen Arteon is a stylish and sporty four-door hatchback marketed as a premium vehicle. It features a single engine option in the US: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Arteon for its sleek design, spacious interior, and comfortable ride.
