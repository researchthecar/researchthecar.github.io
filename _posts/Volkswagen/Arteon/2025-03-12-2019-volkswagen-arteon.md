The 2019 Volkswagen Arteon is a sleek, four-door fastback offering a blend of style and practicality. It came standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its distinctive design, comfortable ride, and generous cargo space. However, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system, occasional electrical glitches, and the relatively high price point compared to competitors.

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling or whining noise from the engine bay, check engine light illuminated.
    * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, overheating, visible coolant pooling under the vehicle. Often traced to the water pump or coolant hoses.

    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Can also present as delayed engagement when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In others, a transmission fluid flush or, more seriously, valve body replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update) - $2,000+ (valve body)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, hesitation during acceleration.
    * Solution: This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or a faulty valve body. Requires diagnosis and repair, potentially including transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid) - $5,000+ (rebuild/replace)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or restarts unexpectedly. Can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    * Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic or inaccurate readings from parking sensors, blind spot monitoring system failing to detect vehicles, false alarms.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor, depending on location and complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (if performed by a mechanic)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Volkswagen Arteon presents some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. While the engine itself is generally reliable, turbocharger failures and coolant leaks can be costly. The 8-speed automatic transmission can experience rough shifting or slipping, potentially requiring expensive repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and sensors, can also be frustrating. Interior rattles and sunroof malfunctions can add to the overall ownership experience. Severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures. Estimated repair costs can be anywhere from a few hundred to several thousands of dollars, depending on the problem.
