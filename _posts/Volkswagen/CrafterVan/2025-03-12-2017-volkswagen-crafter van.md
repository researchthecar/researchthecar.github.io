**Summary**

The 2017 Volkswagen Crafter Van, while generally a practical and spacious vehicle, can suffer from a range of issues. Engine-related problems, particularly with the EGR valve and DPF on diesel models, are common. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic variants, can be costly to repair.
