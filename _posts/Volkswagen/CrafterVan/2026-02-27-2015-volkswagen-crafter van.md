### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volkswagen Crafter generally offers good reliability for commercial applications, but specific components can be prone to issues. The diesel engines, particularly the 2.0L TDI and 2.5L TDI, can experience DPF regeneration problems, turbocharger issues, and EGR valve malfunctions, which are common in many modern diesel vehicles. Transmission reliability is generally sound, though clutch wear in manuals and mechatronic unit issues in DSG automatics are noted. Suspension components like shock absorbers and leaf springs may require attention due to the vehicle's load-carrying nature. Electrical issues such as battery drain and alternator failure are also reported. Exterior and interior components are less prone to major failures, with door lock actuators and HVAC blower motors being the most common concerns. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and minimizing downtime of the Crafter.
