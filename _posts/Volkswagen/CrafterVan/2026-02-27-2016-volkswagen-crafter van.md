### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volkswagen Crafter generally exhibits good reliability, particularly in its core mechanical components when properly maintained. The most frequently reported issues tend to revolve around the diesel particulate filter (DPF) and EGR systems, common to many modern diesel engines, especially if driven primarily on short urban routes. Transmission issues, particularly with the DSG automatic, can be costly but are not universally reported. Suspension components and general electrical gremlins are also noted, but often fall within expected ranges for a commercial vehicle of this age and mileage. Overall, the Crafter is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be mindful of diesel emission system maintenance and potential electrical quirks.
