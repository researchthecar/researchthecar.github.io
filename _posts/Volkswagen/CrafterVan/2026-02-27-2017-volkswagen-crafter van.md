### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volkswagen Crafter generally offers good reliability for a commercial vehicle, with its robust build and functional design being key strengths. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) systems on higher-output engines and potential turbocharger or EGR valve problems. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can include clutch wear on manual gearboxes and fluid leaks on automatics. Electrical gremlins like battery drain can occur, and some owners have noted wear on suspension components and interior elements like the HVAC blower motor, especially under demanding usage. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maximizing the longevity and minimizing unexpected downtime of the Crafter.
