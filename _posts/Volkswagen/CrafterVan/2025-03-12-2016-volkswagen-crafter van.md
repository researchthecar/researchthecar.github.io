The 2016 Volkswagen Crafter is a popular choice for tradespeople and businesses needing a reliable and spacious van. The 2016 Crafter primarily used a 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine in various power outputs. These included outputs around 109 hp, 134 hp, and 161 hp with torque figures varying accordingly. Transmission options typically included a 6-speed manual and, depending on the specific engine variant and market, an automatic transmission. People often praise the Crafter for its practicality, cargo capacity, and relatively comfortable ride compared to some competitors. Common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with certain engine components and electrical systems, as well as the relatively high cost of repairs and maintenance.

**Engine**

**2.0L TDI Diesel (Various Outputs)**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, poor performance, and the engine management light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement or cleaning of the EGR valve. In severe cases, the EGR cooler might also need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF can become clogged, especially with frequent short journeys. This leads to reduced performance, warning lights, and potential limp mode.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (either through a service or a longer drive at higher speeds). If regeneration fails, the DPF may need cleaning or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, excessive smoke (often black), and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty injector(s). A diagnostic test will pinpoint which injectors are failing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (depending on number of injectors and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slipping, difficulty engaging gears, clutch pedal feeling spongy or sticking.
    *   Solution: Clutch kit replacement (including clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Automatic Transmission (Specific Variant Unknown)**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, transmission slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Could range from a fluid change and software update to valve body repair or complete transmission rebuild/replacement, depending on the severity. Requires diagnostics to determine root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sits lower than normal, potentially affecting handling and ride quality. In extreme cases, the leaf spring can crack or break.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (for a pair of leaf springs, including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors failing to lock or unlock remotely, or central locking system malfunctioning intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check wiring, fuses, and the central locking module. May require module replacement or repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Failure (Diesel Engines)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, engine misfires when cold, and engine management light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty glow plug(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, sticking, or requiring excessive force.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the runners and hinges. If the problem persists, the rollers or hinges may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Warning Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Illumination of warning lights with no apparent cause.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic code reading and repairs to corresponding system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Volkswagen Crafter, while offering practicality and space, can suffer from a range of issues. Engine problems, particularly relating to the EGR valve, DPF, and injectors in the diesel engines, are fairly common. Transmission issues can also arise, especially in the automatic variants. Suspension and electrical problems add to the potential maintenance burden. The severity and cost of these issues vary greatly, from relatively minor repairs to potentially expensive component replacements.
