The 2014 Volkswagen Crafter is a versatile and popular van known for its practicality, spacious cargo area, and relatively good fuel economy for its class. Common engine options include the 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine, offered in various power outputs, and the 2.5-liter TDI diesel engine. Transmission choices typically consist of a 6-speed manual and an optional automatic gearbox. Owners appreciate the Crafter's reliability, comfortable driving position, and functional design. However, some common complaints include issues with the EGR valve, turbocharger problems, and electrical glitches. The 2.0 TDI engine produces around 107-161 horsepower, depending on the variant, with torque figures ranging from 221-295 lb-ft.

**Engine**

**2.0L TDI Diesel**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine management light illumination, reduced power, limp mode, excessive smoke, and potential engine stalling. The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, preventing it from functioning correctly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or whistling noise from the engine bay, loss of power, increased fuel consumption, black smoke from the exhaust, and engine management light illumination. Can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, excessive smoke (white or black), poor fuel economy, and potential engine management light illumination. Caused by wear, contaminated fuel, or electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Injector replacement or cleaning (if possible).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L TDI Diesel**

*   **Camshaft Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, reduced performance, difficulty starting, and potential engine management light illumination.
    * Solution: Camshaft replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage (engine revs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed), difficulty shifting gears, a high clutch pedal, and a burning smell. Can be caused by normal wear and tear, aggressive driving, or oil contamination.
    *   Solution: Clutch kit replacement (including clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Synchro Wear**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sitting lower than the front, reduced ride height, and potential impact on handling and stability. Overloading the van can accelerate this issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, poor handling, and longer stopping distances.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors not locking or unlocking properly, intermittent failure, or complete system failure. Can be caused by a faulty door lock actuator, wiring issues, or a problem with the central locking control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the electrical system, including replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Volkswagen Crafter, while generally reliable, can suffer from issues common to vans of its age and usage. The most prevalent issues involve the engine (EGR valve, turbocharger, injectors on the 2.0 TDI and camshaft wear on the 2.5 TDI), transmission (clutch and synchro wear), and electrical system (central locking, glow plugs). Repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to more costly overhauls, depending on the severity and component affected. The most expensive repairs typically involve turbocharger replacement, transmission rebuilds, and engine component failures. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle's service history and look for signs of these common issues before purchasing.
