### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Volkswagen Crafter is a capable commercial vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine-related problems like turbocharger failure and EGR valve issues on the TDI engines, along with clutch wear or DSG mechatronic unit problems in transmissions, are the most significant concerns. Suspension components, particularly bushings and ball joints, can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical faults, such as alternator failure, and exterior rust are also points to inspect. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these areas represent the most likely sources of repair costs beyond standard maintenance for this model year.
