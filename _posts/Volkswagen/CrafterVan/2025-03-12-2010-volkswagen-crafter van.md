The 2010 Volkswagen Crafter is a light commercial vehicle known for its practicality and spacious cargo area. Engine options include a range of 2.5-liter TDI diesel engines with varying power outputs, such as 88 hp, 109 hp, 136 hp, and 163 hp. The 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine with 109 hp and 140 hp options are also available. Transmission options primarily include a 6-speed manual gearbox, with some models possibly offering an automatic transmission (though less common).
