The 2012 Volkswagen Crafter van is a popular choice for tradespeople and businesses needing a reliable and spacious commercial vehicle. While known for its practicality and robust build, it's not without its potential issues. The 2012 Crafter typically came with a range of diesel engine options, including various outputs of the 2.0L TDI and the 2.5L TDI. For example, the 2.0L TDI could be found with around 109 hp or 136 hp and varying levels of torque. The 2.5L TDI usually came with around 163 hp. Transmission options were primarily a 6-speed manual or an automatic transmission, depending on the engine and market. Owners often appreciate the Crafter's large cargo capacity, comfortable driving position, and overall durability. Some common dislikes include potentially higher running costs due to fuel consumption and potential maintenance needs, which will be listed below.

**Engine**

**2.0L TDI**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or crankshaft seals. Symptoms include visible oil puddles under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail due to oil starvation, wear and tear, or foreign object damage. Symptoms include a loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and a whining or screeching noise from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L TDI**

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**

The 2012 Volkswagen Crafter van, while generally reliable, can experience certain issues. Engine problems like oil leaks and turbocharger failures in the 2.0L TDI, and EGR valve/injector issues in the 2.5L TDI can be costly. Transmission problems such as clutch failure and synchro wear can also add to the cost of ownership. Owners should also be aware of suspension bushing wear, electrical glitches, and potential sliding door problems. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more significant and require substantial investment.
