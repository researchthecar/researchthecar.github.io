**Summary**

The 2018 Volkswagen Crafter is a capable van, but owners have reported a variety of issues. Engine issues, such as EGR valve and DPF problems, along with electrical issues like infotainment system malfunctions are common and can be costly to fix. Suspension issues and transmission problems, especially in the automatic variants, also contribute to potential expenses. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or DPF replacements, can be significant investments. Addressing these potential issues proactively with regular maintenance can help to mitigate the risk and cost of repairs.
