**Engine**

**2.0-Liter TDI Diesel**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, reduced engine power, increased emissions, and the engine management light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become blocked, especially with frequent short journeys. Symptoms include reduced engine power, the DPF warning light illuminating, and potentially the engine entering limp mode.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF (performed by a mechanic), cleaning the DPF, or complete replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine, loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and the engine management light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Summary**

The 2015 Volkswagen Crafter can present owners with a range of issues, from minor electrical glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. EGR and DPF issues are relatively common on the diesel engines. Suspension components can wear out, and the central locking system and sliding doors may experience malfunctions. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, but addressing them promptly is crucial for maintaining the van's reliability and longevity. Some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, while others, such as turbocharger or transmission replacements, can be costly.
