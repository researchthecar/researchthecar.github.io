### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Volkswagen Tiguan presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.0L turbocharged engine is the most prone to issues, with common problems including PCV valve failure, turbocharger wear, and timing chain tensioner concerns, which can be costly to repair. The 2.5L engine and manual transmission are generally more robust. Automatic transmission issues, such as fluid leaks and mechatronic unit problems, can also arise. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and the infotainment system, are also noted. While not universally problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection, especially for models with the 2.0T engine and automatic transmission.
