The 2014 Volkswagen Tiguan is a compact SUV known for its sporty handling and upscale interior, but also for its relatively small cargo space and somewhat firm ride. Common engine options include a 2.0L TSI turbocharged inline-4 engine that produces 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. This engine was offered with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its European driving dynamics and stylish design, while others find the fuel economy lacking and the reliability questionable compared to its competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L TSI Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The old revision of the timing chain tensioner (primarily found on earlier models but possible on a 2014) can fail, leading to timing chain slack. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon startup, especially after the car has been sitting for a while. If left unresolved, it can lead to catastrophic engine damage due to jumped timing.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner with the updated revision. Consider replacing the timing chain and guides as well if there is evidence of wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and if the chain/guides need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light. Often, a code indicating a misfire on a specific cylinder (e.g., P0301 for cylinder 1) will be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all four at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on if you replace one or all of them.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV Valve Failure**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, erratic gear changes, getting stuck in gear, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the mechatronic unit or attempt to repair it. Requires specialized knowledge and tools.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on repair vs. replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Vague steering and uneven tire wear can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found
