### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Volkswagen Tiguan presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.0L turbocharged engine, while offering good performance, is susceptible to issues like PCV valve failure and carbon buildup, which can be costly to address. The automatic transmission also has documented problems with solenoids and the mechatronic unit. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and the infotainment system, are also noted. However, the suspension and exterior/interior components generally hold up well. The manual transmission variant appears to be more robust. Owners should be prepared for potential powertrain and electrical repairs, especially as the vehicle ages, but the core structure and driving experience remain strong points.
