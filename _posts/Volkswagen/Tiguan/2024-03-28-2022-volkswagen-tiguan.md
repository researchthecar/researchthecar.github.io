**Introduction:**

The 2022 Volkswagen Tiguan is a compact SUV available with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include an 8-speed automatic or a 7-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic. The Tiguan is praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and advanced safety features.

The severity of the issues varies, with some being more urgent and costly than others. It's important to note that not all vehicles will experience these problems, but it's essential to be informed about potential issues before making a purchase.
