**Engine**

**2.0L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Determining the cause of excessive oil consumption is critical. The first step is often to monitor the oil level diligently over a set mileage interval. Dealerships may perform an oil consumption test to quantify the issue. If the problem is due to faulty piston rings or valve stem seals, replacement of these components is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the source of the oil consumption).

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may experience a rough idle, misfires, loss of power, and the check engine light may illuminate. Diagnostic codes will typically indicate a misfire in a specific cylinder.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting between gears, particularly at lower speeds. This can manifest as a noticeable jolt or clunk during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, inspection and possible replacement of valve body components or solenoids may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150+ (software update); $500 - $2,000+ (valve body/solenoid replacement)
