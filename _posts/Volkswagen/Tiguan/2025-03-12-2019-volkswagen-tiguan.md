The 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan is a popular compact SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available third-row seating (on FWD models). The standard engine is a 2.0L TSI turbocharged inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the Tiguan's practicality and features, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, engine hesitation, and certain mechanical problems. The 2019 model year aims to address some prior-year concerns, but specific issues persist.

**Engine**

**2.0L TSI Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke (in severe cases), and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: The fix varies. Start with checking for external leaks, then performing an oil consumption test. If consumption is excessive and no external leaks are found, replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbocharger failure can result in a significant loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling), and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Aisin)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. Some experience hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes improve shifting performance. In some cases, valve body replacement may be necessary. If the issue is severe, a transmission replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $4,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, especially when accelerating or going up hills. Engine RPMs rise without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and fill may temporarily resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Fluid Flush) - $4,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings). Symptoms include clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace the worn bushings. In some cases, the entire control arm may need to be replaced if the bushings are not available separately.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can suffer from various glitches, including freezing, slow response times, screen blackouts, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1000+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle is left unused for a few days. This can result in difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested to ensure it is holding a charge. Check for parasitic draws in the electrical system. In some cases, a faulty module or component may be causing the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Battery Replacement) - $500+ (Diagnosing and Fixing Parasitic Draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with the sunroof, including leaks, difficulty opening or closing, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Inspect and clean the sunroof drains. Lubricate the sunroof tracks. In some cases, the sunroof motor or other components may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: The solution is dependent on what is causing the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+

**Summary**

The 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan, while generally a practical and well-rounded SUV, is prone to certain issues. Engine-related problems, such as excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failure, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, like harsh shifting and hesitation, are also relatively common and can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system, are a frequent source of frustration for owners. While some issues can be addressed with software updates or minor repairs, others may require more extensive and expensive work. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used Tiguan before purchase.
