The 2022 Volkswagen Tiguan is a compact SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 184 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. While many owners appreciate its practicality and fuel efficiency, some common complaints include infotainment system glitches and occasional sensor malfunctions.

**Engine**

**2.0L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, loss of power, check engine light illuminated, potentially excessive oil consumption.
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warning light frequently illuminating, noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust (in severe cases).
    * Solution: A possible repair is to replace the piston rings, which may involve significant engine disassembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant level dropping, visible coolant on the ground near the engine, engine overheating, sweet smell from the engine bay.  Possible locations include the water pump, thermostat housing, and radiator hoses.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking component (water pump, thermostat housing, hose, etc.).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the location and component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Aisin)**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable clunking or jerking during gear changes, particularly at lower speeds, sometimes accompanied by hesitation.
    * Solution: A software update/reflash of the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush or replacement may be recommended. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or full transmission replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reflash) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Delayed Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into Drive or Reverse and the vehicle actually moving.
    * Solution: Similar to harsh shifting, a TCM reflash or fluid change may help. A more in-depth diagnostic might be needed to rule out internal transmission damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reflash) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine revving high but not translating into acceleration, feeling like the transmission is "slipping" between gears.
    * Solution: This can indicate more serious internal damage and may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Bushing Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.  Poor handling or steering response.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn bushings. Common areas include control arm bushings and sway bar bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the bushing location and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto malfunctions.
    * Solution: Software updates can often resolve these issues. In some cases, a system reset or replacement of the infotainment unit might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    * Description/Symptoms: False alarms, failure to detect objects, error messages on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor and replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle failing to start after being parked for short periods, needing to jump-start the car frequently.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Possible causes include faulty modules, accessories that aren't turning off, or a failing battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Issues**

**Summary**

The 2022 Volkswagen Tiguan, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues. Engine issues such as turbocharger failure and excessive oil consumption can be costly to repair. The 8-speed transmission can suffer from harsh shifting and slipping. Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system, are a nuisance. Premature suspension bushing wear and sunroof problems are also areas to watch. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing.
