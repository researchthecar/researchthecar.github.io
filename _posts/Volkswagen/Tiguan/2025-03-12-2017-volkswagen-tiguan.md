The 2017 Volkswagen Tiguan is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride and decent cargo space. For the 2017 model year, the Tiguan was equipped with a single engine option: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Tiguan's responsive handling and available all-wheel drive, while others find the fuel economy and limited rear passenger space to be drawbacks. Common complaints also involve premature water pump failure, electrical glitches, and interior trim issues.
