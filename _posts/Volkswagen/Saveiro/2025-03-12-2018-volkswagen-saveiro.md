The 2018 Volkswagen Saveiro is a subcompact pickup truck primarily sold in South America. It's known for its practicality and affordability, making it a popular choice for small businesses and personal use. Engine options typically included a 1.6L inline-4 engine, with different states of tune offering around 101-104 horsepower and 105-114 lb-ft of torque, depending on the fuel used (gasoline or ethanol). The Saveiro is often praised for its car-like handling and maneuverability in urban environments, while some owners find the ride quality and interior materials less refined. Common complaints often revolve around the reliability of certain components and the availability of parts outside of its primary market.
