The 2017 Volkswagen Saveiro is a compact pickup truck primarily sold in South America. It's available with a 1.6-liter inline-4 engine producing around 101 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque (petrol) or 104 horsepower with 119 lb-ft of torque (ethanol) when properly equipped. It comes exclusively with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate its affordability, utility, and maneuverability in urban environments. Criticisms often revolve around its basic features, limited rear passenger space (in double cab versions), and relatively low power output.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4 Petrol/Ethanol**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand kilometers.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and using the recommended oil type can help mitigate the issue. In severe cases, a mechanic should diagnose the cause, which could range from worn piston rings or valve seals to a faulty PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause, ranging from a few dollars for a PCV valve to hundreds or thousands for major engine work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light. Often diagnosed with a code indicating a cylinder misfire.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil. It is recommended to replace all coil packs at the same time to prevent future failures
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200 per coil pack, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Certain Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or resistance when attempting to shift into first or reverse gear, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable. If the issue persists, the transmission may require internal inspection and repair, potentially involving replacement of synchros.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$150 for clutch cable adjustment, $500-$1500+ for transmission repair or rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension bushings. Polyurethane bushings may offer longer life but can increase road noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$400 per corner, depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable sagging in the rear suspension, especially when carrying loads. Reduced load-carrying capacity and potential for bottoming out.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider heavy-duty springs if regularly carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+ for leaf spring replacement, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failing Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door not locking or unlocking, even with the key fob or the interior button.
    *   Solution: Replace the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 per door, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Window Regulator**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window not rolling up or down, or moving slowly and erratically.
    *   Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400 per window, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Development**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust spots appearing on body panels, especially in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Address rust promptly by sanding, treating, and repainting affected areas. Prevention through regular washing and waxing is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ per panel, depending on the severity of the rust and the quality of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noises coming from the dashboard, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Trace the source of the rattle and secure loose components. This may involve adding foam padding or tightening screws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+, depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Interior Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Interior lights not turning on or off, or flickering intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check the bulbs and replace if necessary. If the issue persists, investigate the wiring and switches.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10-$50 for bulb replacement, $50-$200+ for wiring or switch repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Volkswagen Saveiro, while generally reliable for its intended purpose, does have some common issues. The engine can suffer from oil consumption and coil pack failures, while the manual transmission may exhibit shifting problems. Suspension components can wear prematurely, and electrical gremlins like door lock actuator failures can occur. Rust is also a potential concern. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity. Engine and transmission repairs can range from a few hundred to over $1,000, depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
