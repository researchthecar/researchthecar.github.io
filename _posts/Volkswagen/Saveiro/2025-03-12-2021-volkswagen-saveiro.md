**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every few thousand kilometers and visible blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    *   Solution: In less severe cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil might help. More serious cases could require piston ring replacement or even engine overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks originating from the water pump or radiator. Can cause overheating and low coolant levels.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty water pump or radiator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Certain Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported difficulty shifting into first or second gear, especially when cold. This can manifest as a notchy or grinding feeling when attempting to engage the gear.
    *   Solution: The issue is commonly caused by worn synchros. A transmission rebuild or replacement is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ depending on the shop and whether a rebuild or replacement is chosen.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The clutch may slip, especially under heavy load or during acceleration. This results in the engine revving higher than normal without a corresponding increase in speed.
    * Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of the suspension bushings, particularly in the front control arms. This can lead to clunking noises over bumps, reduced handling precision, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings. In some cases, it might be more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 per side, depending on the components replaced and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear shock absorbers may fail prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride and reduced stability, especially when carrying a load.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working or operate erratically due to a faulty window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may intermittently fail, causing doors to not lock or unlock properly with the remote or interior switch.
    * Solution: Replacement of the door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Prone Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners in areas with high humidity or road salt usage have reported rust forming on body panels, particularly around the wheel arches and lower door sections.
    *   Solution: Repairing and repainting the affected areas to prevent further corrosion. Applying rustproofing treatments can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per panel, depending on the extent of the rust and the quality of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**
