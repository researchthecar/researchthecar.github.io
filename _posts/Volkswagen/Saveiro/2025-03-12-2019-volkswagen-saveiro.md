The 2019 Volkswagen Saveiro is a subcompact utility pickup truck primarily sold in South American markets. It's known for its affordability, versatility, and fuel efficiency. Engine options for the 2019 model typically include a 1.6L inline-4 gasoline engine. Specific horsepower and torque figures vary slightly depending on the trim and market, but generally range around 101-110 horsepower and 110-114 lb-ft of torque. The Saveiro is appreciated for its compact size that makes it easy to maneuver in urban environments, its car-like driving dynamics, and its practical bed for hauling cargo. Some common complaints revolve around its basic interior, limited rear passenger space (depending on the cab configuration), and somewhat underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded. Available transmissions are typically a 5-speed manual or an automated manual.
