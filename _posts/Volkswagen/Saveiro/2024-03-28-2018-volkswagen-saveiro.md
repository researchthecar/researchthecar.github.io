The 1.6-liter inline-four engine produces 110 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The Saveiro is known for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and affordable pricing, but it has also been reported to have some common issues.

**Engine**

**1.6L Inline-Four**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak. This can lead to rough idling, stalling, and decreased engine performance. **Solution:** Replace the intake manifold gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400

* **Rear Suspension Leaf Spring Failure:** The rear suspension leaf springs can fail, causing the vehicle to sag and handle poorly. **Solution:** Replace the rear suspension leaf springs. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $500

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely, especially when the vehicle is parked for an extended period. **Solution:** Check for parasitic drains and rectify. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $200
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to not charge. **Solution:** Replace the alternator. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $400 - $600

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** The headlights can develop condensation inside, which can obstruct visibility. **Solution:** Replace the headlight housing. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400
* **Tailgate Hinge Corrosion:** The tailgate hinges can corrode, causing the tailgate to stick or not open properly. **Solution:** Clean and lubricate the hinges, or replace them if necessary. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $300
* **Fuel Filler Door Release Failure:** The fuel filler door release can fail, preventing the fuel filler door from opening. **Solution:** Replace the fuel filler door release. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $200

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Rattle:** The dashboard can develop a rattle, especially on rough roads. **Solution:** Identify the source of the rattle and apply sound deadening material. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $50 - $200

* **Air Conditioner Compressor Failure:** The air conditioner compressor can fail, causing the air conditioning system to not cool properly. **Solution:** Replace the air conditioner compressor. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $600 - $1,000

**Summary:**

The 2018 Volkswagen Saveiro is a relatively affordable and fuel-efficient pickup truck, but it is not without its issues. Engine problems, especially with the intake manifold gasket and timing chain tensioner, can be serious and expensive to fix. Some transmission issues, such as shift solenoid and torque converter failure, can also be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical issues are generally less severe and less expensive to fix. However, some interior problems, such as seat belt pretensioner failure, can be safety concerns and may require immediate attention. Overall, while the Saveiro offers some advantages, potential buyers should be aware of the potential issues it can experience before making a purchase decision.
