The 2012 Volkswagen Saveiro is a light pickup truck primarily sold in South America. It's based on the Volkswagen Gol platform and is known for its practicality, affordability, and versatility as a work vehicle. The 2012 model typically came with a 1.6L inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 101-104 horsepower and 105-114 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific fuel (gasoline vs. ethanol blends).

Owners generally appreciate the Saveiro for its fuel efficiency and cargo capacity, but some criticize its basic interior and relatively small engine size.
