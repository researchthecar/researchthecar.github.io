The 2014 Volkswagen Saveiro is a compact pickup truck primarily sold in South America. This specific model year offered several engine options, but the most prevalent is the 1.6L inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 101-104 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque, depending on the fuel (gasoline or ethanol). This engine is typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. The Saveiro is often praised for its utility, affordability, and maneuverability in urban environments. Common criticisms include its relatively basic features, limited rear passenger space (in cabin models), and ride quality.
