The 2013 Volkswagen Saveiro is a compact pickup truck primarily sold in South America. It's known for its versatility and affordability, often used as a work vehicle but also suitable for everyday driving. Two engine options were available: a 1.6L 8V inline-4 engine producing around 101 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque (Gasoline), and a 1.6L 8V inline-4 engine producing around 104 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque (Ethanol). Both engines are typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. People often appreciate the Saveiro for its practicality, decent fuel economy, and car-like handling. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space (in the extended cab models) and relatively basic interior features.

**Summary**

The 2013 Volkswagen Saveiro, while a practical and affordable vehicle, has its share of common issues. Engine-related problems, such as excessive oil consumption, and fuel injector issues, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, particularly those related to shifting, also appear. Suspension and electrical problems are also present. Rust is a common issue in areas with high humidity, so it's also important to inspect the body. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with potential costs ranging from a few dollars for minor parts to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and address these issues before buying.
