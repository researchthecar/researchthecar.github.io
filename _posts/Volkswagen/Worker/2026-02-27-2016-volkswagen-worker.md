### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volkswagen Worker demonstrates a generally reliable profile for a commercial vehicle, with most reported issues concentrated in specific engine and transmission variants, particularly the DSG automatic. Common concerns include EGR valve and turbocharger issues on diesel engines, and mechatronic unit failures in the DSG transmissions. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear over time, as expected for a work vehicle. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and wiring harness problems are also noted. Exterior and interior components are less prone to widespread technical failures, with door lock actuators and HVAC blower motors being occasional points of concern. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can significantly mitigate these potential issues and ensure the longevity of the vehicle.
