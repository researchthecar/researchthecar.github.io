The 2017 Volkswagen Worker is a fictional vehicle, therefore, I cannot provide specific and accurate information regarding common issues, complaints, recalls, or repair costs. As the vehicle is made up, there are no reliable sources for this information. To provide accurate data, I would need access to real-world data on vehicle issues from sources like NHTSA, consumer reports, and repair databases.
