**Engine**

**2.0L TSI (EA888) Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, decreased performance, and poor fuel economy. Direct injection engines like the 2.0T TSI are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves because there is no fuel washing the valves to clean them.
    * Solution: Manual cleaning (walnut blasting) or chemical cleaning of the intake valves.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, engine temperature warning light. The plastic water pump housing can crack over time, leading to coolant loss.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump, thermostat (often replaced together), and coolant. Upgraded aftermarket metal impeller water pumps are available and can be more reliable.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

* **Diverter Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, reduced acceleration, and possible engine hesitation. The diverter valve, which recirculates excess boost pressure, can fail due to a torn diaphragm.
    * Solution: Replace the diverter valve. Upgraded aftermarket options are also available.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbo, loss of power, excessive oil consumption, and possible smoke from the exhaust. The turbocharger can fail due to bearing wear or oil starvation.
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Slipping/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting, and eventual clutch failure. Aggressive driving or modifications can accelerate clutch wear.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

**6-Speed DSG (DQ250) Dual-Clutch Automatic**

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough shifting, delayed engagement, gear selection issues, and error codes. The mechatronic unit controls the DSG's shifting functions.
    * Solution: Replace or rebuild the mechatronic unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

* **DSG Clutch Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, jerky shifts, and shuddering. The DSG clutches can wear out over time, especially with aggressive driving or improper maintenance.
    * Solution: Replace the DSG clutches.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+

**Suspension**

* **Adaptive Damper Failure (DCC - Dynamic Chassis Control)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride quality, clunking noises, and error messages. The adaptive dampers can fail, causing the suspension to become overly stiff or bouncy.
    * Solution: Replace the affected damper.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per damper

* **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Humming or grinding noise that increases with speed, vibration in the steering wheel, and play in the wheel.
    * Solution: Replace the wheel bearing and hub assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per wheel

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: System freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation errors.
    * Solution: Software updates (if available), replacement of the infotainment unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the car, and parasitic drain.
