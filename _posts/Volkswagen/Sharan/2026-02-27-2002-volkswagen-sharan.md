### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Volkswagen Sharan presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's ancillary components (like oil and coolant leaks), specific transmission problems (especially with the automatic gearbox), and wear on suspension parts such as bushings and ball joints. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and central locking, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on the vehicle's history and climate. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into ownership costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are crucial for maintaining the Sharan's functionality.
