### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Volkswagen Sharan presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanicals, particularly the TDI engines, can be robust if well-maintained, they are prone to issues like turbocharger problems, EGR valve clogging, and injector pump faults. Transmission reliability varies, with manual gearboxes susceptible to clutch wear and potential gearbox issues, while automatics can suffer from torque converter or valve body problems. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and central locking, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate and maintenance. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor are also known to fail. Overall, the Sharan requires diligent maintenance and awareness of these common issues to ensure continued reliability.
