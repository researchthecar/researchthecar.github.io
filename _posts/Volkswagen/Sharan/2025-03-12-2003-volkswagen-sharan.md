The 2003 Volkswagen Sharan is a spacious and versatile MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) known for its practicality and comfortable ride. Common engine options include the 1.9L TDI diesel engine (available in various power outputs, typically ranging from 90 to 115 horsepower and corresponding torque figures), and the 2.0L gasoline engine. Transmission choices usually consist of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed or 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often appreciate the Sharan's ample interior space, flexible seating arrangements, and overall reliability. However, common complaints revolve around age-related wear and tear, particularly with suspension components, electrical issues, and turbocharger problems (specifically in the TDI models).
