### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Volkswagen Sharan offers a practical and spacious package, but potential buyers should be aware of common reliability concerns. The diesel engines, particularly the 2.0L TDI, are susceptible to DPF and turbocharger issues, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions may exhibit rough shifting. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and central locking problems are also noted. While suspension components can wear, this is common for vehicles of this age and type. Interior rattles can be an annoyance. Overall, the Sharan can be a good value if well-maintained, but expect potential expenses related to its diesel powertrain and electrical systems.
