Owners have generally praised the Sharan's spaciousness, comfort, and driving dynamics but have noted reliability concerns in some areas.

**Engine**

**2.0L Diesel**

* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Leaking or clogged fuel injectors result in engine misfiring, rough idle, and reduced power. Replacement of injectors required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
* **Turbocharger Issues:** Turbocharger failure or boost leaks can cause reduced engine performance or excessive smoke. Turbocharger replacement or repair necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Problems:** Faulty EGR valve leads to reduced engine efficiency and increased emissions. EGR valve replacement along with cleaning the intake manifold is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,000+

**1.9L Diesel**

* **Injector Pump Failure:** Malfunctioning injector pump results in engine stalling, difficulty starting, and reduced power. Injector pump replacement required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+

**1.8T Gasoline**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Worn or faulty timing chain tensioner can cause rattling or grinding noises from the engine and potentially lead to engine damage. Replacement of timing chain and tensioner required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
* **Intake Manifold Flap Problems:** Faulty or sticking intake manifold flaps cause engine performance issues, such as hesitation or stumbling during acceleration. Replacement or repair of intake manifold required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,000+

**2.8L Gasoline**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Hydraulic Line Failure:** Leaking or damaged clutch hydraulic line resulting in a soft or unresponsive clutch pedal. Clutch hydraulic line replacement required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Dual Mass Flywheel (DMF) Failure:** Worn or broken DMF causes shuddering, vibration, or rattling noises during acceleration. Replacement of DMF required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** Faulty torque converter causes shuddering or vibrations during gear shifts. Torque converter replacement or repair required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
* **Valve Body Issues:** Malfunctioning valve body leads to rough shifting, delayed shifts, or transmission slipping. Valve body repair or replacement required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+

**5-Speed Automatic (1.9L Diesel)**

* **Shift Solenoid Problems:** Faulty shift solenoids cause delayed or harsh shifting. Shift solenoid replacement required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Transmission Fluid Pump Failure:** Failed transmission fluid pump results in loss of fluid pressure, leading to transmission failure. Transmission fluid pump replacement required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
