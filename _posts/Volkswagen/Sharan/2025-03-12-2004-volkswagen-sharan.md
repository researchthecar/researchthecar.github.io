    *   Solution: This can sometimes be mitigated by using a higher viscosity oil, however a more permanent solution may involve piston ring replacement or valve stem seal replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the extent of the repair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.9L TDI Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, black smoke from the exhaust, and a whistling noise from the turbocharger area.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. It's often advisable to replace the oil feed lines at the same time to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
