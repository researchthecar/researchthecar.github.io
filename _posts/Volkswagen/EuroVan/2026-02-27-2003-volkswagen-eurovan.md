### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Volkswagen EuroVan is a capable vehicle with a generally solid mechanical foundation. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as coolant flange leaks and oil leaks from valve cover gaskets on the VR6 engine. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, can be costly if not addressed early. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are common wear items that require attention. Electrical gremlins, especially with window regulators and instrument clusters, can occur. Exterior rust is a concern for vehicles in certain climates, and interior wear on seats and HVAC issues like blower motor resistors are also noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these specific problem areas will contribute significantly to the long-term reliability of the EuroVan.
