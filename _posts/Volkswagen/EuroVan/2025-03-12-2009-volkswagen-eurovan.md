The 2009 Volkswagen Routan, marketed as a minivan, is essentially a rebadged Chrysler Town & Country/Dodge Grand Caravan. It came with a 4.0L V6 engine producing 251 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. It was only available with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its spacious interior and comfortable ride, but common criticisms include its bland styling and perceived lack of Volkswagen character, as well as some of the reliability issues inherited from its Chrysler-based design.
