The 2008 Volkswagen Routan, despite being marketed as a rebadged Chrysler Town & Country/Dodge Grand Caravan, does share some common components and thus potential issues. It comes with a 4.0L V6 engine producing 251 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Routan for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and features like the Stow 'n Go seating. However, some criticisms include its uninspired styling (being so similar to the Chrysler minivans) and potential reliability concerns stemming from its Chrysler-based design.
