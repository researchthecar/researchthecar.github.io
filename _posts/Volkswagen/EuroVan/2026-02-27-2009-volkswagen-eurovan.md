### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volkswagen EuroVan presents a range of potential issues, with the engine and transmission being the most common areas for significant repairs. Diesel variants are prone to DPF and EGR problems, while gasoline engines can suffer from coolant leaks and timing chain wear. Automatic transmissions may develop torque converter issues. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and HVAC resistors, are not uncommon. Exterior rust and interior wear are also factors to consider. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the EuroVan's utility outweighs these concerns, provided regular maintenance and awareness of common failure points.
