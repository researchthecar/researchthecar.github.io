The 2007 Volkswagen EuroVan, also known as the Transporter T5 in many markets, is a versatile van known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. While it wasn't officially sold in North America after 2003, some were privately imported and comply with US standards. The most common engine option for this model year is a 2.5L inline-5 cylinder gasoline engine, producing around 115 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission were available. Owners often appreciate the EuroVan's practicality, ample cargo space, and comfortable seating, making it suitable for families and camper conversions. However, common complaints include maintenance costs, some reliability issues, and the van's size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces.
