The 2004 Volkswagen EuroVan, also known as the Transporter T4 in some markets, is a versatile van appreciated for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and unique Westfalia camper configuration. It's powered by a 2.8L VR6 engine producing 201 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its practicality for camping and road trips, its relatively smooth ride for a van, and its distinctive styling. Conversely, common complaints include its age-related maintenance needs, fuel economy, and the limited availability of parts compared to more common vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2004 Volkswagen EuroVan, while beloved for its versatility and unique features, is prone to age-related issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly with cooling system leaks, ignition coils, and transmission shifting, are common. Suspension components also wear out, leading to ride and handling issues. Electrical problems, especially with power windows and the central locking system, can be frustrating. Interior issues like headliner sagging are also typical. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes for minor issues to significant expenses for major repairs like transmission overhauls. Due to the age of the vehicle, regular maintenance and proactive repairs are essential to keep it running reliably.
