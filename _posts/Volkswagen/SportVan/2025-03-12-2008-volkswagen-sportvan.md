The 2008 Volkswagen SportVan, also known as the Golf Plus in some markets, offered a practical and versatile option for families needing extra space and a higher driving position than a standard hatchback. Engine options varied depending on the market but often included a range of petrol and diesel engines. Although I can't guarantee the engines and transmissions will be the same in every market, I can provide some options: a 1.6L petrol engine producing around 102 horsepower and approximately 110 lb-ft of torque and a 1.9L TDI diesel engine that produces around 105 horsepower and approximately 184 lb-ft of torque were common in Europe. A 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission were also common options. Owners often appreciate the SportVan's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency (especially the diesel models). Common complaints include the uninspired styling, potentially expensive repairs (especially electrical issues), and the relatively high cost of parts.

**Summary**

The 2008 Volkswagen SportVan can be a practical and comfortable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine problems, particularly with coil packs, EGR valve and DPF issues with the diesel models, and electrical faults can be costly. Transmission issues, especially those related to the valve body and torque converter in the automatic transmission, can also lead to significant repair bills. Suspension wear and tear is typical for a vehicle of this age. Addressing these issues proactively can help maintain the SportVan's reliability and extend its lifespan. The severity of the issues range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs varying accordingly. Electrical and transmission repairs tend to be the most expensive.
