The 2018 Volkswagen Crafter is a popular choice for businesses and individuals needing a spacious and versatile van. It typically comes with a range of diesel engine options. One popular engine option is the 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine, which produces around 140 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available were variations of the 2.0 TDI with different power outputs. Transmission choices include a manual gearbox and an automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Crafter's large cargo capacity, comfortable ride, and relatively fuel-efficient diesel engines. However, some common complaints revolve around electrical issues, the reliability of certain components, and the van's overall cost compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L TDI Diesel Engine**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, poor performance, increased emissions, and the engine management light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the EGR valve is the most common fix. Cleaning might temporarily resolve the issue, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogging is a common problem, especially in vehicles used primarily for short journeys. Symptoms include reduced power, warning lights, and the engine going into limp mode.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration by a mechanic or DPF replacement. Changing driving habits to include longer, higher-speed journeys can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (forced regeneration) - $1500+ (DPF replacement)

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging (especially in heavily loaded vans)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension sagging, particularly when the van is consistently loaded with heavy cargo. This can lead to reduced ride comfort, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Upgrading the rear springs or adding air suspension to provide additional support.

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as those related to the ABS system, tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), and engine management, can fail or provide inaccurate readings. This can trigger warning lights and affect vehicle performance.
    *   Solution: Identifying and replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the sensor)
