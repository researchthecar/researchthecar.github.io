### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volkswagen Crafter demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core mechanicals when maintained properly. The most frequently reported issues tend to revolve around the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) system, especially under urban driving conditions that limit regeneration cycles. Turbocharger and EGR valve issues can also arise with higher mileage. For automatic transmissions, the DSG system's mechatronic unit and clutch packs are potential points of concern. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are subject to wear due to the vehicle's load-carrying nature. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor faults, are not uncommon. While exterior and interior issues are generally minor, they can impact user experience. Proactive maintenance and addressing DPF warnings promptly are key to maximizing the Crafter's longevity and minimizing unexpected repair costs.
