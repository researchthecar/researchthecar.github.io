### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volkswagen Crafter demonstrates good overall reliability for a commercial vehicle. The primary areas requiring attention are the diesel particulate filter (DPF) and EGR valve, common to many modern diesel engines, and potential issues with the DSG automatic transmission's mechatronics unit or clutches. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear over time, especially under heavy use. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain or sensor failures, are also noted but not excessively prevalent. With diligent maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging issues, the Crafter should provide dependable service.
