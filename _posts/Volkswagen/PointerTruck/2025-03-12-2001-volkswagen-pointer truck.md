The 2001 Volkswagen Pointer Truck, also known as the Saveiro in some markets, was a compact pickup truck primarily sold in Latin America. The 2001 models typically came with a 1.6L inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 98 horsepower and 90 lb-ft of torque. This engine was generally paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Pointer Truck for its affordability and utility as a light-duty work vehicle. However, common complaints include its basic features, limited safety equipment, and potential reliability issues due to its age.
