The 2007 Volkswagen Pointer Truck, primarily sold in Mexico and South America, offered a practical and affordable solution for light-duty hauling. Engine options typically included a 1.8L inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 100 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often praised the truck for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability in urban environments. However, common complaints revolved around its relatively basic features, limited cargo capacity, and susceptibility to rust in certain climates. The 2007 model year may have been the last year of production for the Pointer Truck, or one of the last.
