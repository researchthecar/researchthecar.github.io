### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Volkswagen Constellation demonstrates solid reliability for its class, with most reported issues stemming from heavy-duty usage rather than inherent design flaws. Powertrain components like the DPF and EGR valve on the 1.9L engine, and turbochargers/injectors on the 2.4L, are the most common areas requiring attention, often related to operational demands. Transmission issues, particularly with the clutch on manual gearboxes and actuators on AMTs, are also noted. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can experience wear. Electrical systems, particularly wiring harnesses, require vigilance against corrosion. While exterior rust and interior HVAC or infotainment glitches can occur, they are generally less critical. Overall, with proactive maintenance and addressing specific component vulnerabilities, the Constellation remains a dependable workhorse.
