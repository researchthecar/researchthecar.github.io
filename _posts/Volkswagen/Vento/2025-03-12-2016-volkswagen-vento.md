The 2016 Volkswagen Vento, also known as the Polo Sedan in some markets, is a subcompact sedan known for its build quality and comfortable ride. In India, the 2016 Vento was offered with three engine options: a 1.6L MPI petrol engine (105 PS and 153 Nm of torque), a 1.2L TSI petrol engine (105 PS and 175 Nm of torque), and a 1.5L TDI diesel engine (105 PS and 250 Nm of torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 7-speed DSG automatic (only with the 1.2L TSI and 1.5L TDI). Owners often praise the Vento for its solid construction and handling, but some criticize its relatively basic interiors and the cost of maintenance. Some drivers have found the DSG transmission unreliable.
