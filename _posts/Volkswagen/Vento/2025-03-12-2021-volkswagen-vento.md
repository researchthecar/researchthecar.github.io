The 2021 Volkswagen Vento, primarily sold in India and other select markets, is a subcompact sedan known for its solid build quality and comfortable ride. A popular engine choice is the 1.0-liter TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) petrol engine, producing around 108 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque, often paired with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Vento for its spacious interior and robust construction, while others find the styling somewhat dated and the feature list not as comprehensive as some competitors. While this model is no longer in production, it remains on the used car market.
