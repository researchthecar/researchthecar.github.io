The 2017 Volkswagen Vento is a subcompact sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior for its class. Engine options for the 2017 Vento typically include a 1.6-liter MPI petrol engine (around 105 hp and 153 Nm of torque) and a 1.5-liter TDI diesel engine (around 105 hp and 250 Nm of torque). Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 7-speed DSG automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often praise the Vento for its build quality and relatively spacious cabin, but some common complaints include the cost of maintenance and occasional electrical issues.

**Engine**

**1.5L TDI Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogging, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and warning lights on the dashboard. This is particularly common in vehicles used primarily for short trips where the DPF doesn't get hot enough to regenerate.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration by a mechanic using diagnostic tools, or DPF replacement if regeneration is not possible.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can cause rough idling, stalling, poor acceleration, and the check engine light to come on. This is more common on vehicles with higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L MPI Petrol**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, decreased power and fuel economy, and a check engine light indicating a misfire.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed DSG Automatic**

*   **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky shifting, delayed engagement, slipping, failure to shift, and warning lights on the dashboard. The Mechatronic unit controls the shifting process and can be prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the Mechatronic unit. This is a complex repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Pack Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping between gears, and difficulty engaging gears. The clutch packs within the DSG can wear prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and increased tire wear may also be observed.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn bushings, such as control arm bushings or sway bar bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors not locking or unlocking properly with the remote or key, intermittent failures of the central locking system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing faulty door lock actuators, wiring, or the central locking control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to operate, operating slowly, or getting stuck.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Rattles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing loose components or adding sound dampening material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the complexity of the repair and if performed at a shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Volkswagen Vento, while appreciated for its ride and interior space, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The diesel engine can be prone to DPF and EGR valve problems, while the DSG transmission is known for potential Mechatronic unit and clutch pack failures, both of which can be expensive to repair. Electrical issues and suspension bushing wear are also common complaints. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially expensive repairs. Buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed, paying close attention to the transmission, engine, and electrical systems.
