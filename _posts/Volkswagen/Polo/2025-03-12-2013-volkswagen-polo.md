The 2013 Volkswagen Polo is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, practicality, and surprisingly refined driving experience for its size. Engine options include a range of petrol and diesel engines, with the popular 1.2-liter TSI petrol engine producing around 105 horsepower and a respectable amount of torque for city driving. Gearbox options usually consist of a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 7-speed DSG (dual-clutch) automatic transmission, depending on the engine. Owners generally appreciate the Polo's build quality, comfortable interior (for its class), and nimble handling. Some common dislikes include the relatively small rear seats and the potential for higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors, especially concerning the DSG transmission.
