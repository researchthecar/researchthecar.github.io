The 2004 Volkswagen Polo is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and nimble handling. Engine options varied depending on the market, but commonly included a range of gasoline and diesel engines. A popular choice was the 1.4L gasoline engine. The 1.4L engine is a 4-cylinder engine making around 75 horsepower and 93 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Polo's compact size, making it easy to maneuver in urban environments and park in tight spaces. Fuel economy is also a strong selling point.
