### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volkswagen Polo demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its naturally aspirated petrol engines and manual transmissions. The turbocharged TSI engines, while offering better performance, have a documented tendency for timing chain wear and potential turbocharger issues, which can be costly to repair. The DSG automatic transmission, though smooth, can be prone to mechatronic unit failures or clutch wear. Diesel models may encounter DPF-related problems. Electrical issues are generally minor, often related to the infotainment system or occasional battery drain. For prospective buyers, prioritizing models with well-maintained TSI engines or opting for manual transmissions can mitigate some of the higher-risk repair possibilities.
