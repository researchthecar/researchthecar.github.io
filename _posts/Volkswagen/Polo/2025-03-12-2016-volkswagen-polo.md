The 2016 Volkswagen Polo is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, practicality, and comfortable ride. Engine options for the 2016 Polo typically include a range of gasoline and diesel engines, such as a 1.2L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) petrol engine producing around 90 horsepower and 118 lb-ft of torque, or a 1.4L TDI diesel engine. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 7-speed DSG (Direct-Shift Gearbox) dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the Polo's build quality and agile handling, but some criticize its relatively high price compared to competitors and the limited rear passenger space.
