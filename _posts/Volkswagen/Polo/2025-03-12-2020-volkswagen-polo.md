The 2020 Volkswagen Polo is a popular subcompact car known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. In many markets, it was offered with a range of engines including the 1.0L MPI, 1.0L TSI, and 1.5L TSI petrol engines. Some models also came with a 1.6L TDI diesel engine. Power output varied depending on the engine, but the 1.0L TSI typically produced around 95-115 horsepower and 118-148 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 7-speed DSG automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Polo's refined interior, nimble handling, and available technology. Common dislikes include its relatively high price compared to competitors and the somewhat limited rear passenger space.
