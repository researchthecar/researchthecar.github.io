The 2006 Volkswagen Polo, a subcompact hatchback, was known for its practicality and European build quality. Engine options for this year included a range of petrol and diesel engines, such as the 1.4L petrol engine producing around 75 horsepower and a 1.9L TDI diesel. Transmission options were generally a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level.
