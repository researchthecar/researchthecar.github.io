Available engine options include a 1.0-liter MPI engine producing around 80 horsepower, a 1.0-liter TSI engine with around 95 or 110 horsepower, and a 1.5-liter TSI engine delivering around 150 horsepower. Transmission choices generally include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, or a 7-speed DSG automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often praise the Polo for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and well-equipped interior for its class.
