The 2019 Volkswagen Polo is a subcompact car known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and relatively comfortable ride for its class. Engine options typically include a range of gasoline and diesel engines, such as the 1.0L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) petrol engine, often producing around 95-115 horsepower and corresponding torque figures. Transmission options usually include a manual transmission and a DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox) automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Polo's agile handling and modern features, but some dislike the relatively small rear seat space and some reports of infotainment glitches.
