The 2015 Volkswagen Polo is a subcompact car known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a range of gasoline and diesel engines. One of the popular choices is the 1.2-liter TSI four-cylinder gasoline engine, producing around 90 horsepower and 118 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include naturally aspirated 1.0-liter and 1.2-liter gasoline engines, as well as a 1.4-liter TDI diesel. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 7-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic.
