The 2004 Volkswagen Beetle is a retro-styled compact car that was offered with a few different engine options. The most common was the 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4, and a 1.9L TDI diesel engine.
