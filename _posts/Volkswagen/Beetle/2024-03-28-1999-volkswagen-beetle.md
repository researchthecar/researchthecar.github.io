**Introduction:**

The 1999 Volkswagen Beetle is a retro-inspired compact car that pays homage to the original Beetle produced from 1938 to 2003. It was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine is a 2.0-liter inline-four producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. An optional 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-four produces 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. The base transmission is a 5-speed manual, while a 4-speed automatic is optional. The Beetle was praised for its stylish design and fun-to-drive handling but criticized for its cramped interior and lack of features.
