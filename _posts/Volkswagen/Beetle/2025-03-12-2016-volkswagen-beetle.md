The 2016 Volkswagen Beetle offers a retro-inspired design with a touch of modern flair. The two engine options available are a 1.8L TSI inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L TSI inline-4 producing 210 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Beetle's unique styling, fuel efficiency (with the 1.8L engine), and comfortable ride. However, some common dislikes include the limited rear passenger space, and some complaints about reliability issues.
