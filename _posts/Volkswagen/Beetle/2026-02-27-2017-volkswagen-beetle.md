### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volkswagen Beetle presents a generally acceptable reliability record for its class, with the most common concerns centering around the turbocharged engines and automatic transmissions, particularly the DSG. Issues like PCV valve failures and turbocharger problems can be costly but are not universal. The automatic transmissions, especially the DSG, may require attention for shifting issues or mechatronic unit problems. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and power window issues, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components tend to be robust. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early warning signs are recommended for owners to ensure longevity and minimize potential repair expenses.
