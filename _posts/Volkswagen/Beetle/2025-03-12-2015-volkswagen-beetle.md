The 2015 Volkswagen Beetle offered a unique blend of retro styling and modern features. Available engine options included a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 producing 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L TDI diesel engine producing 150 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual (only with the 1.8T early in the model year), 6-speed manual (with the 1.8T later in the model year), and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Beetle's distinctive design, comfortable ride, and available features. Common criticisms include limited rear passenger space and a relatively small cargo area.

Summary:

The 2015 Volkswagen Beetle can be a fun and stylish vehicle, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly oil leaks and ignition coil failures in the 1.8T, can be relatively common. The TDI diesel engine has its own set of potential problems related to the DPF, EGR, and HPFP, which can be expensive to fix. Transmission issues with the 6-speed automatic can also lead to significant repair costs. Suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior problems are generally less severe but can still be a source of frustration. Overall, prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems before making a purchase.
