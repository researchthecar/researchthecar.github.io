### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Volkswagen Beetle, while charming, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to center around the engine (particularly ignition coils and MAF sensors on the 2.0L, and PCV/turbo on the 1.8T), the automatic transmission (torque converter and TCM), and suspension components like control arm bushings. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and HVAC resistors, are also noted. Exterior and interior issues are generally less severe but can impact comfort and usability. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to reported symptoms are crucial for maintaining the longevity and reliability of this distinctive vehicle.
