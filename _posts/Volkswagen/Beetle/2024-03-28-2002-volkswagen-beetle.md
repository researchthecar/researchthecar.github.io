**Introduction**

The 2002 Volkswagen Beetle is a retro-styled compact car that evokes the iconic design of the original Volkswagen Beetle produced from 1938 to 2003. It was available with two engine options and two transmission options. The base engine was a 2.0-liter inline-four producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-four producing 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic transmission.

Praise for the 2002 Volkswagen Beetle includes its stylish and distinctive design, its affordability, and its fun-to-drive nature. Criticisms include its cramped rear seat, its noisy cabin, and its lack of modern features.
