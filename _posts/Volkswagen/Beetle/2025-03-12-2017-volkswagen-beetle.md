The 2017 Volkswagen Beetle is a stylish and iconic compact car, offered in both coupe and convertible body styles. Most models are equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 174 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. A 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque was available earlier in the model year. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Beetle's distinctive retro design, comfortable ride, and available features. Some common complaints include a relatively small back seat and trunk space, as well as the discontinuation of a manual transmission option for this model year.
