### Summary Verdict

The 2.5L engine is known for potential oil leaks and ignition coil issues, while the 2.0L TSI can experience PCV system problems and water pump leaks. Automatic transmission issues often manifest as harsh shifting, and manual transmissions may require clutch replacement over time. Suspension components like struts can wear out, leading to a less comfortable ride. Electrical gremlins, such as power window malfunctions and infotainment glitches, are also noted.
