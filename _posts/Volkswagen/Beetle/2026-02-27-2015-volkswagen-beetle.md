### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volkswagen Beetle demonstrates a respectable reliability record, particularly with its manual transmission options. The turbocharged gasoline engines, while offering good performance, have some documented issues such as PCV valve failures and water pump leaks, which are not uncommon for turbocharged engines. The DSG automatic transmission, while smooth, has a higher potential for costly repairs related to its mechatronic unit and clutch packs. Electrical gremlins, primarily concerning the infotainment system and power windows, are also noted. Overall, the Beetle is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific powertrain and transmission reliability differences and factor in potential repair costs for the DSG transmission.
