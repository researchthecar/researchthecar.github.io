The 2012 Volkswagen Beetle marked a reimagining of the iconic car with a more aggressive and masculine design than its predecessor. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-5 cylinder engine (170 hp and 177 lb-ft of torque), a turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 (200 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque), and later in the model year, a 2.0L TDI diesel engine. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic for the 2.5L, a 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic for the 2.0T, and a 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG for the 2.0 TDI. Owners often praised the Beetle's distinctive styling, improved handling compared to earlier models, and the availability of a fuel-efficient diesel engine. Common complaints centered around the smaller rear seats, limited cargo space, and some reported reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2012 Volkswagen Beetle can be a stylish and enjoyable car, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the timing chain on the 2.0T and DPF on the 2.0 TDI, can be costly. Transmission issues, especially with the DSG, also warrant careful inspection. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive to repair, so a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
