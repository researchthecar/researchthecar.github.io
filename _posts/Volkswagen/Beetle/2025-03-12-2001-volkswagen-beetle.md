The 2001 Volkswagen Beetle is a retro-styled compact car that offered a nostalgic take on the iconic original Beetle. For 2001, engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine producing 150 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. People often appreciate the Beetle for its unique design, fuel efficiency, and ease of parking. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space, relatively small cargo area, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2001 Volkswagen Beetle can be a fun and stylish car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems, particularly oil and coolant leaks on the 2.0L and turbocharger/coil pack issues on the 1.8T, are frequent. The 4-speed automatic transmission is also a known weak point. Electrical issues and minor interior problems add to the list of potential repairs. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others like turbocharger or transmission replacement can be costly. Careful inspection and maintenance are essential to keep a 2001 Beetle running reliably.
