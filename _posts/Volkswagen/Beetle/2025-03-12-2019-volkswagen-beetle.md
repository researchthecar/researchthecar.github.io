The 2019 Volkswagen Beetle, the final model year of the iconic vehicle, came equipped with a single engine option: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 174 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Beetle's distinctive styling, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some criticisms include limited rear passenger space and cargo capacity, as well as a perceived lack of performance compared to some competitors.
