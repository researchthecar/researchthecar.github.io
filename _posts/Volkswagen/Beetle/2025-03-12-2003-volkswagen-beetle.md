The 2003 Volkswagen Beetle is a quirky and iconic vehicle known for its distinctive retro styling. Available engines included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 rated at 150 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (primarily paired with the 2.0L engine) and a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic (primarily paired with the 1.8T engine). Owners often appreciate the Beetle's unique appearance and fuel efficiency. Dislikes include the limited rear passenger space and occasionally quirky reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Coolant Temperature Sensor Failure**
