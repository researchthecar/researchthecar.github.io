**Introduction**

The 2004 Volkswagen Beetle is a retro-styled compact car that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produced 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. A 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder was also available, producing 150 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a five-speed manual, a six-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT).
