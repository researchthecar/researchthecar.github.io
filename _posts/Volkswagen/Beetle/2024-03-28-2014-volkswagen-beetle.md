## 2014 Volkswagen Beetle

The 2014 Volkswagen Beetle is a compact car available in coupe and convertible body styles. It is powered by a 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine (170 horsepower, 177 pound-feet of torque) paired with a six-speed manual or automatic transmission.

The Beetle is praised for its iconic design, retro styling, and fun-to-drive nature. However, it has been criticized for its lack of rear-seat space, firm ride, and subpar fuel economy.
