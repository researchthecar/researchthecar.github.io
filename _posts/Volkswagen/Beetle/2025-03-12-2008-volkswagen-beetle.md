The 2008 Volkswagen Beetle, a retro-styled compact car, offered a blend of nostalgia and modern features. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-5 cylinder producing 150 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. A turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 producing 200 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque paired with either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG. Owners appreciated the Beetle's distinctive styling and comfortable ride, but some disliked its limited rear seat space and occasionally quirky electrical issues.
