### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volkswagen Beetle, while charming, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the electrical system, particularly window regulators and HVAC components. Engine-wise, ignition coils and MAF sensors are frequent culprits on gasoline models, while TDI engines can experience glow plug and EGR valve problems. Automatic transmissions, specifically the 01M, are more prone to issues like torque converter and TCM failures than their manual counterparts. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly can help mitigate more significant problems, making it a potentially rewarding ownership experience for those aware of its quirks.
