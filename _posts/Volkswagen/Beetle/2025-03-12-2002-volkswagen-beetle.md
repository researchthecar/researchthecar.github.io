The 2002 Volkswagen Beetle is a retro-styled compact car that aimed to recapture the charm of the original Beetle. Available engines included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Beetle's distinctive design and fuel efficiency. However, some common complaints include reliability issues and cramped rear seating.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks often originate from the plastic coolant flange located on the side of the cylinder head or from the water pump. Symptoms include a low coolant level warning light, visible coolant leaks under the car, and engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coolant flange or water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oxygen sensors (O2 sensors) can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, a check engine light, and rough running.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Turbo Inline-4**

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light can be caused by failing ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all four at the same time.
