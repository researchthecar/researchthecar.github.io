### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Volkswagen Cabrio is a charming convertible that can provide enjoyable ownership, but potential buyers and owners should be aware of common issues. The 2.0L engine can experience cooling system and oil leaks, while both manual and automatic transmissions have documented problems, with the automatic being more prone to costly repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are typical wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. The convertible top mechanism and body rust are significant concerns for this model. While not inherently unreliable, proactive maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended to mitigate potential repair costs.
