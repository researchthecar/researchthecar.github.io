The 2000 Volkswagen Cabriolet is a four-seat convertible known for its affordability and classic design. This model year typically features a 2.0-liter inline-four cylinder engine producing around 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Cabrio's simple mechanics, easy top-down experience, and distinctive styling. Common dislikes include the modest performance, dated interior, and potential for age-related mechanical issues typical of cars from this era.
