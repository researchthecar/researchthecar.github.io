### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volkswagen Caddy generally presents a reliable profile, especially with its manual transmission variants and well-maintained diesel engines. The TDI engines, while capable, can be susceptible to issues like DPF clogging and EGR valve problems, particularly if driven primarily in urban environments. The DSG automatic transmission, while offering convenience, has a higher potential for costly repairs related to its mechatronic unit and clutches. Suspension components are typical wear items for a vehicle of this type, with ball joints and bushings being the most common culprits for noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain or sensor failures, are not uncommon but are usually diagnosable and repairable. Overall, the Caddy is a solid choice, but prospective buyers should be aware of the specific engine and transmission combinations and their associated potential issues.
