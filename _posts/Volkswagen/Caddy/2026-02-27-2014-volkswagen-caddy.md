### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Volkswagen Caddy generally presents good reliability, especially with its diesel engines. The 1.6L and 2.0L TDI engines are robust but can be susceptible to EGR valve issues and DPF clogging, respectively, which are common in many modern diesels. The 7-speed DSG transmission, while offering convenience, has a higher potential for costly mechatronic unit failures. Manual transmissions are typically more reliable. Suspension components and general electrical issues are not uncommon with age and mileage, but are generally repairable. Rust can be a concern on older models, particularly in vulnerable areas. Overall, the Caddy is a dependable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of specific transmission and diesel particulate filter considerations.
