### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volkswagen Caddy generally presents a reliable profile, with the diesel TDI engines being the most common variants and also the source of some specific, albeit manageable, issues like DPF and EGR problems. The petrol TSI engines can be susceptible to timing chain wear. Automatic DSG transmissions, while offering convenience, carry a higher risk of costly mechatronic unit or clutch pack failures. Suspension components like shocks and bushings are typical wear items but can become problematic if neglected. Electrical gremlins, particularly battery drain, are not uncommon. Overall, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights, the Caddy can be a dependable workhorse.
