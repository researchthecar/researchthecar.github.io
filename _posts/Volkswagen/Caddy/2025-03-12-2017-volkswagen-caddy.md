The 2017 Volkswagen Caddy is a versatile small van, popular for both commercial and personal use. Engine options for the 2017 Caddy include a range of petrol and diesel engines. A common petrol engine is the 1.4 TSI, producing around 125 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. Diesel options often include the 2.0 TDI, available in different power outputs. Transmission choices typically consist of a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, or a 6-speed DSG (dual-clutch) automatic. Owners often praise the Caddy for its practicality, spacious cargo area, and car-like driving experience. Common criticisms include the relatively basic interior, higher price compared to some rivals, and occasional reports of reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0 TDI Diesel**

* **DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, DPF light illumination, loss of power, and potential limp mode. This is often caused by short journeys that don't allow the DPF to reach the required temperature for proper regeneration, or due to a faulty sensor.
    * Solution: Forced DPF regeneration by a mechanic, DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement. Addressing underlying causes such as faulty sensors or driving habits.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the solution: forced regeneration vs. replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) Valve Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from exhaust, engine management light illumination. The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to malfunction.
    * Solution: EGR valve cleaning or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.4 TSI Petrol**

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise on start-up, particularly from the engine, indicating a stretched or worn timing chain. Can eventually lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed DSG (Dual-Clutch) Automatic**

* **Mechatronic Unit Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Jerky shifting, hesitation when accelerating, difficulty engaging gears, error messages on the dashboard related to the transmission. The mechatronic unit controls the hydraulic functions of the DSG.
    * Solution: Mechatronic unit repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Clutch Pack Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Slipping during acceleration, particularly in higher gears, shuddering during gear changes, reduced performance. The dual-clutch design means two clutches are used, and they can wear over time.
    * Solution: Replacement of the clutch packs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging (if equipped)**
