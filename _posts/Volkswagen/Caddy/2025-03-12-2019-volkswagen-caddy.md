The 2019 Volkswagen Caddy is a popular compact panel van, known for its practicality, reliability, and car-like driving experience. Engine options for the 2019 Caddy included various TDI diesel engines and TSI petrol engines. One common engine is the 2.0 TDI diesel, producing around 102-150 horsepower and 250-340 Nm of torque, depending on the specific variant. Transmission options usually consist of a 5 or 6-speed manual, or a 6 or 7-speed DSG automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Caddy's versatility, fuel efficiency (especially the diesel models), and comfortable ride. However, some criticisms often include the relatively basic interior, higher price point compared to some competitors, and potential for costly repairs, especially related to the DSG transmission.

**Summary**

The 2019 Volkswagen Caddy, while generally reliable, can experience issues common to modern vehicles, particularly with the diesel engine's emission control systems and the DSG transmission. EGR valve and DPF problems in the diesel engine can lead to performance issues and costly repairs. The DSG transmission, while offering smooth shifting, is susceptible to Mechatronic unit and clutch pack failures, which are also quite expensive to repair. Other issues, such as suspension problems and electrical malfunctions, are less common but still need to be considered. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect the vehicle's service history before making a purchase.
