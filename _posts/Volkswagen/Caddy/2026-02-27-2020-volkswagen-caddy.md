### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Volkswagen Caddy demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its petrol engines and manual transmissions. The diesel variants, while efficient, can experience issues with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and AdBlue systems, which are common to many modern diesels and may require specific maintenance or repair. The DSG automatic transmission can occasionally suffer from mechatronic unit problems. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and sensors, are also noted but not widespread. For owners who prioritize practicality and are mindful of potential diesel emissions system maintenance, the Caddy remains a strong contender in the light commercial vehicle segment.
