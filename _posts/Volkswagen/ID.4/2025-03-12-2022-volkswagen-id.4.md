The 2022 Volkswagen ID.4 is an all-electric compact SUV that marked VW's serious entry into the EV market. It's powered by a rear-mounted electric motor (RWD) producing 201 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque in the base model. An optional dual-motor, all-wheel-drive (AWD) configuration bumps the power up to 295 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. The ID.4 is generally praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology (despite some initial software quirks). Common complaints often revolve around the infotainment system responsiveness and some material choices in the cabin.

**Electric Motor**

**RWD Single Motor**
* **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle enters a "turtle mode," significantly reducing power and speed. This is often accompanied by error messages on the dashboard. This can happen even with sufficient battery charge.
    * Solution: Often requires a software update or, in some cases, replacement of the battery management system or other electrical components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update under warranty) to $1,000+ (if component replacement is required and not under warranty).
    * Recalls: None Found

**AWD Dual Motor**
* **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle enters a "turtle mode," significantly reducing power and speed. This is often accompanied by error messages on the dashboard. This can happen even with sufficient battery charge.
    * Solution: Often requires a software update or, in some cases, replacement of the battery management system or other electrical components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update under warranty) to $1,000+ (if component replacement is required and not under warranty).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **12V Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, which powers accessories and starts the car's systems, can drain prematurely, leading to starting issues or the infotainment system not functioning properly.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a technician to determine the cause of the parasitic drain. Possible solutions include software updates, replacement of the 12V battery, or repair of faulty modules causing the drain.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging/Rebooting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system is known for slow response times, freezing, or randomly rebooting. This can affect navigation, media playback, and climate control.
    * Solution: Software updates are the most common fix. In some cases, a full system reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update under warranty) to $500+ (if unit replacement is required and not under warranty).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Charging Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Problems with charging at home or at public charging stations, including slow charging speeds, charging errors, or complete failure to charge.
    * Solution: Check the charging equipment and electrical outlets first. If the issue persists, it may require a software update or a repair/replacement of the vehicle's charging components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update under warranty) to $500+ (if component replacement is required and not under warranty).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The AEB system may activate unnecessarily or fail to activate when needed.
    * Solution: Software update or sensor recalibration/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update under warranty) to $300+ (if sensor replacement or recalibration is needed and not under warranty).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rear Hatch Alignment Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch may not align properly, leading to difficulty closing, excessive wind noise, or water leaks.
    * Solution: Adjustment of the hatch hinges and latch mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunction (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erroneous alerts or complete failure of parking sensors or blind spot monitoring systems.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and potential replacement or recalibration of the affected sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    * Solution: Locating and securing the source of the noise, often involving the addition of sound-deadening material or tightening of fasteners.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Volkswagen ID.4 has a few common issues, mostly revolving around the electrical components such as the infotainment system, 12V battery drain, and charging issues. The most severe issue would be the power reduction/turtle mode, as that will limit the vehicle's usefulness. The cost to fix these issues can range from free software updates to thousands of dollars if major component replacements are needed outside of the warranty period.
