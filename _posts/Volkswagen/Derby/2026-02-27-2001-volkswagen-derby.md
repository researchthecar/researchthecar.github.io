## Engine

### 1.4L MPI (AUB/BBZ)
**Ignition Coil Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination, reduced engine power.
- **Solution:** Replacement of faulty ignition coil(s).
- **Cost:** $100 - $250

**Coolant Temperature Sensor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Inaccurate temperature readings, poor fuel economy, engine overheating or running too cool, check engine light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the coolant temperature sensor.
- **Cost:** $75 - $150


### 1.6L MPI (AEH/AKL/APF)
**Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Hesitation during acceleration, rough idling, stalling, check engine light.
- **Solution:** Cleaning or replacement of the MAF sensor.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Manual (02A/02J)
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell, high clutch pedal engagement point.
- **Solution:** Clutch kit replacement (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $500 - $900


### 4-Speed Automatic (01M)
**Solenoid Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, transmission slipping, error codes related to solenoids.
- **Solution:** Replacement of faulty transmission solenoids.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700

**Torque Converter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering at low speeds, slipping, delayed engagement, potential fluid leaks.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the torque converter.
- **Cost:** $600 - $1000


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering, uneven tire wear, pulling to one side.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Strut Mount Bearing Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noises when turning the steering wheel, especially at low speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the strut mount bearings.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Electrical

### General Electrical System
**Window Regulator Failure**

### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Volkswagen Derby, while a generally dependable small car, exhibits common age-related issues. The engines, particularly the 1.4L and 1.6L MPI variants, can experience problems with ignition coils, coolant sensors, and MAF sensors. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, may require attention for clutch wear or automatic transmission solenoid/torque converter issues. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rod ends are prone to wear, leading to noise and steering issues. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument clusters, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Interior issues are typically minor, with HVAC blower resistors and seat fabric wear being the most common. Overall, the Derby is a reasonably reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of these potential repair areas, especially as the car ages.
