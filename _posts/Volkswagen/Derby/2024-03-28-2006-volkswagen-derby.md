## 2006 Volkswagen Derby

The 2006 Volkswagen Derby is a subcompact sedan that is no longer in production. It was available with a 1.4L 4-cylinder engine and a 5-speed manual transmission. The Derby was praised for its fuel efficiency and affordability, but it was criticized for its lack of power and features.

### Engine

**1.4L 4-cylinder**

* **Oil Leaks:** Oil leaks are a common problem on the 1.4L 4-cylinder engine. The leaks can occur from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include:
    * Oil spots under the vehicle
    * Low oil level
    * Engine knocking
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the timing of the engine's valves and pistons. If the timing belt fails, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include:

    * Increased fuel consumption
    * Solution: Clean the intake valves.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

### Transmission

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Gear Grinding:** Gear grinding is a common problem on the 5-speed manual transmission. The grinding occurs when the gears are not properly aligned, which can be caused by worn synchronizers or a bent shift fork. Symptoms include:
    * Difficulty shifting gears
    * Grinding noise when shifting gears
    * Solution: Replace the worn synchronizers or shift fork.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
* **Clutch Failure:** The clutch is a wear item that eventually needs to be replaced. Symptoms of clutch failure include:
    * Difficulty shifting gears
    * Slipping clutch
    * Burning smell
    * Solution: Replace the clutch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

### Suspension

* **Strut Failure:** The struts are an important part of the suspension system, and they can fail over time. Symptoms of strut failure include:
    * Rough ride
    * Leaking struts
    * Noise when driving over bumps
    * Solution: Replace the struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
* **Sway Bar Links:** The sway bar links connect the sway bar to the suspension. They can wear out over time, which can cause:
