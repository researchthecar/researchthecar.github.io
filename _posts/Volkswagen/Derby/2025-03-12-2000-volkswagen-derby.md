The 2000 Volkswagen Derby, primarily sold in Mexico, was a rebadged Volkswagen Polo Classic. It was favored for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. However, it was criticized for its basic features, modest performance, and relatively bland styling. The Derby came with a 1.8L inline-4 engine producing around 90 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It was only available with a 5-speed manual transmission.
