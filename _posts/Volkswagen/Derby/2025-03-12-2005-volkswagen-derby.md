The 2005 Volkswagen Derby is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets. It was essentially a rebadged Volkswagen Polo Classic. It generally came equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 115 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission was the most common option. Owners appreciate the Derby for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and relatively spacious interior for its class. Common complaints include its basic features, somewhat unrefined ride quality, and potential for rust in certain climates.
