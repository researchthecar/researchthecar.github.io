The 2001 Volkswagen Derby is a subcompact sedan primarily sold in Mexico. It was based on the Volkswagen Polo Classic and offered a practical and affordable transportation option. The most common engine option was a 1.8-liter inline-4 gasoline engine. This engine produced around 90 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. The Derby was generally praised for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and simple design. However, some common complaints included a lack of modern features, a relatively small interior, and basic safety equipment. The transmission options available were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

**Summary**

The 2001 Volkswagen Derby, while generally a reliable vehicle, exhibits common issues related to its age. Engine issues include rough idling and catalytic converter efficiency, and the transmission might experience harsh shifting or difficulty engaging gears. Suspension components like bushings and shock absorbers can wear out, leading to a less comfortable ride. Electrical problems with power windows and the central locking system are also common. Rust formation and interior deterioration such as dashboard cracking and headliner sagging can also occur. The cost of repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to more substantial expenses, depending on the severity of the problem.
