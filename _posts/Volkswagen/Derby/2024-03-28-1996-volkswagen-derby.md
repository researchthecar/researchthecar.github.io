## 1996 Volkswagen Derby

The 1996 Volkswagen Derby is a compact sedan offered with a choice of two engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 1.8-liter inline-four that produces 90 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine is a 2.0-liter inline-four that produces 115 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a standard five-speed manual transmission, while a four-speed automatic transmission is optional.
