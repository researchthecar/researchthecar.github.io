### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Volkswagen Panel van is a capable commercial vehicle with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly the TDI engines. However, as with many vehicles of this vintage, common issues tend to revolve around aging components. The TDI engines, while powerful, can be susceptible to head gasket and turbocharger issues, especially if not maintained meticulously. Manual transmissions are generally more reliable than the automatic variants, which can suffer from torque converter and valve body problems. Suspension components like ball joints and shocks are typical wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to wiring harness corrosion, and rust on body panels are also points to inspect. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known issues, the 2000 VW Panel can remain a dependable work vehicle.
