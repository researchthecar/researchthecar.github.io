The transmission could also suffer from clutch or slipping issues, depending on the type selected. Suspension components like the strut mounts were prone to failure, as were electrical components like the alternator and starter. Exterior and interior problems were less severe but could still be costly to fix, such as rusty tailgates and cracked dashboards. Despite these issues, the Panel remained a popular choice for businesses and families due to its ample space and fuel efficiency.
