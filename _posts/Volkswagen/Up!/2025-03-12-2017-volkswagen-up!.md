The 2017 Volkswagen Up! is a city car known for its compact size, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Engine options typically include a 1.0-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine, which may be offered in naturally aspirated or turbocharged forms. The naturally aspirated version produces around 60-75 horsepower and approximately 70-70 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tune. Transmission options usually consist of a 5-speed manual or an automated manual transmission (ASG). Owners often appreciate the Up!'s nimble handling, ease of parking, and low running costs. Common dislikes revolve around its basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and relatively underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded or driving uphill.

**Engine**

**1.0L MPI (Multi-Point Injection) Petrol Engine**

    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket or the oil pan gasket. Ensure proper tightening torque during reinstallation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can occur due to faulty ignition coils or spark plugs. Symptoms include rough idling, reduced power, and the engine warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the affected cylinder and replace the faulty ignition coil or spark plug. Check wiring for any damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.0L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) Petrol Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger may exhibit issues such as decreased boost pressure, whistling noises, or complete failure. This can result in reduced engine performance and increased fuel consumption.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage or wear. Replace the turbocharger if necessary, ensuring proper lubrication lines are clear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Carbon Buildup (Direct Injection)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the direct injection design, carbon buildup on the intake valves can occur. This can lead to rough idling, decreased performance, and increased emissions.
    *   Solution: Perform a carbon cleaning service on the intake valves. Chemical cleaning or manual walnut blasting may be used.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially first or reverse, can occur. This might be due to worn synchros or a misadjusted clutch cable.
    *   Solution: Inspect and adjust the clutch cable. If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be disassembled to replace worn synchros.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
