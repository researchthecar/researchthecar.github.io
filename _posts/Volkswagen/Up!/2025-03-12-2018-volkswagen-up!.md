The 2018 Volkswagen Up! is a city car known for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and compact size, making it ideal for urban environments. It generally receives positive reviews for its practicality and affordability. However, some owners find its small engine underpowered for highway driving and the rear seats cramped for adults on longer journeys. The 2018 Volkswagen Up! predominantly featured a 1.0-liter three-cylinder petrol engine, available in naturally aspirated (MPI) and turbocharged (TSI) variants. The MPI engine produced around 60-75 horsepower and approximately 70-70 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tune. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and an automated manual transmission (ASG).
