**Introduction:**

The 1991 Volkswagen Cabriolet is a compact convertible that was produced from 1989 to 1993. It was offered with two engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder and a 2.0L 4-cylinder. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 3-speed automatic. The Cabriolet was known for its stylish design, responsive handling, and fun-to-drive nature. However, like any vehicle, it has had its share of issues.
