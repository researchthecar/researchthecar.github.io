**2010 Volkswagen Beetle Cabrio**

The 2010 Volkswagen Beetle Cabrio is a convertible version of the popular Beetle coupe. It is offered with a choice of two engines: a 2.5L inline-five-cylinder engine with 170 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.0L turbocharged inline-four-cylinder engine with 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Beetle Cabrio is praised for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and fun-to-drive nature. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of rear seat space, limited cargo capacity, and high price.
