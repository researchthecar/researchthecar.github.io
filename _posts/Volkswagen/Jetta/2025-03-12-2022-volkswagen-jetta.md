The 2022 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan offering a blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and German engineering. The standard engine is a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 158 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. A sporty GLI version is available with a more powerful 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (on base models and the GLI) and an 8-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the Jetta's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel economy. Common criticisms include somewhat bland styling and a lack of engaging driving dynamics compared to some competitors.
