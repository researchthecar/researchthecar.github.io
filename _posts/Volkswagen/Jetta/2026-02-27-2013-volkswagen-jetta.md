### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Volkswagen Jetta presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline engines, particularly the 1.8L TSI, can experience coolant leaks and PCV issues. The 2.0L TDI diesel engine is more prone to emissions-related problems like DPF and EGR valve failures, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions, especially the DSG, have a notable risk of mechatronic unit failure. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical concerns primarily revolve around window regulators and infotainment system glitches. Overall, while the Jetta offers good value, potential buyers should be aware of these specific mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities, particularly those associated with the diesel engine and DSG transmission.
