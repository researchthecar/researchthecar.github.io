The 2012 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan known for its German engineering, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 (115 hp, 125 lb-ft torque), a 2.5L inline-5 (170 hp, 177 lb-ft torque), a 2.0L TDI diesel inline-4 (140 hp, 236 lb-ft torque), and a 2.0L TSI turbocharged inline-4 (200 hp, 207 lb-ft torque). Transmission options vary depending on the engine and trim level and include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, 6-speed automatic, and 6-speed DSG (dual-clutch) automatic. Owners often praise the Jetta's spacious interior, solid build quality, and fuel economy, particularly with the TDI engine. Common criticisms include a relatively bland interior design, some cost-cutting measures compared to previous generations, and potentially expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (Non-Turbocharged)**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the issue. Replacing the affected components is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Inline-5**

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light can indicate a failing ignition coil. Specific fault codes (e.g., P0300, P0301-P0305) may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil is the typical solution. It's often recommended to replace all five coils at the same time to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per coil (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, whistling noise from the engine bay, poor fuel economy, check engine light.
    * Solution: Identify and repair the vacuum leak by replacing cracked or damaged hoses, intake manifold gaskets or other components. Smoke testing can help pinpoint the leak.

    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L TDI (Diesel)**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent DPF regeneration cycles, and a DPF warning light can indicate problems with the diesel particulate filter.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a forced DPF regeneration can resolve the issue. In other cases, the DPF may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+

**Summary**

The 2012 Volkswagen Jetta can experience a range of issues, with the severity and cost varying depending on the engine, transmission, and specific component affected. Engine issues, particularly with the 2.0L TSI (timing chain tensioner) and 2.0L TDI (DPF, HPFP, fuel injectors) engines, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, especially with the 6-speed automatic and DSG transmissions, can also lead to significant expenses. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be major and impact the reliability and overall ownership experience. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems.
