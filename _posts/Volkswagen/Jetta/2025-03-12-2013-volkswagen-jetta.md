Transmission issues with both the automatic and DSG transmissions are also potential concerns. Other issues, such as electrical and suspension problems, are generally less expensive to address. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs potentially costing thousands of dollars. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are recommended.
