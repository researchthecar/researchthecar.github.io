### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volkswagen Jetta offers a compelling package, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with the turbocharged gasoline engines and automatic transmissions. Issues like carbon buildup and PCV valve failures are not uncommon for the 2.0T FSI, while the 2.5L can experience ignition coil problems. The 6-speed automatic transmission is more prone to torque converter and valve body issues than the manual. Diesel models may face DPF and EGR valve challenges. Electrical components like window regulators and HVAC blower motors are also noted areas for potential repair. While many Jettas are reliable, proactive maintenance and awareness of these common issues are key to a positive ownership experience.
