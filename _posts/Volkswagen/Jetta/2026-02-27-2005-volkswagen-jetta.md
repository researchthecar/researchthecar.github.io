### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Volkswagen Jetta presents a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline engines, particularly the 2.0T FSI, are prone to ignition coil and PCV issues, while the 1.9L TDI diesel can experience turbocharger and EGR valve problems. Automatic transmissions, specifically the 09G, have documented torque converter and valve body concerns. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also noted wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and HVAC resistors, are relatively common. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the Jetta to be a capable and enjoyable car when properly maintained, with many of the problems being addressable with moderate repair costs.
