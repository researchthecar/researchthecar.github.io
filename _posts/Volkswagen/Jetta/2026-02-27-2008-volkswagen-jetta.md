### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Volkswagen Jetta presents a mixed reliability picture, with its gasoline engines generally being more straightforward than the diesel variants. The 2.0L turbo FSI engine is prone to PCV valve issues and carbon buildup, while the 2.5L is more robust but can suffer from ignition coil failures. Diesel models, particularly the 1.9L TDI, are more susceptible to DPF and EGR valve problems, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions, specifically the 6-speed 09G, have documented issues with the torque converter and valve body. Manual transmissions are typically more reliable. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and HVAC resistors are also noted. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, potential buyers should be aware of these specific common issues, especially when considering the diesel engines and automatic transmissions.
