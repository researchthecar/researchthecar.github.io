**Summary**

The 2020 Volkswagen Jetta is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. The most concerning are potential engine problems like excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failure, along with transmission issues in the 8-speed automatic. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions can also be frustrating. Interior rattles and sunroof issues are less severe but can detract from the overall driving experience. The cost of repairs can range from relatively minor fixes to more substantial expenses, depending on the specific problem and whether it's covered under warranty. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
