### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Volkswagen Jetta, while offering a compelling package for its era, exhibits some common reliability concerns across its various configurations. The gasoline engines, particularly the 1.8T, can suffer from ignition coil and PCV issues. The TDI diesel engine is generally robust but can face turbocharger and glow plug problems. Automatic transmissions (01M) are more prone to issues like torque converter and valve body failures compared to the manual transmissions. Suspension components like control arm bushings and ball joints are typical wear items that require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster failures, are also noted. Proactive maintenance and awareness of these potential issues are key to maintaining a 2003 Jetta.
