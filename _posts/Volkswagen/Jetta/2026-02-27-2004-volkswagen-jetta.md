### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volkswagen Jetta offers a variety of powertrains, but reliability can vary. The 1.8T engine is prone to ignition coil and PCV issues, while the 2.0L can suffer from head gasket problems. Diesel variants, particularly the 1.9 TDI, are generally robust but can experience turbocharger and glow plug issues. Automatic transmissions, especially the 01M, are a known weak point and can be costly to repair. Manual transmissions are typically more reliable. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and dashboard display issues, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, while the Jetta can be an enjoyable car, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
