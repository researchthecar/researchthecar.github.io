The 2002 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan known for its German engineering, comfortable ride, and available TDI diesel engine. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4, a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4, and a 1.9L TDI diesel. The 1.8T engine produced around 180 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (primarily paired with the 2.0L) or a 5-speed automatic (primarily paired with the 1.8T and TDI). Owners often praise the Jetta for its fuel efficiency (especially the TDI), solid handling, and relatively upscale interior for its class. Common complaints revolve around electrical issues, maintenance costs, and certain engine-specific problems.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Coolant Migration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks into the oil pan causing milky oil, overheating, and potential engine damage. Often caused by a cracked cylinder head or head gasket failure.

**1.8L Turbocharged Inline-4 (1.8T)**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil passages become clogged due to poor maintenance or using the wrong type of oil, leading to turbocharger failure and/or engine damage. Symptoms include oil pressure warning lights, rough running, and turbocharger issues.
    *   Solution: Thorough engine flush, replacement of the turbocharger (if damaged), and a commitment to using high-quality synthetic oil with regular oil changes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ (depending on the extent of the damage and if the turbocharger requires replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idling, lean codes (engine running with too much air), and decreased fuel efficiency.
    * Solution: Locate and repair or replace damaged vacuum hoses.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.9L TDI Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**

**Summary**

The 2002 Volkswagen Jetta, while a comfortable and stylish compact car, is prone to several common issues related to its engine, transmission, electrical system, and suspension. Engine problems, particularly sludge buildup in the 1.8T and turbocharger failure in the TDI, can be costly to address. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulator and door lock module failures, are also frequent complaints. Suspension issues, like control arm bushing wear, impact handling and ride quality. While the cost of individual repairs may vary, addressing these issues can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars over the vehicle's lifespan.
