The 2007 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan known for its German engineering and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4, a 2.5L inline-5, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 (TSI). The 2.0L turbo engine produced 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 6-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the Jetta's solid feel and European driving dynamics, while some common complaints revolve around reliability issues and the cost of maintenance.

**Summary**

The 2007 Volkswagen Jetta, while praised for its driving experience, is susceptible to a range of issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 2.0L TSI (timing chain tensioner, diverter valve, cam follower), can be costly. Transmission issues with the 6-speed automatic (valve body, torque converter) are also common. Suspension and electrical problems, while less severe, contribute to the overall cost of ownership. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major engine failures. Repair costs vary widely depending on the issue, but can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
