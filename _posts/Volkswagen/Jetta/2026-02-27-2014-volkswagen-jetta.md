### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Volkswagen Jetta presents a mixed reliability profile depending on the chosen powertrain. The naturally aspirated 2.5L engine and manual transmissions are generally robust with few reported issues. However, the TSI engines can experience coolant leaks and PCV problems, while the TDI models are more prone to DPF and EGR system faults, often related to emissions control. Automatic transmissions, particularly the DSG, can be a source of significant expense due to mechatronic unit or clutch issues. Electrical components like the infotainment system and power window regulators are also areas where owners have reported problems. Overall, while the Jetta offers good value, potential buyers should be aware of the specific reliability concerns associated with certain engine and transmission combinations.
