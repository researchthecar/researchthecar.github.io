The 2016 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder (150 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque), a 1.8L turbocharged four-cylinder (170 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder (210 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque in the GLI). Transmission options varied depending on the engine, including a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, 6-speed automatic, and a 6-speed DSG automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Jetta's practicality and comfortable ride, but some dislike the relatively bland styling and occasional reliability concerns.

Engine problems, such as turbocharger failure (1.4L) and excessive oil consumption (1.8L), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the DSG in the GLI model, can also be a significant concern. Other issues like strut mount failures, electrical problems, and interior/exterior component malfunctions can add to the overall cost of ownership.

Repair costs range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the problem.
