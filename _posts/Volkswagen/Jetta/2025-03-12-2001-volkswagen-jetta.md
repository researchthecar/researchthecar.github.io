The 2001 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact car known for its German engineering, comfortable ride, and available TDI diesel engine. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.9L TDI diesel inline-4 producing 90 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (primarily with the 2.0L engine) or a 5-speed automatic (with the 1.8T and TDI). Drivers appreciate the Jetta's fuel efficiency (especially with the TDI), solid build quality, and precise handling. Common complaints revolve around electrical issues, some reliability concerns with specific engine components, and the cost of certain repairs.

**Summary**

The 2001 Volkswagen Jetta has several common issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical problems to more significant engine and transmission concerns. Engine issues are specific to the engine type with common problems including coolant leaks and oil leaks with the 2.0L inline 4, turbo failure, ignition coil failure, and vacuum leaks with the 1.8L inline 4 turbo, and turbo failure, injection pump issues, mass air flow sensor failure, and vacuum leaks with the 1.9L TDI. The 01M 4-speed automatic transmission is particularly known for its reliability issues, while both the 4-speed and 5-speed automatic transmissions can experience slipping and harsh shifting. Suspension issues, such as worn control arm bushings, are also common. Electrical problems, including window regulator and door lock actuator failures, are frequently reported. The cost of repairs can vary widely, but some engine and transmission repairs can be quite expensive. The Jetta is still a solid car but may require frequent repairs due to its age.
