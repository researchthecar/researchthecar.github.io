The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit shifting anomalies, often rectifiable with software updates. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. However, the manual transmission and the vehicle's suspension and exterior components have shown good durability. Overall, the Jetta is a sensible choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific potential repair areas and factor them into long-term ownership considerations.
