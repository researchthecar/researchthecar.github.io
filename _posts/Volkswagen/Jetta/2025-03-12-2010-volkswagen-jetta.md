The 2010 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan known for its German engineering, comfortable ride, and available TDI diesel engine. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 gasoline engine (115 hp, 125 lb-ft of torque), a 2.5L inline-5 gasoline engine (170 hp, 177 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L TDI diesel engine (140 hp, 236 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options varied depending on the engine, including a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a 6-speed DSG (dual-clutch) automatic. Owners often appreciate the Jetta's fuel efficiency, especially with the TDI engine, and its solid build quality. Common complaints include the somewhat bland interior styling and potential reliability issues, especially with some of the automatic transmissions and certain engine components.
