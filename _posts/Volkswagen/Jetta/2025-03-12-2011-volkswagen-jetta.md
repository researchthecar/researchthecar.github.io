The 2011 Volkswagen Jetta marked a significant redesign for the model, offering a more spacious interior and a focus on value. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L inline-5 producing 170 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L TDI diesel producing 140 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic for the 2.0L, a 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic for the 2.5L, and a 6-speed manual and 6-speed DSG (dual-clutch) for the TDI. Owners often praised the Jetta for its comfortable ride, spacious trunk, and fuel efficiency (especially the TDI). Common complaints included the cheaper interior materials compared to previous generations, the somewhat uninspired styling, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2011 Volkswagen Jetta has some known issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The TDI engine is vulnerable to HPFP and DPF failures, which can be very expensive to repair. The 2.5L engine can suffer from oil leaks and ignition coil failures, which are less expensive. The 6-speed automatic transmission can have valve body issues. Cracking dashboards are a common interior complaint. Potential buyers should consider these issues and factor in possible repair costs when evaluating the vehicle.
