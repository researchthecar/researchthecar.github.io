The 2009 Volkswagen Jetta offered a blend of European driving dynamics and practicality, making it a popular choice. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 TDI diesel engine producing 140 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L inline-5 gasoline engine, and a 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a 6-speed DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox) for some engine configurations. Owners often praised the Jetta's fuel efficiency (especially with the TDI), comfortable ride, and solid build quality. Common dislikes included some reliability concerns, especially with certain engine/transmission combinations, and relatively bland styling compared to some competitors.
