Transmission issues, especially with the DSG and automatic variants, can be costly if the mechatronic unit fails or if internal repairs are needed. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and power window problems, are also noted but typically manageable. Overall, routine maintenance and addressing early signs of potential issues can contribute to a dependable ownership experience for the 2017 Jetta.
