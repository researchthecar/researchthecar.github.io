**Introduction to the 2016 Volkswagen Jetta**

The 2016 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 150 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 180 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 210 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. The base transmission is a six-speed manual, while an eight-speed automatic is available as an option for all engines.

The Jetta is praised for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. However, it has been criticized for its lack of performance from the base engine, its uninspiring handling, and its cramped rear seats.
