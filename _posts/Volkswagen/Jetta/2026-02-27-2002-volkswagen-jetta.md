### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Volkswagen Jetta, while offering a compelling package for its era, exhibits some common reliability concerns across its various engine and transmission options. The turbocharged 1.8T engine is prone to ignition coil and PCV issues, while the naturally aspirated 2.0L can suffer from coolant leaks and oil consumption. The 1.9L TDI diesel is generally robust but can experience turbocharger and EGR problems. Automatic transmissions (01M) are more susceptible to torque converter and solenoid issues than the manual counterparts. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and dashboard displays, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are well-documented and repairable, making the Jetta a potentially good value if properly maintained and any existing problems are addressed.
