# 2007 Volkswagen Jetta

### Overview
The 2007 Volkswagen Jetta, while offering a comfortable ride and a refined interior for its class, presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. Owners have reported a number of common issues, particularly concerning the powertrain and electrical systems. The availability of various engine and transmission options means that reliability can vary significantly depending on the specific configuration. While some components are known to be robust, others require attention and can lead to costly repairs if not addressed promptly. Regular maintenance is crucial, but certain recurring problems necessitate a closer look at the vehicle's specific build.

## Engine

### 2.0L FSI (Naturally Aspirated)
**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Replacement of seals and gaskets (e.g., valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket).
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**PCV System Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Rough idle, check engine light, whistling noises, increased oil consumption.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) valve and associated hoses.
- **Cost:** $200 - $500


### 2.0L TFSI (Turbocharged)
**Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup; check engine light; potential severe engine damage if ignored.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and related components.
- **Cost:** $1000 - $2500

**High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Stalling, rough idle, misfires, check engine light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the HPFP.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning, requiring frequent top-ups.
- **Solution:** Can be due to worn piston rings or valve stem seals; may require engine rebuild or specific component replacement.
- **Cost:** $1500 - $4000+

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volkswagen Jetta's reliability is heavily dependent on its specific powertrain configuration. The turbocharged 2.0L TFSI engine is prone to significant issues like timing chain problems and oil consumption, which can be very expensive to repair. The naturally aspirated 2.0L FSI and the 2.5L engines are generally more reliable, though oil leaks can still occur. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 6-speed 09G, have a history of slipping and harsh shifting. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and HVAC resistors, are also frequently reported. Buyers should exercise caution and thoroughly inspect any 2007 Jetta, paying close attention to the engine and transmission history.
