### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volkswagen Jetta presents a mixed reliability profile. The 1.8L Turbo engine has some documented issues with coolant leaks and the PCV system, while the 2.0L TDI Diesel is more prone to DPF and EGR cooler problems, which can be costly. The automatic DSG transmission, while offering performance benefits, has a notable risk of mechatronic unit failure and clutch wear. The manual transmissions and the 2.0L Turbo engine (found in the GLI) appear to be more robust. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and power windows, are also reported. Overall, the Jetta can be a reliable car if potential buyers are aware of these specific vulnerabilities and factor in potential repair costs, especially for the diesel and DSG variants.
