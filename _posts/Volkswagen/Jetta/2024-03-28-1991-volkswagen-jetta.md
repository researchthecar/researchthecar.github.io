**Introduction**

The 1991 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and German engineering. It came with two engine options: a 1.8L 4-cylinder and a 2.0L 16-valve 4-cylinder, both paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed automatic transmission. Praised for its handling and performance, the Jetta also faced criticism for its cramped interior and lack of features.
