**Introduction:**

The 2019 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan available with a choice of two gasoline engines and two transmission options:

* **1.4L Turbocharged I-4:** 147 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque
* **2.0L Turbocharged I-4:** 228 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque

The 1.4L engine can be paired with a 6-speed manual transmission or an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.0L engine comes exclusively with the 8-speed automatic.

The Jetta has received praise for its spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and sharp handling. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of rear legroom and its somewhat dated interior design.
