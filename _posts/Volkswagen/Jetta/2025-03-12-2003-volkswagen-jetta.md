The 2003 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan known for its German engineering, comfortable ride, and available TDI diesel engine. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 (115 hp, 122 lb-ft), a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 (180 hp, 174 lb-ft), and a 1.9L TDI diesel inline-4 (90 hp, 155 lb-ft). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic (primarily with the 2.0L), and a 5-speed automatic (primarily with the 1.8T and TDI). Owners often praised the Jetta's fuel economy (especially the TDI), handling, and solid feel. Common complaints included reliability issues, particularly with electrical components and sensors, as well as some concerns about interior plastics.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (AVH/AZG)**

* **Coolant Temperature Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine may overheat, the temperature gauge may read incorrectly, or the check engine light may illuminate.
    * Solution: Replace the coolant temperature sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Vacuum Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a possible check engine light. Vacuum leaks often originate from cracked or brittle vacuum hoses.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace any cracked or damaged vacuum hoses.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the hose and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Turbo Inline-4 (AWP/AWW)**

* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, loss of power, and a flashing check engine light. This engine is known for coil pack failures.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s). It's often recommended to replace all four at once for preventative maintenance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on if replacing one or all.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diverter Valve Failure**
