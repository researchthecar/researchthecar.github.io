The 2019 Volkswagen Golf Alltrack is a popular wagon known for its practicality, all-wheel-drive capability, and fun-to-drive nature. It comes standard with a 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 168 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed DSG automatic transmission.
