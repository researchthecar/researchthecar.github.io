**Introduction**

The 1997 Volkswagen Combi is a versatile and spacious vehicle known for its affordability and practicality. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L naturally aspirated gasoline engine producing 115 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.8L VR6 naturally aspirated gasoline engine producing 172 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual transmission and a 4-speed automatic transmission.
