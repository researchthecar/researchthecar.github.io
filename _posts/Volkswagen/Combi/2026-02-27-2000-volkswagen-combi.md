### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Volkswagen Combi is generally considered a reliable vehicle, particularly the diesel variants, though they are not immune to age-related issues. Common problems tend to revolve around the engine's head gasket and injector pump seals on diesel models, and clutch wear or automatic transmission issues on both manual and automatic versions. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also common wear items. Electrical gremlins, often due to aging wiring, can manifest as intermittent faults. Exterior rust is a significant concern for vehicles in corrosive environments. While repairs can be costly, especially for transmission or extensive bodywork, proactive maintenance and addressing issues promptly can ensure the longevity of these practical vehicles.
