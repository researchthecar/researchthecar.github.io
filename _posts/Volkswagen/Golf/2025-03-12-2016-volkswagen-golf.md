**Summary**

The 2016 Volkswagen Golf, while praised for its driving dynamics and practicality, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant issues revolve around the automatic transmission (mechatronic unit failure) and potential engine problems (turbocharger failure, DPF/EGR issues for the TDI engine). Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system, are also relatively common. The severity and cost of repairs can vary, but addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. It's recommended to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic, especially focusing on the transmission and engine, to identify any potential problems before making a purchase.
