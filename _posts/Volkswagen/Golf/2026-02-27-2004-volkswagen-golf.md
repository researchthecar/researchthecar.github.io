### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volkswagen Golf (Mk4) is a capable compact car, but its reliability can be inconsistent. Petrol engines, particularly the 1.6L and 2.0L, are prone to oil consumption and ignition issues. The 1.8T requires attention to its turbo and PCV system. Diesel 1.9 TDI engines are generally robust but can suffer from turbo and injector pump seal issues. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4-speed 01M, are a known weak point with torque converter and valve body problems. Manual transmissions are more reliable, though clutch wear is expected. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, are common. Suspension components like bushings can wear out. Rust can be an issue on older examples. Regular maintenance and addressing issues promptly are key to maintaining this generation of Golf.
