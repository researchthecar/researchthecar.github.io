### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Volkswagen Golf (Mk4) offers a generally competent ownership experience, but potential issues should be considered. The 1.8T engine is known for ignition coil and PCV problems, while the 1.9 TDI can suffer from turbocharger and EGR issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4-speed, are more prone to leaks and solenoid failures than their manual counterparts. Suspension components like control arm bushings and ball joints are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster faults, can also surface. Rust can be a concern on older models, especially in certain areas. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to emerging issues are crucial for maximizing the longevity and reliability of a 2002 Golf.
