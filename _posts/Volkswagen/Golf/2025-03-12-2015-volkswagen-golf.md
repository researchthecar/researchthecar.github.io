The 2015 Volkswagen Golf is a popular compact car known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and fun-to-drive nature. Engine options include a 1.8L TSI turbocharged four-cylinder producing 170 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L TDI diesel engine producing 150 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque (Dieselgate controversy aside), and a 2.0L TSI engine in the GTI producing 210 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, 6-speed automatic, and 6-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic depending on the engine. Owners generally appreciate the Golf's comfortable ride, spacious interior for its class, and refined driving experience. Common dislikes include relatively high maintenance costs compared to some competitors, some reported electrical issues, and the Dieselgate scandal which affected resale values of TDI models.

**Engine**

**1.8L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) Petrol Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 1.8L TSI engines, particularly in earlier production models, exhibited excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil between oil changes, blue exhaust smoke, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Replacement of piston rings, valve seals, or even the entire engine may be necessary, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+

**2.0L TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) Diesel Engine**

*   **Dieselgate Emissions Scandal Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.0L TDI engine was at the center of the Volkswagen Dieselgate emissions scandal, where it was revealed that the engine was equipped with defeat devices to cheat emissions tests. This led to reduced performance, lower fuel economy, and potential long-term reliability issues after the emissions fix was applied.
    *   Solution: Software updates were performed to bring the engine into compliance with emissions standards, but this could impact performance and fuel economy.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: (related to Dieselgate specifically) Covered by Volkswagen as part of settlements.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) Petrol Engine (GTI)**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Direct injection engines like the 2.0L TSI are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, which can cause rough idling, misfires, reduced performance, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Manual cleaning of the intake valves (walnut blasting) is the most common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2015 Volkswagen Golf, while a well-regarded vehicle, has some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption in the 1.8L TSI and carbon buildup in the GTI's 2.0L TSI can be costly to address. DSG transmission problems can also be a significant expense. Electrical and interior issues, while less severe, can still be frustrating. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should factor these into their purchase decision and budget for potential repairs. For TDI models, the Dieselgate scandal remains a factor, impacting long-term reliability and resale value.
