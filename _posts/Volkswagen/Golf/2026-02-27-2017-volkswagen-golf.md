### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volkswagen Golf generally offers good reliability, particularly with its manual transmissions and the smaller 1.4L TSI engine. The most common concerns tend to revolve around the DSG automatic transmissions, specifically potential issues with the mechatronic unit and clutch packs, which can be costly to repair. Engine-wise, the turbocharged TSI engines can experience issues like coolant leaks from the water pump/thermostat housing and PCV system problems. Carbon buildup is also a consideration for the higher-performance 2.0L turbo engines. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are not uncommon. While not a litany of major problems, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas, especially when considering a used model with higher mileage or a DSG transmission.
