The 2014 Volkswagen Eos is a hardtop convertible known for its unique design and comfortable ride. It was only offered with one engine option: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed DSG automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Eos for its open-air driving experience and relatively fuel-efficient engine. Common complaints often revolve around the complexity of the convertible top mechanism and potential maintenance costs associated with a European car.

The convertible top issues can range from sensor problems to hydraulic pump failures, leading to potentially high repair costs. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like the Mechatronic unit or convertible top repair, can be quite costly. Owners should be prepared for potential maintenance expenses associated with these specific areas of the vehicle.
