The 2016 Volkswagen Eos is a hardtop convertible known for its unique folding roof and comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine option: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. It comes with a 6-speed DSG transmission. People like the Eos for its open-air driving experience and relatively fuel-efficient engine. Common dislikes include the complexity of the folding roof mechanism, which can lead to issues, and limited rear passenger space.

**Engine**

**2.0L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) Engine**

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, long cranking times, rough idling, and potential fuel starvation leading to stalling. The car may throw a P0087 code (Fuel Rail/System Pressure - Too Low).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump, potentially with an updated revision to address design flaws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $900+
    *   Recalls: None Found
