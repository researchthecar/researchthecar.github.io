**Introduction**

The 2011 Volkswagen Eos is a compact hardtop convertible available with front-wheel drive. It comes standard with a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Other available engine options include a 3.6L V6, while transmission choices include a six-speed manual and a six-speed dual-clutch automatic (DSG) transmission.
