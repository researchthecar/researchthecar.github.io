The 2007 Volkswagen Eos is a hardtop convertible known for its sleek design and relatively affordable price point. Engine options for the 2007 model year include a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L VR6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox) automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Eos for its open-air driving experience and European styling. Common complaints revolve around the complexity of the convertible top mechanism and potential reliability issues.
