The convertible top is a complex system, and leaks or mechanism failures can be a significant concern. Electrical issues, while less severe, can still be inconvenient. Overall, while the Eos offers a unique driving experience, potential owners should factor in the potential for these repairs when considering purchasing one. The severity and cost of the issues vary, with engine and transmission problems potentially leading to the highest repair bills.
