The 2015 Volkswagen Eos is a hardtop convertible known for its stylish design and unique retractable roof. It came equipped with a single engine option: a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed dual-clutch DSG automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Eos for its open-air driving experience and relatively fuel-efficient engine. Criticisms often center on the car's age, dated technology, and potential for complex roof-related repairs.
