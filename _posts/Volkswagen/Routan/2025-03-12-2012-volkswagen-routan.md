The 2012 Volkswagen Routan is a minivan offering a blend of German engineering and American practicality. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Routan's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available features like rear entertainment systems. However, common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system and some engine components, as well as the perception that it is a rebadged Chrysler Town & Country/Dodge Grand Caravan with a higher price tag.
