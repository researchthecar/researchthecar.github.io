The 2011 Volkswagen Routan is a minivan offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior, appealing to families needing practicality. It's essentially a rebadged Chrysler Town & Country/Dodge Grand Caravan. The 2011 Routan was available with two engine options: a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L V6 producing 251 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Routan's European styling cues and comfortable seating, while others find the Chrysler-based platform less refined than some competitors and some have complained about reliability.
