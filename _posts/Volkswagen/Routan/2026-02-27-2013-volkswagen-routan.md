# 2013 Volkswagen Routan

### Overview
The 2013 Volkswagen Routan, a rebadged Chrysler Town & Country, shares much of its underlying architecture with its Mopar counterparts. This means its reliability profile is closely tied to the known strengths and weaknesses of the Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country models of the same era. While generally considered adequate for its class, certain areas have shown a propensity for issues that go beyond routine maintenance. Owners should be aware of potential concerns, particularly with the powertrain and some electrical components, though many of these issues are well-documented and have established repair procedures. The Routan offers a comfortable and spacious interior, making it a practical choice for families, but proactive maintenance and awareness of common problems are key to ensuring long-term satisfaction.

### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Volkswagen Routan presents a mixed reliability picture, largely mirroring its Chrysler/Dodge siblings. The 3.6L Pentastar engine is generally robust but can suffer from intake manifold and oil filter housing leaks. The 62TE automatic transmission is a common source of complaints, with harsh shifting and torque converter issues being notable. Suspension components like ball joints and control arms may require attention as mileage increases. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and power sliding door motors, are also reported. While the exterior and interior are generally free from major widespread defects, potential buyers should be aware of these common powertrain and electrical concerns and factor in potential repair costs.
