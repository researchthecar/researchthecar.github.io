The 2010 Volkswagen Routan is a minivan that was essentially a rebadged Dodge Grand Caravan/Chrysler Town & Country. It offered a more European-inspired styling and interior, hoping to appeal to a different demographic. Engine options included a 3.8-liter V6 producing 197 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0-liter V6 producing 253 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People liked the Routan for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and relatively affordable price point. Common dislikes included its uninspired driving dynamics, reliability issues, and the fact that it wasn't a "true" Volkswagen, as it was manufactured by Chrysler.
