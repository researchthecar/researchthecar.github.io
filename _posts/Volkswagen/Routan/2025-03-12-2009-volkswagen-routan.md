The 2009 Volkswagen Routan is a minivan that shares its platform with the Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan. The Routan offered a 3.8L V6 engine producing 197 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L V6 engine producing 251 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some people appreciate the Routan for its more European-tuned suspension and interior styling compared to its Chrysler counterparts. However, others dislike it for not offering the Stow 'n Go seating found in the Chrysler minivans and for potential reliability issues.
