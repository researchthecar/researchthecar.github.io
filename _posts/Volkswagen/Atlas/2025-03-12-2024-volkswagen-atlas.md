The 2024 Volkswagen Atlas is a mid-size SUV offering a spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. For 2024, it comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, producing 269 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. While owners often praise its ample cargo space and updated interior design, some common complaints revolve around electronic glitches and occasional build quality concerns.
