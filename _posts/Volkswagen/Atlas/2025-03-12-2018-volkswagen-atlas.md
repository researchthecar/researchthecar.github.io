The 2018 Volkswagen Atlas marked VW's entry into the mid-size SUV market, offering spacious seating for up to seven passengers and a comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 generating 276 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. The four-cylinder was paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 could be had with either front-wheel or all-wheel drive, also paired with the eight-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Atlas's ample interior space and user-friendly technology, but some have reported issues with electrical glitches and drivetrain components.
