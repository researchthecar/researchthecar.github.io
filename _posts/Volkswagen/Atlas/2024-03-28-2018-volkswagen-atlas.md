**Introduction to the 2018 Volkswagen Atlas**

The 2018 Volkswagen Atlas is a mid-size SUV that offers a spacious interior, powerful engine options, and a range of advanced features. It is available with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-four with 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L VR6 engine with 276 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include an eight-speed automatic transmission for both engines and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission for the 3.6L VR6.

The Atlas is praised for its roomy cabin, comfortable seats, and excellent fuel economy. However, it has faced some criticism for its lack of off-road capability and its somewhat underwhelming towing capacity.
