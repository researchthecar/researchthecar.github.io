The 2020 Volkswagen Atlas is a mid-size SUV that seats up to seven passengers. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 235 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 276 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Atlas for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. However, common complaints include subpar fuel economy (especially with the V6), some reliability concerns, and a somewhat uninspired driving experience.

**Summary**

The 2020 Volkswagen Atlas, while praised for its spaciousness and comfort, does have some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the V6 (coolant leaks and timing chain issues), can be costly to repair. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and backup camera are also prevalent. Transmission problems such as harsh shifting can be common, but can be addressed through software updates. While some issues are minor and easily fixed, others, like engine or transmission failures, can be quite expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
