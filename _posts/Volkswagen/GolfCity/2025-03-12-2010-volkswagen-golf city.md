The 2010 Volkswagen Golf City is a Canada-only model, essentially a rebadged version of the Mk4 Golf. It came with a single engine option, the 2.0L inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, and offered either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its affordability, fuel efficiency, and simple design. Common complaints often center on the dated interior, limited features compared to newer models, and some reliability issues associated with older VW models.

Engine issues such as coolant leaks, ignition coil, and oxygen sensor failures are common, though generally inexpensive to fix. Suspension components such as control arm bushings are prone to wear. Electrical problems can occur with power windows and the central locking system. Rust is a potential concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. Headliner sagging is a common interior issue.
