The 2009 Volkswagen Golf City is a Canadian market-specific model, a rebadged version of the fourth-generation Golf (Mk4). It was offered with a single engine option: a 2.0L inline-4 gasoline engine producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Golf City for its affordability, simple mechanicals, and decent fuel economy. Common complaints often involve the aging platform's reliability issues, dated styling, and basic feature set.
