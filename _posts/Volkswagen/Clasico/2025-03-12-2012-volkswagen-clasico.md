The 2012 Volkswagen Clasico, primarily sold in Mexico and other Latin American markets, is a sedan based on the Volkswagen Jetta Mk4 platform. It offers a reliable and affordable transportation option, but like any vehicle, it's prone to certain issues. The most common engine option is a 2.0-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 115 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic.
