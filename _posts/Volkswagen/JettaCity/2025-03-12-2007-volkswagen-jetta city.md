The 2007 Volkswagen Jetta City was a Canadian-market variant of the Jetta, essentially a rebadged version of the fourth-generation (Mk4) Jetta. It offered a simpler, more affordable alternative to the then-current Mk5 Jetta. The primary engine option was a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated its fuel efficiency, simple design, and lower price point compared to newer Jettas. Common complaints revolved around its dated styling, basic features, and some reliability concerns typical of older vehicles.
