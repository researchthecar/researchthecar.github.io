### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volkswagen Jetta City presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.0L TDI engine is prone to turbocharger and EGR valve issues, while the 1.6L MPI appears more robust. Automatic transmissions, specifically the 09G, can experience torque converter problems and fluid leaks. Manual transmissions are generally more reliable, though clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are typical wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and alternators, are also reported. Interior components like HVAC blower motors and door lock actuators can fail. Overall, while offering good value, potential owners should be aware of these common issues, particularly concerning the diesel engine and automatic transmission, and budget for potential repairs.
