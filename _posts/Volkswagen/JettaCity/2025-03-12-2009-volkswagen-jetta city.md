The 2009 Volkswagen Jetta City is a value-oriented sedan offering a blend of German engineering and affordability. It was available with a single engine option: a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 115 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Jetta City's fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and relatively comfortable ride. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated styling, basic features, and potential for certain reliability issues.
