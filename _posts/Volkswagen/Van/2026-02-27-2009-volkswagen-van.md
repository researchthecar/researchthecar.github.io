### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volkswagen Van, particularly its diesel variants, can be a reliable workhorse if well-maintained. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, specifically turbocharger and EGR valve problems in the TDI engines, and injector issues in larger diesel displacements. Automatic transmission torque converters and fluid leaks are also noted concerns. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are subject to wear, as are electrical parts such as alternators. Exterior rust can be a factor on older models. While not immune to problems, addressing these potential issues proactively can ensure the continued serviceability of the vehicle.
