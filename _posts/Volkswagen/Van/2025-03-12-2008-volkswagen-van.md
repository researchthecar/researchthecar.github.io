The 2008 Volkswagen Routan is a minivan that was a rebadged Chrysler Town & Country/Dodge Grand Caravan. It was offered with two engine options: a 3.8L V6 producing 197 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L V6 producing 251 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Routan's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available features.
