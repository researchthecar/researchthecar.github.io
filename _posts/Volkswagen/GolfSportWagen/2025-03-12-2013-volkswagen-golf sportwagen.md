The 2013 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen offers a blend of practicality and driving fun, making it a popular choice for those needing extra cargo space without sacrificing the nimble handling of a Golf. Engine options include a 2.5-liter inline-5 gasoline engine producing 170 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine producing 140 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices are a 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic for the gasoline engine, and a 6-speed manual or 6-speed DSG (dual-clutch) automatic for the diesel. Owners appreciate the SportWagen's fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and comfortable ride, but some common complaints include electrical issues and premature wear of certain components.
