The 2015 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen is a versatile compact wagon praised for its fuel efficiency, practicality, and fun-to-drive nature.

The gasoline engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel engine was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (DSG) transmission.
