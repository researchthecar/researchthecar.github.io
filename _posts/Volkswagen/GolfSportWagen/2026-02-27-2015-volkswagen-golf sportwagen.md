### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen is a reliable vehicle, particularly with the gasoline engine. The 1.8L TSI engine is generally robust, though coolant leaks and PCV issues can arise. The 2.0L TDI diesel engine, while offering excellent fuel economy, is more prone to issues related to its emissions system, specifically the DPF and EGR valve, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmission is typically trouble-free. The DSG automatic, however, has been known to experience mechatronic unit failures and clutch wear. Electrical gremlins are not uncommon, with infotainment system glitches and power window issues being the most frequently reported. Overall, the SportWagen provides good value, but potential buyers of the diesel models should be aware of the higher potential repair costs associated with the emissions system.
