The 2016 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen is a popular choice for those seeking a versatile and fuel-efficient vehicle with a sporty driving feel. It was available with a 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine producing 170 horsepower and 199 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine producing 150 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque.
