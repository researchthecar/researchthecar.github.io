The 2016 Volkswagen Transporter T6 is a popular van known for its practicality, spaciousness, and comfortable ride. Engine options for this model year included various 2.0-liter TDI diesel engines with power outputs ranging from 84 PS (62 kW) to 204 PS (150 kW), and 2.0-liter TSI gasoline engines with power outputs of 150 PS (110 kW) and 204 PS (150 kW). Depending on the engine, the Transporter could be equipped with a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, or a 7-speed DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox) automatic transmission. Owners often praise its versatility for both commercial and personal use, while some find its price point and occasional reliability concerns to be drawbacks.

The 2016 Volkswagen Transporter T6 is a versatile van, but owners may encounter issues related to the EGR valve or DPF, particularly in the diesel models. The DSG transmission can also be a source of concern due to potential Mechatronic unit or clutch failures. Other common problems include suspension bushing wear and electrical system malfunctions. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more costly, particularly those involving the transmission or DPF.
