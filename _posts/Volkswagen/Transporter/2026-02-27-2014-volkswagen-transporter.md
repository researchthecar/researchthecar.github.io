### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Volkswagen Transporter is a generally reliable workhorse, with most reported issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic design flaws. The TDI engines, while powerful, can be susceptible to EGR and turbocharger issues, particularly with high mileage or inconsistent maintenance. The DSG automatic transmission, though offering convenience, has a known potential for mechatronic unit problems. Suspension components like bushings can wear over time, especially under heavy use. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and battery drain, are also noted but often repairable. Overall, with regular maintenance and attention to these specific potential problem areas, the Transporter should provide dependable service.
