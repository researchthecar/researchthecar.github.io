The 2022 Volkswagen Transporter, also known as the T6.1, is a popular van known for its versatility and practicality. Engine options typically include a range of 2.0-liter TDI diesel engines with varying power outputs. For example, a common option is the 2.0-liter TDI producing around 148 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. A petrol option is also available, the 2.0-liter TSI. Transmission options include a manual gearbox and a DSG automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Transporter's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong resale value. However, some common complaints include the relatively high price compared to competitors, potential issues with the infotainment system, and concerns about the long-term reliability of certain components.
