### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Volkswagen Transporter is a robust commercial vehicle with a generally good reliability record. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the diesel engines, particularly the EGR valve and DPF systems on the 2.0L TDI variants, and potential turbocharger issues on higher-output models. Transmission reliability is decent, though manual clutches can wear, and the DSG automatic's mechatronic unit can be a significant expense if it fails. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are common wear items. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and alternator problems, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, with diligent maintenance and attention to these specific potential issues, the Transporter can remain a dependable workhorse.
