### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Volkswagen Transporter is a generally reliable workhorse, with most reported issues stemming from its diesel engine's emissions control systems (DPF, EGR) and potential wear on automatic transmission components like the mechatronic unit and dual clutches. Manual transmissions are more straightforward but can experience clutch wear. Suspension components and some electrical gremlins, such as battery drain or sensor failures, are also noted. Exterior rust, particularly on lower body panels, and interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure or infotainment glitches can occur. Proactive maintenance and addressing early warning signs are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
