The 2019 Volkswagen Transporter T6.1 is a popular van known for its practicality, spaciousness, and versatility. Engine options typically include a range of 2.0-liter TDI diesel engines with varying power outputs, from around 84 horsepower to 199 horsepower, and a 2.0-liter TSI petrol engine with up to 204 horsepower. Torque figures vary depending on the engine, but the TDI engines generally offer good low-end torque. Some owners appreciate the Transporter's comfortable ride and car-like handling, while others find the infotainment system dated and the price relatively high compared to competitors. Common complaints often involve reliability issues, particularly with certain engine components and electrical systems. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 7-speed DSG (Direct Shift Gearbox) automatic.

**Summary**

The 2019 Volkswagen Transporter T6.1, while practical and versatile, appears to have some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the EGR valve, DPF, and turbochargers on the diesel engines, can lead to significant repair costs. The 7-speed DSG transmission also seems prone to mechatronic unit failures and clutch wear. Electrical issues with the infotainment system, central locking, and sensors are also noteworthy. Interior rattles and sliding door issues round out the list. While some of these problems may be minor annoyances, others can be quite costly to repair, potentially making reliability a concern for some owners.
