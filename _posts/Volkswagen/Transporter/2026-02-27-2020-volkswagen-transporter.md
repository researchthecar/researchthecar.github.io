These issues are generally repairable with moderate costs. The various 2.0L TDI engine options and transmission choices (manual and DSG automatic) have not shown significant widespread reliability concerns. With diligent maintenance and addressing minor electrical or mechanical quirks promptly, the Transporter remains a dependable workhorse.
