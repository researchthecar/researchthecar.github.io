### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Volkswagen Transporter is a generally reliable workhorse, with most reported issues stemming from its powertrain, particularly the diesel engines and automatic transmissions. Common concerns include turbocharger and EGR valve problems in the 2.0L TDI, injector issues in the 2.5L TDI, and potential mechatronic unit failures in the DSG automatic. Manual transmissions can experience clutch wear and bearing issues. Suspension components like shock absorbers and bushings are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, can occur. However, the exterior and interior generally hold up well. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of these common issues can significantly prolong the vehicle's service life.
