The 2015 Volkswagen Transporter T5 (also known as the Caravelle, Multivan, or California depending on the market and trim) is a popular van known for its versatility and spaciousness. Engine options included a range of 2.0-liter TDI diesel engines with varying power outputs, as well as petrol options. A common diesel choice is the 2.0-liter TDI producing around 140 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the Transporter's practicality, comfortable ride, and solid build quality. However, some common complaints include issues with the EGR valve, dual mass flywheel failures, and electrical gremlins.
