### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Volkswagen Transporter is a generally reliable workhorse, with its diesel engines and manual transmissions being particularly robust. Common issues tend to be related to emissions systems (DPF, EGR), turbochargers on higher-output engines, and wear on suspension components and clutch systems over time. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain or sensor failures, can occur but are not overwhelmingly prevalent. Rust can be a concern on older models, especially in corrosive climates. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing specific known issues, the Transporter can continue to provide dependable service.
