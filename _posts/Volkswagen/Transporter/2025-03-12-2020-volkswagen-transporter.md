The 2020 Volkswagen Transporter, also known as the T6.1, is a popular van known for its practicality, versatility, and comfortable ride. Engine options for the 2020 Transporter include various 2.0-liter TDI diesel engines with power outputs ranging from 90 to 199 horsepower and a 2.0-liter TSI petrol engine. Transmission options primarily consist of a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, or a 7-speed DSG automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Transporter for its spacious interior, refined driving experience, and strong residual values. However, some common complaints include the relatively high price, potential for electronic glitches, and occasional issues with the DSG transmission.
