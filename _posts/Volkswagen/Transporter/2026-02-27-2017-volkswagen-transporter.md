### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volkswagen Transporter demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its engine and exterior/interior components, with no widespread critical failures reported. The most common concerns tend to be related to the EGR valve and turbocharger on the 2.0L TDI engines, and clutch wear or DSG transmission issues, especially the mechatronics unit. Suspension components like shock absorbers can also wear over time. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain or sensor failures, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and mileage. Proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly can significantly extend the lifespan and maintain the dependability of the Transporter.
