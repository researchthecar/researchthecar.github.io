The 2021 Volkswagen Taos marked the introduction of a new compact SUV to the Volkswagen lineup, positioned below the Tiguan. It is generally well-received for its spacious interior relative to its exterior size, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. However, some common complaints revolve around the responsiveness of the transmission, particularly at low speeds, and the sometimes laggy infotainment system. The Taos comes standard with a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Front-wheel-drive models are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive versions get a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.
