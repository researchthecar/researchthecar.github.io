### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Volkswagen CC presents a generally acceptable reliability profile for its class, but potential buyers should be aware of specific common issues. The 2.0L turbo engine can be prone to PCV valve and ignition coil problems, while the VR6 may encounter timing chain wear. Automatic transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and mechatronic unit, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, and electrical gremlins such as window regulators and infotainment glitches are not uncommon. Interior comfort features like blend door actuators can also fail. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential costs and ensuring a more reliable ownership experience.
