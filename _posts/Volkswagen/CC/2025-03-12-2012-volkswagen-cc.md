The 2012 Volkswagen CC is a stylish four-door coupe that aimed to blend sporty design with practicality. Engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.6L VR6. The 2.0L TSI engine produced approximately 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options for the 2.0L TSI included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic. The 3.6L VR6 engine produced approximately 280 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque and was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the CC for its sleek styling and comfortable ride, but common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly electrical problems and premature wear of certain components. Some owners found the back seats to be cramped and the maintenance costs to be higher than average.
