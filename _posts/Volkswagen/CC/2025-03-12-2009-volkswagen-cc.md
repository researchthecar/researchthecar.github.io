The 2009 Volkswagen CC (Comfort Coupe) aimed to blend the sleek styling of a coupe with the practicality of a sedan. Engine options included a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.6L VR6. The 2.0L produced around 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. The VR6 produced around 280 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque and was typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the CC for its stylish design and relatively upscale interior for its price point. Common complaints centered around reliability issues and the higher cost of maintenance compared to some competitors.
