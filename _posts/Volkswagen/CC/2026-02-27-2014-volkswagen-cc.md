### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Volkswagen CC presents a generally reliable package, particularly for models equipped with the VR6 engine and the standard automatic transmission. The 2.0L TSI engine and DSG transmission are more prone to specific, albeit repairable, issues such as PCV valve failures, water pump leaks, and mechatronic unit problems. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, can also occur. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of potential costs associated with these specific components, especially the DSG transmission. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
