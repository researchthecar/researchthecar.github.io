### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volkswagen CC presents a generally reliable profile, particularly with its V6 engine option. The more common 2.0L TSI engine can experience issues with the PCV valve and water pump, which are moderately costly to repair. The DSG transmission, while offering performance benefits, has documented potential failures with its mechatronics unit and clutch packs, representing a significant repair expense. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and power window issues, are also noted but are typically less severe. Overall, the CC is a stylish choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific transmission and engine component vulnerabilities, especially concerning the DSG gearbox.
