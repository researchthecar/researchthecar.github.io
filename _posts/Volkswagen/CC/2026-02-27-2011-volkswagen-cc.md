### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Volkswagen CC offers a compelling blend of style and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with the 2.0L TSI engine and the DSG automatic transmission. Issues like PCV valve failure, timing chain problems, and mechatronic unit failures in the DSG can lead to significant repair costs. The VR6 engine and manual transmission appear to be more robust. While the suspension, exterior, and interior are generally reliable, electrical gremlins such as clogged sunroof drains and infotainment glitches can occur. Careful inspection and maintenance history review are recommended.
