### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Volkswagen CC generally presents a good reliability record, especially when considering its premium positioning. The 2.0L turbocharged engine is more commonly associated with minor issues like PCV valve failures and occasional turbocharger concerns, while the VR6 can experience timing chain wear. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 6-speed variants, have seen reports of slipping and mechatronic unit issues, which can be costly to repair. Manual transmissions are typically more robust. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are relatively free of widespread, significant problems, with isolated incidents like window regulators or infotainment glitches being the most common. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
