The 2.0L TSI engine can experience PCV valve issues and carbon buildup, while the 3.6L VR6 may face timing chain wear and intake manifold flap problems. The DSG transmission, while offering quick shifts, is more prone to mechatronic unit and clutch pack issues than the manual.

Despite these points, many issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, allowing the CC to remain a stylish and enjoyable vehicle.
