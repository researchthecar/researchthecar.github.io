### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volkswagen CC presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core mechanical components are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the DSG transmission's mechatronics unit and clutch packs, and the 3.6L VR6 engine's timing chain. The 2.0L turbo engine has common, though often manageable, issues like PCV valve failure and carbon buildup. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and power window regulators, are also noted. Proactive maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission and addressing early signs of engine issues, can significantly mitigate these potential problems and contribute to a more reliable ownership experience.
