The 2013 Volkswagen CC is a stylish four-door coupe that aimed to blend luxury with practicality. The standard engine was a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 cylinder producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. An optional 3.6L VR6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque was also available. The 2.0L was offered with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed DSG automatic transmission, while the VR6 came exclusively with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praised the CC's sleek design, comfortable ride, and relatively fuel-efficient engine. However, common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system and the DSG transmission (if equipped).

**Engine**

**2.0L TSI (Turbocharged Stratified Injection) Inline-4**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon cold start, especially prevalent in earlier TSI engines. If left unaddressed, the chain can skip, causing severe engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, guides, and potentially related components. Upgraded tensioner design is available to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Runner Flap Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced performance, rough idle. The plastic intake manifold runner flaps can break, causing vacuum leaks and poor engine operation.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L VR6**

*   **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, decreased fuel economy, reduced performance. Direct injection engines are prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves as there is no fuel washing the valves during normal engine operation.
    *   Solution: Manually clean the carbon deposits from the intake valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Volkswagen CC offers a stylish and comfortable driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of several common issues. Engine problems, particularly timing chain issues on the 2.0L TSI, and carbon buildup on the 3.6L VR6 can be costly to repair. The DSG transmission (on 2.0L models) is prone to mechatronic unit and clutch pack failures, also leading to significant expenses. Electrical and suspension issues are also common. While some issues may be minor, others can be quite severe and expensive to fix, so a thorough inspection and service history review are highly recommended before purchasing a used 2013 VW CC.
