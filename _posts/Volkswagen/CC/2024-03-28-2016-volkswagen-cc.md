## 2016 Volkswagen CC

The 2016 Volkswagen CC is a four-door coupe that offers a refined and sporty driving experience. It comes with a choice of two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 engine that produces 292 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The CC has received praise for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and responsive handling. However, it has also been criticized for its limited rear-seat space and high price tag.
