The 2022 Volkswagen Volksbus is a popular choice for commercial and public transportation, known for its spacious interior, reliability, and versatility. While specific engine and transmission options can vary depending on the market and configuration, common choices often include diesel engines, providing a balance of power and fuel efficiency. These diesel engines typically range from around 150 to 250 horsepower and produce corresponding torque figures suitable for hauling passengers and cargo. Owners appreciate the Volksbus for its comfortable ride, large passenger capacity, and relatively low operating costs. However, some common complaints revolve around the vehicle's turning radius, which can be challenging in tight urban environments, and the somewhat basic interior features compared to more modern passenger vehicles.
