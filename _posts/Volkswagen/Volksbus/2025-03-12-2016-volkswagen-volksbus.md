The 2016 Volkswagen Volksbus is a popular choice for commercial and passenger transport in many regions. It's known for its spaciousness, reliability, and versatility. While specific engine and transmission options can vary significantly based on the market where it was sold, a common diesel engine found in these buses is the 2.0L TDI engine, which produces around 140 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. This engine is often paired with a manual or automated manual transmission. Owners often praise the vehicle's cargo capacity and practicality but sometimes express concerns about fuel economy and maintenance costs, particularly in regions with challenging road conditions.
