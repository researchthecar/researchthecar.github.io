The 2017 Volkswagen Volksbus is a popular chassis used for building various commercial vehicles, including shuttle buses, school buses, and recreational vehicles, primarily used in Latin America. It is known for its robust build and adaptability. While not directly comparable to passenger vehicles, understanding common issues is crucial for potential buyers of upfitted vehicles based on this chassis. A common engine option for this chassis is the MAN D0836 diesel engine, producing around 280 horsepower and significant torque. Users appreciate its reliability and suitability for heavy-duty applications, but some find the ride quality and noise levels typical of commercial vehicles less desirable. Other engine and transmission options may be available based on region and upfitter specifications.
