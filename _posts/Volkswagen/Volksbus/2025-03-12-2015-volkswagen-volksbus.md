**Summary**

The 2015 Volkswagen Volksbus, while generally reliable for commercial use, is prone to certain recurring issues. The most common problems are related to the engine (particularly the EGR valve and DPF on diesel models) and the transmission (clutch and synchro wear). Suspension and electrical issues also surface frequently. The cost of repairs can vary, with some repairs being relatively inexpensive, while others (like transmission rebuilds) can be quite costly. Potential buyers should have a mechanic inspect the vehicle, particularly the EGR, DPF, clutch, and suspension, before purchase.
