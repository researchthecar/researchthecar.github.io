**Introduction:**

The 1994 Volkswagen Corrado is a sporty coupe known for its handling and performance. It was available with two engine options: a 2.0L 16-valve inline-four and a 2.8L VR6. The 2.0L engine produced 134 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.8L VR6 generated 178 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Corrado was praised for its nimble handling, comfortable interior, and stylish exterior, but it was also criticized for its high price and limited rear seat space.

**Engine**

**2.0L 16-valve inline-four**
- **Intake camshaft failure:** The intake camshaft can fail due to a manufacturing defect, causing the engine to stall or run poorly. Symptoms include loss of power, rough idling, and engine knocking. The solution is to replace the camshaft, which costs around $400 - $600.
- **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt can fail due to wear or tear, causing the engine to lose power or stall. Symptoms include a loss of power, a rattling noise from the engine, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the timing belt, which costs around $200 - $400.
- **Oil leak from valve cover gasket:** The valve cover gasket can fail and cause oil to leak from the engine. Symptoms include a visible oil leak on the top of the engine and low oil levels. The solution is to replace the valve cover gasket, which costs around $100 - $200.

**2.8L VR6**
- **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail and cause coolant and oil to leak from the engine. Symptoms include a visible leak from the front of the engine and low coolant or oil levels. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket, which costs around $300 - $500.
- **Water pump failure:** The water pump can fail and cause the engine to overheat. Symptoms include a loss of coolant, a squealing noise from the engine, and an illuminated temperature gauge. The solution is to replace the water pump, which costs around $200 - $400.

**Transmission**

**5-speed manual transmission**
- **First gear grind:** The first gear synchronizer can fail and cause the transmission to grind when shifting into first gear. Symptoms include a grinding noise when shifting into first gear. The solution is to replace the synchronizer, which costs around $200 - $400.
- **Reverse gear failure:** Reverse gear can fail due to a manufacturing defect. Symptoms include an inability to engage reverse gear. The solution is to replace the transmission, which costs around $1,500 - $2,500.

**4-speed automatic transmission**
- **Slipping transmission:** The transmission can slip when shifting gears due to worn clutch plates. Symptoms include a loss of power during acceleration and an illuminated check engine light. The solution is to replace the clutch plates, which costs around $500 - $700.
- **Transmission fluid leak:** The transmission fluid pan gasket can fail and cause transmission fluid to leak from the transmission. Symptoms include a visible leak under the vehicle and low transmission fluid levels. The solution is to replace the transmission fluid pan gasket, which costs around $100 - $200.

**Suspension**

- **Strut mount failure:** The strut mount can fail and cause the suspension to make a clunking noise. Symptoms include a clunking noise when driving over bumps and decreased handling performance. The solution is to replace the strut mount, which costs around $200 - $400 for both the front and rear.

**Electrical**

- **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail and cause the battery to discharge. Symptoms include a loss of electrical power, a flickering dashboard, and an illuminated check engine light. The solution is to replace the alternator, which costs around $300 - $500.
- **Starter failure:** The starter can fail and prevent the engine from starting. Symptoms include a clicking noise when turning the key and an inability to start the engine. The solution is to replace the starter, which costs around $200 - $400.

**Exterior**

- **Tail light failure:** The tail lights can fail due to a faulty electrical connection. Symptoms include one or both tail lights not working. The solution is to check the electrical connection and replace the tail light if necessary, which costs around $100 - $200.
- **Window motor failure:** The window motor can fail and prevent the window from operating. Symptoms include the window not rolling up or down. The solution is to replace the window motor, which costs around $200 - $400.

**Interior**

- **Dashboard crack:** The dashboard can crack due to exposure to sunlight. Symptoms include a visible crack on the dashboard. The solution is to replace the dashboard, which costs around $400 - $600.
- **AC system failure:** The AC system can fail due to a compressor failure or a refrigerant leak. Symptoms include a lack of cold air from the AC vents. The solution is to replace the compressor or repair the leak, which costs around $500 - $1,000.

**Recalls:**

- NHTSA Campaign Number: 95V105000: Seat Belts - Front:Anchor Assembly
- NHTSA Campaign Number: 94V080001: Seat Belts - Front:Retractor Assembly

**Summary:**

The Volkswagen Corrado is a reliable and enjoyable car, but it is not without its issues. The most serious issues are the intake camshaft failure and the reverse gear failure, which can be costly to repair. The transmission and electrical system also have some common issues, but the repairs are typically less expensive. Overall, the cost of maintenance and repairs for the Corrado is moderate.
