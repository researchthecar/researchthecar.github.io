The 2012 Volkswagen Gol Sedan is a subcompact car popular in South America, particularly Brazil. It's known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and relatively spacious interior for its class. The 2012 model typically came with a 1.0L or 1.6L inline-4 gasoline engine. The 1.6L engine typically produced around 101-104 horsepower and around 105 lb-ft of torque, depending on the fuel used (gasoline or ethanol). Owners often appreciate its practicality and ease of parking in urban environments. Common complaints include basic interior materials, relatively low power output, and limited availability of advanced features compared to newer cars.

**Engine**
