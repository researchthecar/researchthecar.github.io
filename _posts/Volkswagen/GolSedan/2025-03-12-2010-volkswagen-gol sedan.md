The 2010 Volkswagen Gol Sedan is a subcompact car popular in South America and other emerging markets. Engine options for the 2010 model typically included a 1.0L inline-4 petrol engine producing around 76 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L inline-4 petrol engine producing around 101 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque. These engines were generally paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Gol's affordability, fuel efficiency, and compact size, making it suitable for urban environments. Common complaints include basic interior features, limited sound dampening, and relatively low power output, especially with the 1.0L engine.
