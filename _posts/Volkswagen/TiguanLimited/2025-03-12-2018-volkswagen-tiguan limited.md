The 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan Limited is a compact SUV offering a blend of practicality and Volkswagen's signature driving experience. The "Limited" trim was a carryover model of the previous generation Tiguan while the redesigned longer wheelbase Tiguan was also sold as a 2018 model. The 2018 Tiguan Limited came standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate its relatively nimble handling and compact size, making it easy to maneuver in urban environments. However, some criticisms include the slightly dated interior compared to newer competitors and the fuel economy could be better.

**Summary**

The 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan Limited can be a reliable vehicle, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. Engine issues like timing chain tensioner and turbocharger failures can be severe and costly. Transmission problems, especially with the valve body, also present a significant repair expense. Other issues like suspension components, electrical glitches, and infotainment problems are less common but still worth considering. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify potential problems early. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, so budgeting for potential maintenance is wise.
