The 2018 Volkswagen Delivery is a popular light commercial vehicle, primarily sold in South America. The Delivery comes in several configurations regarding payload capacity and wheelbase. It offers versatility for urban delivery and logistics. While specific horsepower and torque figures vary depending on the sub-model (8.150, 9.170, 11.180), the engine options generally offer a balance of power and fuel efficiency suitable for commercial use. Owners often appreciate its maneuverability in city environments, robust build quality, and relatively comfortable cabin.
