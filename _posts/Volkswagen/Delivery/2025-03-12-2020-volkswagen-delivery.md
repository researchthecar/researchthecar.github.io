The 2020 Volkswagen Delivery is a light commercial vehicle primarily sold in South America. It comes in various configurations designed for urban delivery and short-haul transport. Engine options typically include diesel engines, and one common engine is a 2.8-liter diesel engine producing around 150 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, paired with a manual transmission. Owners appreciate the Delivery for its maneuverability in tight spaces and its functional design, while some common dislikes include relatively basic interior features and ride quality compared to passenger vehicles.
