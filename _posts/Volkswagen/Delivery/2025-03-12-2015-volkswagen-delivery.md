**Summary**

The 2015 Volkswagen Delivery, while a capable commercial vehicle, exhibits several common issues that owners may encounter. Engine problems, especially with turbocharger and EGR valve failures in the Cummins ISF 2.8L and fuel injector failure in the MWM International NGD 3.0E, can be relatively expensive to repair. Transmission difficulties, especially with the 5-speed manual, may require clutch and synchro replacements. Suspension issues, such as leaf spring problems, affect ride quality and load-carrying capacity. Electrical glitches and interior wear, while less critical, can also impact overall ownership experience. Rust is also a common issue. Addressing these potential problems proactively can minimize downtime and keep the vehicle operating efficiently.
