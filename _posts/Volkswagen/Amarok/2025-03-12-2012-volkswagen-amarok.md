The 2012 Volkswagen Amarok is a mid-size pickup truck known for its ruggedness and practicality. In 2012, the Amarok was primarily offered with a 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine in varying states of tune, typically producing around 120-177 horsepower and 221-295 lb-ft of torque, depending on the configuration. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a less common 8-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Amarok's comfortable ride for a pickup, its off-road capabilities, and its practical bed size. Common dislikes include its smaller engine displacement compared to some competitors and potential reliability concerns.
