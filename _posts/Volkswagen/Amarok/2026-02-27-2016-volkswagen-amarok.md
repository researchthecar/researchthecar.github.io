### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Volkswagen Amarok demonstrates a strong overall reliability, particularly with its V6 TDI engine and manual transmission options, which appear to be largely trouble-free. The more common issues tend to arise with the 2.0L Bi-Turbo diesel engine, specifically concerning the turbocharger and EGR valve, and to a lesser extent, potential leaks in the 8-speed automatic transmission. Suspension components, like leaf springs, can also be a point of concern under heavy use. Electrical sensor failures are not uncommon but are generally straightforward to address. Despite these points, the Amarok remains a dependable choice for those needing a capable and durable utility vehicle, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of systemic design flaws.
