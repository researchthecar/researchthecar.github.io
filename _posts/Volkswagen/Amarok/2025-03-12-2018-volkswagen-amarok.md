The 2018 Volkswagen Amarok is a mid-size pickup truck known for its car-like handling, comfortable interior, and robust build quality. The Amarok offers several engine options, including a 2.0-liter TDI four-cylinder diesel engine available in various power outputs, as well as a 3.0-liter TDI V6 diesel engine. Transmission options typically include a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic. The 3.0L TDI V6, for example, can produce around 221 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Amarok's refined driving experience and powerful diesel engines, while some common criticisms include its higher price point compared to competitors and the lack of a gasoline engine option.
