The 2013 Volkswagen Amarok is a mid-size pickup truck known for its ruggedness, practicality, and car-like driving experience. Available engine options for the 2013 model year included a 2.0-liter TDI diesel engine in various states of tune, as well as a 2.0-liter TSI gasoline engine in some markets. The 2.0-liter TDI produced 140-180 horsepower, depending on the configuration. Transmission choices include a 6-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Amarok's comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and off-road capabilities, but some dislike its relatively high price compared to competitors and occasional issues with reliability.
