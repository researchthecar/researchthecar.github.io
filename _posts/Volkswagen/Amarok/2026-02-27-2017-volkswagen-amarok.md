### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Volkswagen Amarok demonstrates good overall reliability, with its diesel engines and robust chassis being strong points. The most frequently cited technical concerns revolve around the 2.0L TDI engines, specifically turbocharger and EGR valve issues, which are not uncommon for turbocharged diesel engines of this era. The 7-speed DSG automatic transmission has also seen some reports of mechatronic unit and clutch pack issues. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and occasional battery drain, are present but not pervasive. The 3.0L V6 TDI and the manual transmission appear to be particularly reliable. For owners, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of the mentioned issues can help ensure long-term dependability.
