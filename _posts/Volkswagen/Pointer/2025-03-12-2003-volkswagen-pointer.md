The 2003 Volkswagen Pointer is a subcompact car primarily sold in Latin America. It was offered with a few engine options, most commonly a 1.8L inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 98 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. Other less common engine options included a 1.0L and 1.6L gasoline engine. A 5-speed manual transmission was the main transmission option. Owners generally appreciate the Pointer for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and relatively simple mechanical design, making it easy and cheap to maintain.
