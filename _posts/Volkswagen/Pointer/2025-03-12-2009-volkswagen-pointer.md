The 2009 Volkswagen Pointer is a subcompact car primarily sold in Latin America. The Pointer was offered with a few engine options, with the most common being a 1.8L inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 100 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. Some versions might have included a 1.6L engine as well. It was generally appreciated for its affordability and fuel efficiency but criticized for its basic features and somewhat dated design.
