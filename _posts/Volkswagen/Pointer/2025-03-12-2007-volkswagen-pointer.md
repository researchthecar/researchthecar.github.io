The 2007 Volkswagen Pointer is a subcompact car primarily sold in Latin American markets. It was offered with a few different engine options, including a 1.8L inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 100 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. A 1.6L engine was also available. The available transmissions were a 5-speed manual and an automated manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Pointer for its affordability and fuel efficiency, but common complaints revolve around build quality, reliability, and limited safety features.

**Summary**

The 2007 Volkswagen Pointer is a budget-friendly car, but it is prone to a number of issues. Engine problems such as excessive oil consumption and coolant leaks can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical issues are also common. Rust is a concern, particularly in regions with harsh weather conditions. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can be costly, potentially exceeding the vehicle's value. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common issues before making a purchase.
