While the Jetta is praised for its handling, spacious interior, and comfort, it has also been reported to have a few common issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Engine**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to jump or break, resulting in catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner and timing chain. Estimated cost to fix: $800 - $1,200+
* **Carbon Buildup on Intake Valves:** Over time, carbon can accumulate on the intake valves, reducing airflow and causing rough idling, misfires, and decreased power. The solution is to have the intake valves cleaned. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+

**1.8L Turbocharged Inline-4 Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail, causing a loss of power or complete engine failure. Symptoms include a whistling or whining noise from the engine, blue or black smoke from the exhaust, and decreased acceleration. The solution is to replace the turbocharger. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
