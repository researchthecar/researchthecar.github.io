### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Volkswagen Sedan offers a range of engine and transmission choices, each with its own reliability profile. The naturally aspirated gasoline engines are generally more robust than the turbocharged variants, which can be prone to turbocharger and PCV issues. The TDI diesel engine is known for its longevity but can suffer from glow plug and turbo actuator problems. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 01M, are a known weak point and can be costly to repair. Manual transmissions are more reliable but clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators, instrument clusters, and ABS modules, are also reported. Overall, while not without its flaws, the 2003 Volkswagen Sedan can be a dependable vehicle if common issues are addressed proactively and maintenance is kept up-to-date, especially concerning the transmission and electrical systems.
