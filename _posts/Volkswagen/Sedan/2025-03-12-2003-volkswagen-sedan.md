The 2003 Volkswagen Jetta is a compact sedan known for its German engineering, comfortable ride, and available TDI diesel engine. The 2003 Jetta was offered with a few engine options: a 2.0L inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 producing 180 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.9L TDI diesel inline-4 producing 90 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic (primarily paired with the 2.0L), and a 5-speed automatic (with Tiptronic, generally paired with the 1.8T and TDI). Owners often praise the Jetta's fuel efficiency (especially the TDI), solid feel, and available features. Common complaints include electrical issues, some reliability concerns, and relatively small back seats.

**Summary**

The 2003 Volkswagen Jetta, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, suffers from a range of common issues. Engine problems vary depending on the engine chosen, with the 2.0L and 1.8T engines experiencing different types of leaks and the TDI being susceptible to MAF and EGR issues. Transmission issues are especially common with the automatic transmissions, while suspension and electrical problems are also prevalent across the model year. Rust can also be a significant issue in certain climates. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to more significant expenses, particularly with turbocharger or transmission repairs. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems when considering a 2003 Jetta.
