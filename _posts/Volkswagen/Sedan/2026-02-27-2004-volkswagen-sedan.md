### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Volkswagen Sedan offers a competent driving experience but is not without its potential reliability concerns. The naturally aspirated 2.0L engine is generally robust, while the 1.8T variant can be prone to PCV and turbo issues if not maintained. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 01M, have a history of torque converter and valve body problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and blower motor resistors, also appear. While not a maintenance-free vehicle, addressing these known issues proactively can contribute to a more reliable ownership experience.
