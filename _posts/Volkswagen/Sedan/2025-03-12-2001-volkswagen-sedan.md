The 2001 Volkswagen Jetta (Sedan) is a compact car known for its German engineering, solid build quality, and engaging driving experience. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 115 horsepower and 122 lb-ft of torque, a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 making 150 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.9L TDI diesel engine outputting 90 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (primarily paired with the 2.0L engine) or a 5-speed automatic (primarily paired with the 1.8T and TDI engines). Owners often appreciate the Jetta's fuel efficiency (especially with the TDI engine), comfortable ride, and available features. Common dislikes include some reliability concerns, particularly with electrical components and certain engine issues, as well as higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

    * Solution: Replace the faulty MAF sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Turbo Inline-4 (AWW/AWP)**
* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, and a check engine light. This is a very common issue.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack(s). Consider replacing all coil packs at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the turbocharger, loss of power, excessive oil consumption, and a check engine light.

**Summary**

The 2001 Volkswagen Jetta can be a reliable and enjoyable car, but it is prone to certain issues, especially given its age. Engine issues, particularly with coil packs and vacuum leaks on the 1.8T, and coolant leaks on the 2.0L can be relatively inexpensive to fix. However, more significant problems like injection pump failure on the TDI or transmission issues on either automatic transmission can be costly. Electrical problems like window regulators and door lock actuators are also common. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of repairs when considering purchasing a 2001 Jetta. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
