The 2004 Volkswagen Jetta (Volkswagen Sedan) is a popular compact car known for its German engineering and handling. Available engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 115 hp and 122 lb-ft of torque, a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 producing 180 hp and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.9L TDI diesel engine producing 100 hp and 177 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (2.0L), a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic (1.8T), and a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (1.9L TDI). Owners often praise the Jetta's fuel efficiency (especially the TDI), solid build quality, and fun-to-drive character. Common complaints include electrical issues, some reliability concerns, and relatively small rear seats.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

**Summary**

The 2004 Volkswagen Jetta can be a rewarding car to own, but it's essential to be aware of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 1.8T (turbocharger and sludge) and the electrical system, represent the most significant concerns. Transmission issues are also common, especially in the automatic transmissions. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also prone to wear. The cost of repairs can range from relatively minor (sensor replacements) to substantial (turbocharger or engine replacement). A thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
