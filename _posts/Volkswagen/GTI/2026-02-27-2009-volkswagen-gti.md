### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Volkswagen GTI is a performance-oriented vehicle that, while generally well-regarded for its driving dynamics, exhibits some common reliability concerns. The 2.0L turbocharged engine can be prone to issues with the PCV system, ignition coils, and turbocharger, requiring attention. Transmission-wise, both the manual and the DSG automatic have potential wear items like the clutch and, in the case of the DSG, the complex mechatronic unit. Suspension components, particularly bushings and strut mounts, can also require replacement. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and HVAC resistors are not uncommon. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the GTI's performance and handling to be worth the upkeep, especially with diligent maintenance.
