### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Volkswagen GTI, particularly with the 2.0L FSI engine, can be a rewarding vehicle but requires awareness of potential issues. The engine's PCV system and timing chain tensioner are known weak points that can lead to significant problems if not addressed. The DSG transmission, while offering performance benefits, has a higher propensity for costly mechatronic unit and clutch pack failures compared to the manual. Electrical components like window regulators and HVAC resistors are also common repair items. Suspension, exterior, and interior generally hold up well, with no widespread critical failures reported. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the reliability of this performance-oriented hatchback.
