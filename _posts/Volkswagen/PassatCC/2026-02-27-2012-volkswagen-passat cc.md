### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Volkswagen Passat CC presents a generally reliable package, particularly for those prioritizing style and a premium feel. The most common concerns tend to revolve around the more complex powertrain options, specifically the DSG transmission's mechatronics unit and clutch wear, as well as potential timing chain and PCV issues on the 2.0L TSI engine. Diesel variants may encounter DPF or EGR problems. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches, are also noted. However, with proper maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the Passat CC can remain a dependable and enjoyable vehicle. The naturally aspirated VR6 and manual transmission variants appear to be less prone to significant mechanical issues.
