The 2010 Volkswagen Passat CC offers a compelling blend of style and performance, but potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 2.0L TSI engine is susceptible to timing chain and PCV valve issues, while the 3.6L VR6 can experience intake manifold problems. The DSG transmission, while offering quick shifts, has a known history of mechatronic unit and clutch pack failures.

Proactive maintenance, especially concerning the timing chain and transmission fluid changes, is recommended to mitigate these potential issues and ensure long-term reliability.
