# 2024 Honda Prologue

### Overview
The 2024 Honda Prologue, a new entrant in the electric SUV market, is built on GM's Ultium platform. As a first-year model, comprehensive long-term reliability data is still emerging. However, initial assessments and the shared platform with other GM EVs suggest a generally robust system. Honda's reputation for quality is expected to carry over, but as with any new technology, some early adopter observations may arise. This analysis focuses on potential areas of concern based on the platform and general EV trends, rather than specific documented failures for the Prologue itself, which are limited at this early stage.
