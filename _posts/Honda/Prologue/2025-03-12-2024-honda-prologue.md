The 2024 Honda Prologue marks Honda's entry into the all-electric SUV market. All trims are powered by an 85 kWh Ultium battery pack. The front-wheel drive version produces 212 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque, while the all-wheel drive version ups the output to 288 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Generally, owners appreciate the Prologue for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Honda's reputation for reliability, though some find the styling a bit bland compared to other EVs. Early adopters have experienced some software glitches and charging inconsistencies, which is not unusual for a first-year model.

**Summary**

The 2024 Honda Prologue, being a relatively new model, has a few reported issues that are not uncommon for a first-year EV. The most common issues revolve around the electrical system, particularly the infotainment system and charging speeds. While the power loss issue is a concern, it appears to be isolated to a small number of owners. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences like rattling noises to more significant problems like power loss. The cost to fix these issues can vary greatly depending on the problem, but many can be resolved with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs. As the Prologue matures and Honda releases software updates and addresses these early issues, overall reliability is expected to improve.
