# 2021 Honda Clarity

### Overview
The 2021 Honda Clarity, primarily known for its Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) and Electric Vehicle (EV) variants, generally exhibits strong reliability, reflecting Honda's reputation for building durable vehicles. Owners often praise its fuel efficiency and smooth driving experience. While specific data for a 2021 model year can be limited due to its relatively recent release and lower production numbers compared to more mainstream models, general trends from previous years and owner feedback suggest a well-engineered vehicle. The powertrain, particularly the hybrid system, has proven robust. However, as with any complex vehicle, certain components may experience issues over time, though widespread, critical failures are not commonly reported for this model year.
