**Introduction:**

The 2020 Honda Clarity is a midsize sedan available with either a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) or fuel cell (FCV) powertrain. The PHEV model has a 1.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and two electric motors, producing a combined 212 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. The FCV model uses a hydrogen fuel cell stack to generate electricity, powering an electric motor that produces 174 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Both models come standard with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). The Clarity is known for its fuel efficiency, advanced technology, and spacious interior, but it has faced some criticism for its high price and limited driving range for the FCV model.
