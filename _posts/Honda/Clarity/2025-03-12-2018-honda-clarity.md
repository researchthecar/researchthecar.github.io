The 2018 Honda Clarity came in three distinct versions: the Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV), the Electric (EV), and the Fuel Cell (FCV). This analysis focuses on the Plug-in Hybrid model, as it was the most widely available of the three. The 2018 Clarity Plug-in Hybrid features a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 212 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. The engine mainly acts as a generator for the electric motor and can directly power the wheels at higher speeds. The Clarity Plug-in Hybrid is known for its impressive electric-only range (around 47 miles), spacious interior, and comfortable ride. However, some common dislikes include its unconventional styling, somewhat sluggish acceleration when the battery is depleted, and limited availability of certain features.

**Electric Motor**

*No Issues Found*

**Battery System**

*   **Reduced Electric Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing a gradual decline in the vehicle's all-electric range over time, even with consistent charging habits. The vehicle may no longer achieve its original EPA-estimated range of 47 miles.
    *   Solution: Software updates may help to recalibrate the battery management system. In some cases, individual battery modules may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely. Recalibration might be covered under warranty or cost a few hundred dollars. Battery module replacement can range from $1,000 to $3,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failure to Charge**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle fails to initiate charging when plugged into a charging station or wall outlet. Error messages might appear on the dashboard, indicating a charging system fault.
    *   Solution: Check the charging cable and charging station for any damage or malfunctions. Inspect the vehicle's charging port for debris or corrosion. A faulty onboard charger or battery management system may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Onboard charger replacement can range from $800 - $1500+, depending on labor and parts availability. Charging port repair might be $200-$500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.5L Atkinson Cycle I4**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine hesitation or stalling, particularly during transitions between electric and gasoline power. This can occur during acceleration or when climbing hills.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the powertrain control module (PCM) can address some of these issues. In more severe cases, fuel system components or ignition coils may need to be inspected and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are usually covered by warranty or may be a minimal cost. Fuel system component repairs can range from $200 to $1000+ depending on the specific part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing squeaking or clunking noises emanating from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rear suspension components, including the shocks, struts, bushings, and sway bar links. Worn or damaged bushings are often the culprit and require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing replacement can range from $150 to $500+, depending on the location and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may experience glitches, freezing, or unresponsiveness. Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation problems, and screen blackouts have also been reported.
    *   Solution: Try performing a system reset or updating the infotainment software. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates might be free or low cost. Head unit replacement can range from $500 to $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the blind spot monitoring system, leading to no warnings of a vehicle in the blind spot. Warning lights may be present on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sensor for damage and connectivity. The sensor will likely need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight assemblies, causing condensation and reduced visibility.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with drilling small drain holes in the headlight housings. If the condensation is severe, headlight replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Drilling is a DIY fix. Headlight replacement can range from $300 to $800+ per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**

**Summary:**

The 2018 Honda Clarity Plug-in Hybrid, while a fuel-efficient and spacious vehicle, has exhibited some common issues. While some are relatively minor, such as headlight condensation or infotainment glitches, others, like battery degradation and engine hesitation, can be more concerning. The cost to address these problems varies significantly, ranging from a few hundred dollars for software updates or bushing replacements to potentially several thousand dollars for battery module or head unit replacements. While the issues aren't universally reported, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchasing, and also ask for service history to verify the vehicle has been updated to mitigate the issues.
