**2021 Honda Clarity**

The 2021 Honda Clarity is a plug-in hybrid sedan that offers an electric-only driving range of up to 47 miles. It features a 1.5-liter inline-four gasoline engine paired with a 181-hp electric motor for a combined output of 212 hp and 232 lb-ft of torque. The Clarity is available with two transmission options: an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (e-CVT) and a 6-speed manual transmission.

The Clarity received praise for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and advanced safety features. However, some owners have reported various issues with the vehicle.

**Engine**

**1.5-liter Inline-Four Gasoline Engine**

* **Intake Valve Deposits:** Over time, carbon deposits can build up on the intake valves, leading to reduced engine power and efficiency. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and decreased fuel economy. Cleaning the intake valves can resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
* **Oil Leaks:** Some Clarity models have experienced oil leaks from the valve cover gasket. Symptoms include oil stains under the vehicle and a burning oil smell. Replacing the valve cover gasket is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
* **Piston Ring Failure:** In rare cases, piston rings have failed prematurely, causing excessive oil consumption and engine damage. Rebuilding the engine is the only solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000+

**Transmission**

**e-CVT**

* **Shuddering During Acceleration:** Some e-CVT transmissions have exhibited shuddering or vibration during acceleration. Software updates or transmission replacement may be necessary to fix the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000
* **Transmission Noise:** A whining or grinding noise from the transmission has been reported by some owners. Replacing the transmission fluid or specific transmission components may resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000
* **ECM Failure:** The Engine Control Module (ECM) has failed in some Clarity models, resulting in transmission problems. Replacing the ECM is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Gear Grinding:** Some manual transmission Claritys have experienced gear grinding when shifting. Adjusting the transmission linkage or replacing the clutch may resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600
* **Shifter Cable Failure:** The shifter cable has failed in some models, causing difficulty shifting gears. Replacing the shifter cable is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**Summary**

The 2021 Honda Clarity is a well-regarded plug-in hybrid sedan, but it has not been without its issues. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with some being minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, while others can be more serious and require major repairs.
