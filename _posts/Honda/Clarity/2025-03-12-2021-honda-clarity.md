The 2021 Honda Clarity was available exclusively as a Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV). It combined a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a 17-kWh battery pack. The combined system output was 212 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. It used an Electronically Continuously Variable Transmission (E-CVT). Owners generally appreciated the Clarity's smooth ride, spacious interior, and electric-only driving range (around 47 miles). Common complaints included limited cargo space, a sometimes-noisy gasoline engine, and the fact it was discontinued after 2021.

**Summary:**

The 2021 Honda Clarity, while appreciated for its efficiency and comfort, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Battery degradation can lead to reduced electric range and high replacement costs in the long run, however, the battery should be under warranty for quite a while. Electrical glitches can be annoying but are usually fixable with software updates. Interior noises are fairly common but do not affect the operability of the vehicle. While not widespread, these potential problems should be considered when evaluating a used 2021 Clarity.
