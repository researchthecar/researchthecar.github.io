The 2022 Honda Clarity was only offered as a Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). It combines a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine (103 hp, 99 lb-ft torque) with an electric motor (181 hp, 232 lb-ft torque) for a combined system output of 212 horsepower. Power is delivered through a CVT transmission. Owners appreciate the Clarity's electric-only driving range (47 miles), fuel efficiency when operating as a hybrid, and comfortable ride. Some common complaints include the limited availability of the model (production ended in 2021), limited cargo space due to the battery pack, and a somewhat dated interior design.
