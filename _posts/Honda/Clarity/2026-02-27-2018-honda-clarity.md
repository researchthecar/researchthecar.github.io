## Engine

### 1.5L Atkinson-Cycle 4-Cylinder (PHEV)
**Hybrid System Malfunction Indicator Light**
- **Symptoms:** Illuminated warning light, potential reduction in electric-only range or overall performance.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis of hybrid system components, including battery, inverter, or electric motor. Software updates or component replacement may be necessary.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1500

**Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Hesitation**
- **Symptoms:** Slight hesitation or rough running when the gasoline engine engages, particularly at lower speeds.
- **Solution:** Check for software updates for the engine control module (ECM) or fuel system issues. Spark plug replacement or fuel injector cleaning may be required.
- **Cost:** $150 - $500


### Electric Motor (EV & PHEV)
**Reduced Power Output**
- **Symptoms:** Noticeable decrease in acceleration and overall power, especially when the battery is depleted.
