Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 Honda Clarity Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV), organized by category. The 2017 Clarity was only offered as a PHEV with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine (103 hp, 99 lb-ft of torque) paired with an electric motor for a combined system output of 181 hp and 232 lb-ft of torque. The transmission is an electronic continuously variable transmission (E-CVT). Owners often praise the Clarity's fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Common complaints include limited all-electric range compared to some competitors, the infotainment system can be unintuitive, and some find the styling polarizing.

**Electric Motor**

* **Electric Motor Hesitation/Loss of Power**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a hesitation or momentary loss of power when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds in electric-only mode. This can feel like a brief stutter or lag. Some also complain of low acceleration compared to advertised numbers.
    * Solution: In some cases, this can be resolved with a software update to the powertrain control module (PCM) or the battery management system (BMS). In other cases, replacement of a faulty electric motor control unit (MCU) or even the electric motor itself may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. MCU or motor replacement can range from $2,000 - $5,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **High Voltage Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the high-voltage battery capacity can degrade, resulting in a shorter all-electric driving range. This is a normal phenomenon for all electric vehicles but can be accelerated by frequent fast charging or extreme temperatures.
    * Solution: While some battery degradation is expected, excessive degradation may be covered under the hybrid component warranty. Replacement of the high-voltage battery pack is the ultimate solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+ (Battery pack replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**E-CVT Transmission**

* **Transmission Jerking/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing jerking or harsh shifting, particularly during transitions between electric and gasoline power. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds or when climbing hills.
    * Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) might resolve the issue. In more severe cases, internal transmission damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (covered under warranty). Transmission rebuild: $2,500 - $4,000. Transmission replacement: $4,000 - $6,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven road surfaces.
    * Solution: Inspection of the rear suspension components, including the shocks, struts, and sway bar links. Replacing worn or damaged bushings, struts, or other components may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the parts needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be prone to freezing, crashing, or becoming unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    * Solution: Performing a system reset or updating the infotainment software might resolve the issue. In some cases, replacement of the head unit may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (covered under warranty). Head unit replacement: $500 - $1500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **12V Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the 12V battery, which can cause starting problems, electrical glitches, and error messages. The Clarity relies on the 12V battery to boot the car and turn on the high-voltage system.
    * Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery with an upgraded or higher-quality battery. Ensuring proper charging system function.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation buildup inside the headlight housings.
    * Solution: Replacement of the headlight assembly. Sealing the headlight housing to prevent moisture ingress.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per headlight (replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Discomfort**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some drivers find the front seats uncomfortable, especially on long trips, due to lack of sufficient support or adjustability.
    * Solution: Aftermarket seat cushions or professional upholstery modifications to improve comfort.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+

**Summary**

The 2017 Honda Clarity Plug-in Hybrid generally proves to be a reliable vehicle, but like any car, it's susceptible to some common issues. The most concerning potential problems involve the electric motor and transmission, which can be expensive to repair if problems arise. The infotainment system and 12V battery are other areas that owners should be aware of. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history, look for any signs of the described symptoms, and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with hybrid vehicles.
