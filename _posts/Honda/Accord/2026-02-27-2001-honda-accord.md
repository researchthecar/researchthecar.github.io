### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Honda Accord is a solid choice for a used car, with a strong reputation for reliability. The most common issues tend to be related to the automatic transmission, particularly with harsh shifting or slipping, and potential oil leaks from the engine's rear main seal or valve covers. For V6 models, timely timing belt replacement is crucial to avoid catastrophic engine damage. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical components such as the alternator and power window motors are also noted points of failure. Exterior paint, specifically the clear coat, can degrade over time. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential problems, the 2001 Accord can continue to provide dependable service.
