The powertrain, including both the 2.4L 4-cylinder and 3.5L V6 engines, is exceptionally robust. The CVT transmission has seen some isolated reports of hesitation or shuddering, but these are not widespread and often resolvable with maintenance or software updates. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system's touchscreen responsiveness and occasional battery drain, are the most commonly cited non-routine issues, though still affecting a minority of vehicles. Overall, the 2016 Accord is a solid choice for those seeking dependable transportation with minimal unexpected repair costs.
