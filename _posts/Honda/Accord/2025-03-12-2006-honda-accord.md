The 2006 Honda Accord is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 166 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.0L V6 engine producing 244 horsepower and 211 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (only on the 4-cylinder) and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Accord's longevity, smooth handling, and practical design. Common dislikes include uninspired styling, some interior material quality issues, and certain mechanical problems that arise with age.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L engine, particularly in higher mileage examples, is prone to excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include the need to frequently add oil between changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: There is not a simple fix for this issue. Many owners resort to more frequent oil changes, using heavier weight oil, or, in severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start, lasting for a few seconds, often indicates a failing Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator. This is more common in the 2.4L engines.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VTC actuator and potentially the timing chain tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Valve Adjustment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The J30 V6 engine requires periodic valve adjustments, and if neglected, can lead to rough idling, reduced performance, and potential valve damage.
    *   Solution: Valve adjustment by a qualified mechanic.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both 4-Cylinder and V6)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during gear changes, slipping between gears, or harsh/jerky shifts can indicate transmission problems, particularly in higher mileage vehicles.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush, solenoid replacement, or, in severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the rear suspension, particularly the springs, can sag, leading to a lower ride height and reduced handling. Squeaking noises from the rear suspension are also common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of rear springs, shocks/struts, and potentially bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks, often affecting one or more doors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, often due to parasitic draws from faulty electrical components or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the source of the battery drain. This can include replacing faulty relays, modules, or addressing wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches and Rocker Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the rear wheel arches and rocker panels, especially in areas with harsh winter conditions.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, body work, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sun visors are known to break or the support arm that holds them in place can easily break.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty sun visor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Honda Accord is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it can experience certain issues. The most significant concerns relate to the 2.4L engine's oil consumption and transmission problems in higher mileage examples. Suspension and electrical issues are also common. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs like engine rebuilds or transmission replacements can be costly. Addressing these issues proactively can help extend the life of the vehicle.
