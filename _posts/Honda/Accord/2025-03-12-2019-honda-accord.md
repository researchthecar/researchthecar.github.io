    *   Solution: Honda released a software update to the ECU to address oil consumption issues by adjusting fuel mapping, which could help reduce oil consumption. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update - $0 - $100. Piston ring replacement - $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and a noticeable decrease in fuel economy are symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800

**Summary**

The 2019 Honda Accord is generally a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues reported by owners. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission juddering in the 1.5L models and infotainment system glitches. Oil consumption in the 1.5L can also be a concern, but it is not as prevalent. While the cost to fix these issues can vary, CVT replacements and internal transmission repairs can be relatively expensive. A thorough inspection of these areas is recommended before purchasing a used 2019 Honda Accord.
