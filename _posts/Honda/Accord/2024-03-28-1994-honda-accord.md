    * **Valve seat recession:** Valve seats can recess over time, causing valve leakage. This can lead to a loss of compression, poor fuel economy, and increased emissions. The cylinder head must be replaced to fix the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $3,000+
    * **VTEC solenoid failure:** The VTEC solenoid can fail, causing the engine to lose power at high RPMs. The solenoid can be replaced to fix the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400+

**Transmission**

* **Five-speed manual**
    * **Clutch wear:** The clutch can wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting gears or slipping. The clutch and pressure plate must be replaced to fix the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Four-speed automatic**
    * **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter can shudder when shifting gears. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including worn clutches, a faulty torque converter, or a problem with the transmission fluid. The transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced to fix the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $2,500+
* **Five-speed automatic**
    * **Shift solenoid failure:** A shift solenoid can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. The solenoid can be replaced to fix the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400+
