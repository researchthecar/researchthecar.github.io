The 2022 Honda Accord is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. Engine options include a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. There is also a 2.0L inline-4 hybrid engine available, producing 212 total system horsepower. The 1.5L engine is paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), and the 2.0L engine is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. People generally praise the Accord for its comfortable ride, responsive handling, and user-friendly technology. Criticisms often include a somewhat bland exterior styling and the CVT transmission in the 1.5L model, which some find less engaging than a traditional automatic.
