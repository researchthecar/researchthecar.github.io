The 2015 Honda Accord is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. It's available with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 185 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 278 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is typically paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 3.5L engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the Accord for its comfortable ride, responsive handling, and strong resale value. Common dislikes include the sometimes-uninspiring interior styling and the CVT's droning sound under heavy acceleration.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Direct Injection Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the direct injection fuel injectors becoming clogged or malfunctioning, leading to rough idling, misfires, poor fuel economy, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors is typically necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Earth Dreams Engine Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: This can be a difficult issue to resolve. Some have had success with piston ring replacement or even engine replacement, while others have opted to monitor oil levels and top off as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VCM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can sometimes cause vibrations, rough idling, and spark plug fouling due to oil blow-by into deactivated cylinders.
    *   Solution: Disabling the VCM system with aftermarket devices is a common workaround.  Replacing the VCM actuator/solenoid or addressing oil control issues can also be done.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (VCM disabler), $500 - $1500+ (Actuator/Solenoid or Engine Work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (2.4L Engine)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Some owners have experienced juddering or shuddering during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be caused by worn CVT fluid, a failing torque converter, or issues with the CVT chain/belt.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change is the first step.  If that doesn't resolve the issue, torque converter or complete CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change), $2000 - $5000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (3.5L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change is the first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change), $800 - $3000+ (valve body or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Suspension Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing premature wear of suspension components such as struts, shocks, and control arm bushings. This can lead to a bouncy ride, clunking noises, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn suspension components is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per corner, depending on the components replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing unexpected battery drain, even with a relatively new battery. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution:  Diagnosing and isolating the source of the parasitic drain is necessary. This may involve testing various circuits and components to identify the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Display Screen Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Some owners have reported issues with the infotainment display screen, including freezing, glitches, and failure to respond to touch inputs.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a software update can fix this. Otherwise, the head unit must be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on whether software fixes the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housing leading to condensation. This can reduce visibility and potentially damage the headlight bulb.
    *   Solution: Drying out the headlight and resealing, or replacing the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Cupholder Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: The cupholders in the center console are prone to breaking or cracking
    * Solution: Replacement of the cupholder assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sun Visor Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The sun visors can become loose and sag over time, making it difficult to keep them in place.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visor assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per visor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Honda Accord is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported issues across various categories. Engine problems, particularly related to oil consumption in the 2.4L and VCM in the 3.5L, can be costly. CVT issues in the 2.4L are another area of concern. Other problems, such as electrical glitches and suspension wear, are less severe but can still require attention. While no widespread recalls address these specific issues, it's essential to research further based on your specific engine/transmission configuration and be prepared for potential maintenance costs. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, check service records, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
