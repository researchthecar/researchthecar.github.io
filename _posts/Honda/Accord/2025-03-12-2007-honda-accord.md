The 2007 Honda Accord is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability and practicality. It came with several engine and transmission options. The most common engine is the 2.4L inline-4, producing around 166 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque, and can be paired with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. There's also the 3.0L V6, which delivers around 244 horsepower and 211 lb-ft of torque, coupled with a 5-speed automatic. People generally appreciate the Accord for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common dislikes include some styling elements (subjective), and in some cases, reported issues with oil consumption and transmission issues with certain engine configurations.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected. This often manifests as a noticeable drop in the oil level between oil changes.
    *   Solution: The issue may stem from worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A mechanic can perform an oil consumption test to diagnose the problem. Depending on the severity, the solution could range from replacing valve stem seals to a full engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (with 2.4L Inline-4)**

* **Transmission Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience failures, exhibiting symptoms like slipping between gears, harsh shifting, or complete loss of gear engagement.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the transmission. It is important to have a mechanic properly diagnose the issues to ensure correct parts are used to do the repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (with 3.0L V6)**

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some models experience torque converter failure. Symptoms include shuddering or vibrating at low speeds, especially during acceleration, as well as stalling or poor acceleration.
    * Solution: Torque converter replacement. It's advisable to flush the transmission fluid during the repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the rear suspension sagging over time, leading to reduced ride height and potentially causing a knocking or clunking noise from the rear end, particularly when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear springs and shocks. In some cases, worn bushings may also need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue is the failure of power door lock actuators. This can manifest as one or more doors failing to lock or unlock with the power locks, or making unusual noises when attempting to operate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience unexpected battery drain, particularly if the car sits for extended periods. This can make it difficult to start the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the parasitic drain by testing various electrical components to find the cause of the drain. Depending on the source, repairs can range from replacing a faulty component to repairing wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard surface, particularly in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard. (Often not pursued due to high cost). Dash covers are a common alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Honda Accord is generally a reliable vehicle, but certain issues are prevalent. The most significant concern is the potential for transmission issues, particularly with the automatic transmissions. Excessive oil consumption with the 2.4L engine is another notable issue. Electrical problems such as door lock actuator failures and suspension issues such as rear suspension sag are relatively common and contribute to the overall cost of ownership. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor electrical fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. The severity of these issues varies between individual vehicles, and proper maintenance can help mitigate some of these problems.
