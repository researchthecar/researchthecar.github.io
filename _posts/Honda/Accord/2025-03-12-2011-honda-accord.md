**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running rough.
    *   Solution: Honda issued a service bulletin and extended the warranty for certain affected vehicles. The fix typically involves replacing the piston rings. In severe cases, the entire engine may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ (depending on severity and repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle on Startup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise on cold starts lasting for a few seconds. This is often attributed to the Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VTC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VCM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can cause vibrations, rough idling, and increased oil consumption. Some owners report spark plug fouling due to the system.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include disabling the VCM system with aftermarket devices (VCM Tuner), or replacing the VCM solenoid valve. In severe cases, spark plug or engine damage may require more extensive repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (VCM Tuner), $300 - $800+ (VCM solenoid replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil drips on the exhaust manifold and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both 2.4L and 3.5L)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report shuddering or vibrations, especially at lower speeds. This can be a sign of torque converter failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit delayed engagement when shifting between gears, or shift harshly. This can be due to low transmission fluid, worn solenoids, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Start by checking and changing the transmission fluid. If the problem persists, solenoid replacement or a transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid change), $300 - $800 (solenoid replacement), $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement).
