*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, especially in higher mileage vehicles. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can resolve the issue. Performing regular oil changes with the correct type of oil can help to prevent it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

    *   Solution: Replacing the VTC actuator can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Honda Accord is generally reliable, but like any older vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Engine issues like oil consumption and timing belt replacement on the V6 can be costly. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic transmission, are also a significant concern. Suspension and electrical issues are relatively common but are typically less expensive to address than major engine or transmission repairs. Rust can be a cosmetic and structural issue. Overall, when considering a 2003 Honda Accord, a thorough inspection is recommended, paying close attention to the condition of the engine, transmission, and suspension. Potential buyers should factor in the cost of any necessary repairs when assessing the vehicle's value.
