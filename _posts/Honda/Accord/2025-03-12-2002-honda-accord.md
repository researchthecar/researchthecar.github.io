Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2002 Honda Accord, following the format you requested.

The 2002 Honda Accord is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a 2.3L inline-4 and a 3.0L V6. The 2.3L i4 produced around 150 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L V6 produced approximately 200 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Most owners appreciate the Accord's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and overall dependability. Common dislikes include relatively bland styling (subjective) and some reported issues with certain components as the car ages. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic with the I4 engine and a 5-speed automatic with the V6 engine.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: The issue can be caused by worn piston rings or valve seals. Replacing these components may resolve the problem, but it's a labor-intensive repair. Switching to a higher viscosity oil can sometimes help reduce consumption but is not a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (Engine rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic idling, stalling, especially when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve cover area, often dripping onto the exhaust manifold causing a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure (If not replaced)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the timing belt hasn't been replaced at the recommended interval (typically 105,000 miles), it can break, causing significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt and water pump before failure is crucial. If failure occurs, engine repair or replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
        *   Timing Belt/Water Pump Replacement: $400 - $800
        *   Engine Repair/Replacement (after failure): $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (with 2.3L i4)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to engage gears properly.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change can sometimes help, but often indicates internal wear. Rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Fluid Change) / $1500 - $3500+ (Rebuild or Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (with 3.0L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to engage gears properly.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change can sometimes help, but often indicates internal wear. Rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Fluid Change) / $1500 - $3500+ (Rebuild or Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll in turns, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000 (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Steering can feel loose or unstable.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per side (depending on whether bushings or entire arm is replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**

**Summary**

The 2002 Honda Accord, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues given its age. Engine and transmission problems, such as oil consumption and transmission slipping, can be costly to address. Suspension and electrical issues are also common. Rust, particularly in areas with harsh winters, can be a significant concern. Overall, while not all 2002 Accords will experience these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and inspect vehicles carefully before purchasing. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconvenience to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
