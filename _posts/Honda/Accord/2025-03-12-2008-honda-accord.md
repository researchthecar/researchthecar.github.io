Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints related to the 2008 Honda Accord, organized by category and engine/transmission option as requested.

The 2008 Honda Accord is a popular mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder and a 3.5L V6. The 2.4L engine produced around 177 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5L V6 generated approximately 268 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic (available with both engines), and a 6-speed manual (available only with the V6 engine on certain trims). Owners often praise the Accord for its longevity, smooth handling, and reputation for holding its value. However, some common complaints include issues with oil consumption, particularly in the 4-cylinder models, as well as certain electrical and interior trim concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report high oil consumption, sometimes exceeding 1 quart every 1,000 miles. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and frequent oil top-offs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Honda issued a service bulletin addressing this issue, suggesting a piston ring replacement. This is a costly repair, so some owners opt for more frequent oil checks and top-offs. The issue is not always resolved with the piston ring replacement, and engine replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (piston ring replacement or engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both 2.4L and 3.5L)**

*   **Transmission Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation when shifting, particularly between gears 2 and 3. Shifting may also feel rough or jerky.
    *   Solution: A software update (reprogramming the transmission control module - TCM) might alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, transmission replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Software Update), $2,500 - $4,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual (2.4L)**

*No Issues Found*

**6-Speed Manual (3.5L)**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises emanating from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Often caused by worn rear sway bar bushings or end links. Replacement of these components resolves the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Driver's Power Window Switch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The driver's side power window switch stops working, preventing operation of the driver's side window and sometimes other windows as well.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the driver's side power window switch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Daytime Running Light (DRL) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or both daytime running lights stop functioning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the DRL bulbs or, in some cases, the DRL module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing. This can reduce visibility and potentially damage the headlight components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headlight assembly or attempting to seal the existing headlight unit to prevent moisture intrusion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per headlight)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks develop in the dashboard, particularly in sun-exposed areas.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is the only permanent fix, but it is a very costly repair. Some owners opt for dashboard covers to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ (Dashboard Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sun Visor Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors droop down and do not stay in the upright position.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (per visor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Honda Accord is generally a reliable vehicle, but it is not without its potential issues. The most significant concern is the excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L inline-4 engine, which can be costly to repair. Other common issues include transmission hesitation, suspension noise, and electrical component failures. The interior may also suffer from dashboard cracking and sun visor sagging. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more significant and costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase, especially checking the oil levels, and asking about the history of oil consumption.
