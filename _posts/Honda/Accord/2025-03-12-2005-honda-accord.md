The 2005 Honda Accord is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. Available engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 and a 3.0L V6. The 2.4L produced around 160 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L V6 generated approximately 240 horsepower and 212 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners generally appreciate the Accord's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for longevity. Common dislikes often revolve around perceived bland styling and, in some cases, specific issues related to the automatic transmission and some electrical components as they age.

**Summary**

The 2005 Honda Accord, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic transmission, can be a significant concern and costly to repair. Engine oil leaks and timing belt issues (on the V6) are also common as the vehicle ages. Electrical problems, such as failing door lock actuators, are relatively minor but can be annoying. Rust can be a concern, depending on the climate. Overall, while the Accord is known for its longevity, potential buyers should have these issues inspected before purchasing to avoid unexpected repairs.
