Available engine options include a 2.3L 4-cylinder engine producing approximately 135-150 horsepower and 152-156 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine producing approximately 200 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque.

**Engine**

**2.3L 4-Cylinder**

* **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported higher than normal oil consumption, especially as the vehicle aged. Symptoms include the need to add oil more frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels, use of heavier weight oil if recommended by a mechanic, and potentially replacing valve stem seals or piston rings in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Distributor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The distributor can fail over time, leading to issues such as rough running, misfires, difficulty starting, or a complete no-start condition.
    * Solution: Replacing the distributor with a new or remanufactured unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

* **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The valve cover gaskets are prone to leaking as they age. This leads to oil accumulating on the engine, potentially causing a burning smell, and if left unaddressed, can lead to a drop in oil level.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

* **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can develop slipping between gears, harsh shifting, or failure to shift at all. This is often due to worn clutch packs or valve body issues.
    * Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid regularly can help prevent this. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $2000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, components such as ball joints, tie rod ends, struts, and shocks can wear out, leading to a loose or bouncy ride, clunking noises, and poor handling.
    * Solution: Replacing worn suspension components. A full suspension overhaul might be required on older vehicles.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component (depending on the component and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power window motors or regulators can fail, causing the windows to stop working.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty window motor or regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per window
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Dimming Instrument Cluster Lights**
    * Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster lights can dim or flicker due to a faulty dimmer switch or aging bulbs.
    * Solution: Replacing the dimmer switch or instrument cluster bulbs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust (Specific Locations)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust is a common issue, particularly in areas with harsh winters or where road salt is used. Common rust locations include the rear quarter panels, rocker panels, and wheel wells.
    * Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per panel (depending on severity and repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroofs can become stuck, leak, or the motor can fail.
    * Solution: Cleaning the sunroof drains, lubricating the tracks, or replacing the motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Honda Accord is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it's prone to certain issues. Engine problems such as oil consumption and leaks can be costly to address, while transmission issues can range from requiring a simple fluid change to a complete overhaul. Suspension wear and electrical problems are also common. Rust is a significant concern in certain climates. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the vehicle's condition and the specific issue. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
