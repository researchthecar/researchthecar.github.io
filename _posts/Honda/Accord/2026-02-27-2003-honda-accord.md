### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Honda Accord is a generally dependable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it is susceptible to specific issues. The 2.4L engine's oil consumption and VTEC solenoid problems, along with the V6's timing belt and VCM concerns, are notable. Automatic transmissions can experience torque converter shudder and harsh shifting. Suspension components like ball joints and struts are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and power window motors are also reported. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling and interior problems with the HVAC blower motor are also points to consider. Despite these potential drawbacks, with proper maintenance and timely repairs, the 2003 Accord can remain a cost-effective and reliable mode of transportation.
