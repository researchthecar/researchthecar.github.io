## Engine

### 2.4L i-VTEC (K24Z7)
**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning between oil changes, potentially leading to low oil levels.

- **Cost:** $800 - $1500

**Variable Timing Control (VTC) Actuator**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise on startup, especially when cold.

### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Honda Accord is a solid choice for reliability, with most owners experiencing trouble-free operation. The primary areas to monitor are potential oil consumption and VTC actuator noise on the 2.4L engine, and the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system on the 3.5L V6, which can lead to more significant issues if not maintained properly.
