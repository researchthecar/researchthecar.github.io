The 2014 Honda Accord is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. Available engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder and a 3.5L V6. The 2.4L engine produces 185 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5L engine generates 278 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) available only with the 2.4L engine. Owners generally appreciate the Accord's comfortable ride, good fuel economy, and reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include the sometimes uninspiring styling and, for some, the road noise.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Direct Injection Fuel System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, and reduced fuel economy may occur due to carbon buildup on the intake valves. This is a common issue with direct injection engines.
    *   Solution: Professional cleaning of the intake valves to remove carbon deposits is required. Options include walnut blasting or chemical cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak around the valve cover, burning oil smell, and potentially low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idling, and misfires. VCM deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but this can sometimes lead to these issues.
    *   Solution: While Honda has released software updates to address the VCM-related oil consumption, some owners resort to installing aftermarket VCM disabler devices. Another solution includes replacing piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (VCM Disabler), $1500 - $3000+ (Piston Ring Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) - 2.4L Engine Only**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shaking or vibrating during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can be caused by wear and tear on the CVT belt or issues with the transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT fluid can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (Fluid Change), $3000 - $5000+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic - 2.4L & 3.5L Engines**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than usual, especially when loaded. Worn rear springs are the likely cause.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period, making it difficult to start the car. A parasitic drain from a faulty module or accessory is the likely cause.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the parasitic drain, which may involve replacing a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Display Screen Issues (Navigation/Infotainment)**
