**Introduction:**

The 2001 Honda Accord is a midsize sedan that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options.

Both engines could be paired with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The Accord was praised for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior, but it was criticized for its bland styling and uninspiring driving dynamics.
