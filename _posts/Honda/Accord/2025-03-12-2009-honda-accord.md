The 2009 Honda Accord is a mid-size sedan known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Available engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 177 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 271 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 came standard with a 5-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the Accord's spacious interior, smooth handling, and strong resale value. Common complaints include concerns about excessive oil consumption in some engines, and issues with the automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2009 Honda Accord 2.4L engines experience high oil consumption, requiring owners to add oil frequently between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the oil level dropping significantly within a short period, leading to a low oil pressure warning light illuminating on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Honda issued a service bulletin and extended the warranty on certain 2008-2013 Accords with the 2.4L engine due to this issue. The solution involves a diagnostic oil consumption test by the dealership, and if excessive consumption is confirmed, the engine short block may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle on Startup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold startup that lasts for a few seconds. This is caused by a faulty Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VTC actuator. An updated part design has been implemented to resolve this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Transmission Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation when accelerating, particularly when shifting between gears. In addition to hesitation, they also may experience rough or jerky shifting.
    *   Solution: First, check and replace the transmission fluid, and see if that resolves the issue. If the problem is still present, it may be a valve body issue and the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for fluid replacement. $2,500 - $4,000+ for rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or a dead battery after the car has been sitting for a short period. Can be caused by a parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic draw and repair of the faulty component. Common causes include the HandsFreeLink (Bluetooth) module and aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HandsFreeLink (Bluetooth) Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HandsFreeLink system malfunctioning or not working. This can manifest as difficulty pairing a phone, being unable to make or receive calls, or the system failing to connect to the phone at all. It may also cause a parasitic battery drain.
