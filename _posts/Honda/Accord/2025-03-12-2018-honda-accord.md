The 2018 Honda Accord marked a significant redesign, offering a more stylish and sporty aesthetic compared to its predecessors. Engine options included a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid powertrain. The 1.5L was paired with either a CVT or a 6-speed manual, while the 2.0L came with a 10-speed automatic. People generally liked the Accord's improved handling, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. Some common dislikes included the infotainment system's learning curve and some concerns about the long-term reliability of the new turbo engines.
