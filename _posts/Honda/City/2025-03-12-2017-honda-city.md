Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2017 Honda City, following your specified format. The 2017 Honda City is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and reliability. Engine options typically include a 1.5L i-VTEC inline-4 producing around 117 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a CVT transmission. While generally well-regarded, some owners have reported experiencing certain issues. Common praises include its fuel economy, comfortable ride, and spacious rear seats, while some criticisms include its somewhat bland styling and the CVT transmission's performance.

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC (L15Z1) Inline-4**

*   **Engine Knocking/Rattling Noise (Cold Start)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a knocking or rattling noise upon starting the engine, especially when cold. The noise usually diminishes as the engine warms up. This can be due to excessive carbon buildup, the engine struggling for lubrication, or worn engine bearings.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic check to determine the source of the noise.  Possible solutions include engine decarbonization treatment, oil system flush, or engine bearing replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2017 Honda City consumes an excessive amount of engine oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This could be a result of worn piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: Oil consumption test to confirm the issue. Potential fixes include replacing the piston rings, valve seals, or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Shuddering/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a shuddering or jerking sensation, particularly during light acceleration or when the CVT is "searching" for the optimal ratio.
    *   Solution: First, try a CVT fluid change using Honda-specified fluid. If the problem persists, the CVT valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In severe cases, a complete CVT replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners experience a delay or hesitation when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive or Reverse, or when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Check the CVT fluid level and condition. Perform a CVT fluid change. If the issue persists, further diagnosis of the CVT is needed, potentially involving valve body or internal component inspection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report noises (clunking, rattling) emanating from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven road surfaces. This can be due to worn shock absorbers, bushings, or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rear suspension components, including shock absorbers, bushings, sway bar links, and mounting points. Replace any worn or damaged parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, causing starting problems or requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Check the battery's condition and charging system. Look for parasitic draws by testing the current draw when the car is off. Common causes include faulty alternators, aftermarket accessories, or a malfunctioning electrical component not fully shutting off.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (if equipped) occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. Check for software updates from Honda. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation buildup inside the headlight lenses.
    *   Solution: Check headlight housing seals and vents. Replace any damaged or missing seals. Applying a hydrophobic sealant to the lens can help. In severe cases, the entire headlight assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air from the air conditioning system.
    *   Solution: Check the refrigerant level, compressor clutch, and condenser fan. Repair or replace any faulty components. A system leak test may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Honda City is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues, particularly related to the CVT transmission and engine noises. Electrical and interior issues also surface periodically. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but addressing them promptly can help maintain the vehicle's longevity.
