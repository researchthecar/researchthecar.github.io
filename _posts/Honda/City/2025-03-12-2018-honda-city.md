Alright, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Honda City, categorized as requested.

The 2018 Honda City is a popular subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and reliability. In the Philippines, the 2018 City came with two engine options, the 1.5L i-VTEC inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 118 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, and the 1.5L i-DTEC diesel engine producing around 99 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) for the gasoline engine, and a 6-speed manual or CVT for the diesel. Owners often praise the City for its practicality, comfortable ride, and relatively low running costs. Common dislikes include a somewhat bland design and occasionally underwhelming performance, depending on the engine choice.

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC (Gasoline)**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, loss of power, check engine light illuminated. Often caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Diagnosis with an OBDII scanner to pinpoint the affected cylinder(s) is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the number of components replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak around the valve cover, burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L i-DTEC (Diesel)**

*   **DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, DPF warning light illuminated, frequent forced regeneration cycles.
    *   Solution: Attempt forced regeneration (if possible), clean the DPF, or replace the DPF if severely clogged. Ensure proper driving habits to promote passive regeneration (longer trips at higher speeds).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (cleaning) to $1000+ (replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, black smoke from the exhaust, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both Gasoline and Diesel)**

*   **Juddering/Shaking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable shaking or juddering during acceleration from a standstill or at low speeds (e.g., in stop-and-go traffic). This is often caused by degradation of the CVT fluid or wear within the CVT unit itself.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid change using Honda-specified fluid. If the problem persists, more extensive CVT repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid change), $2000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between putting the transmission in drive or reverse and the car actually moving.
    *   Solution: Start with a CVT fluid change. If the problem persists, it could indicate internal CVT damage requiring professional diagnosis and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid change), $1500+ (repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision.
    *   Solution: Replace worn bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, leaking fluid from the shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the shocks and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Check for parasitic draws. Replace the battery if necessary. Investigate and repair any circuits causing excessive drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response, Bluetooth connectivity problems, screen malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available), reset the system, or replace the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500+ (head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlight assembly, dry it out, and reseal it. Check for cracks or damage to the housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+ depending on the severity and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air, unusual noises from the A/C compressor.
    *   Solution: Recharge the refrigerant, check for leaks, inspect the compressor and other A/C components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (recharge) to $800+ (compressor replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various rattling noises coming from the dashboard, door panels, or rear shelf.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and apply foam padding or other damping materials to eliminate the noise. Tighten loose screws or fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ depending on the source and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

Overall, the 2018 Honda City is generally a reliable vehicle. The most common issues revolve around the CVT transmission (juddering/delayed engagement) and the diesel engine's DPF/EGR system. Electrical and suspension issues are also reported, but tend to be less frequent. Repair costs can range from relatively minor (e.g., replacing a sensor or changing fluids) to more substantial (e.g., CVT replacement). While most of these issues are not catastrophic, potential buyers should be aware of them and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic, especially if considering a City with high mileage.
