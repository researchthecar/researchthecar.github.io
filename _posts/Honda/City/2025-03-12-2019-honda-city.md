The 2019 Honda City is a popular subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior for its class, and reliability. It's generally well-regarded for its practicality and ease of driving. However, some owners have reported certain issues. The 2019 Honda City was primarily offered with a 1.5L i-VTEC inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 118 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the City's fuel economy and comfortable ride, but some criticisms include a lack of advanced safety features compared to competitors and, in some markets, a perceived lack of power, especially when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 1.5L i-VTEC engine consuming an unusually high amount of oil between service intervals. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently, low oil level warning light illuminating, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution often involves replacing the piston rings or, in severe cases, the entire engine block. Sometimes a software update can improve oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the repair and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can occur due to faulty ignition coils or spark plugs. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased fuel efficiency, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils and/or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced juddering or shuddering, especially at low speeds or during acceleration. This is often attributed to degradation of the CVT fluid or issues with the CVT belt or pulleys.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT fluid with genuine Honda CVT fluid is often the first step. In more severe cases, the CVT unit may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid replacement; $2000 - $5000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delay between shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse. Sluggish acceleration and hesitation may also occur.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service and replace the transmission fluid. Inspect and replace the valve body if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, particularly in the front control arms. This can lead to clunking noises when driving over bumps and diminished handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car battery draining prematurely, especially if the car is not driven frequently.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains, ensure the charging system is functioning correctly, and replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing loose components or adding sound dampening material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Honda City is generally a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of issues such as excessive oil consumption in the 1.5L engine and potential CVT juddering. Suspension bushing wear and electrical issues like battery drain and infotainment system problems can also occur. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs. Buyers should have a mechanic inspect the vehicle, particularly the CVT, before purchase. The costs to repair these issues vary from a couple of hundred dollars to several thousand dollars depending on the problem and if the owner takes it to a third-party mechanic or to the dealer.
