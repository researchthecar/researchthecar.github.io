The 2012 Honda City is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and practicality. In the United States, this model was not sold, however it was sold in other parts of the world. The engine options typically include a 1.3L or 1.5L i-VTEC gasoline engine. The 1.5L engine produces around 118 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options usually consist of a 5-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the City for its spacious interior, good fuel economy, and smooth ride. Common complaints often revolve around the relatively basic interior features and somewhat uninspiring driving dynamics.

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. Using a slightly thicker oil viscosity may help. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement of piston rings might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change/thicker oil) - $1500+ (engine rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, especially when the engine is cold. The idle air control valve may be dirty or malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the idle air control valve or replacing it if cleaning does not resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cleaning) - $200 (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Juddering/Jerking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT may exhibit juddering or jerking, particularly at low speeds or when accelerating from a stop. This can be caused by degradation of the CVT fluid or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT fluid with genuine Honda CVT fluid. More extensive repairs may be needed if the issue persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (CVT fluid change), $1000+ (transmission repairs or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Wear of CVT Belt**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature wear of the CVT belt, leading to transmission slippage and reduced performance. This may be more prevalent in vehicles subjected to frequent stop-and-go driving or aggressive acceleration.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking rear shock absorbers resulting in a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and potential noise from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers. Replacing both shocks at the same time is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the power window motor, causing the window to become stuck or inoperable.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may fail to lock or unlock all doors simultaneously, or may fail to respond to the key fob.
    * Solution: Check and replace the door lock actuator. Also check and replace the key fob battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5 - $25 (key fob battery), $100 - $300 (actuator parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housing, leading to reduced visibility and potential damage to the headlight assembly.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlight assembly, drying it out, and resealing it. In some cases, replacement of the headlight assembly is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (resealing), $200+ (headlight assembly replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air, indicating a potential failure of the AC compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the AC compressor, receiver drier, and potentially flushing the AC system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard, especially in hot climates.

**Summary**

The 2012 Honda City, while generally reliable, can be prone to specific issues, particularly with its CVT transmission and electrical components. Engine issues like oil consumption can also be a concern. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences like headlight condensation to more significant repairs such as transmission or engine work. Repair costs can vary widely, with some fixes being relatively inexpensive while others can be quite costly. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
