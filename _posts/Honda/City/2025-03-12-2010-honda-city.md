The 2010 Honda City, a subcompact sedan popular in Asian and Latin American markets, offered a blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and Honda reliability. Typically, it was equipped with a 1.5L i-VTEC gasoline engine, producing around 118 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the City for its spacious interior relative to its size, its fuel economy, and its comfortable ride. Common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling and lack of certain advanced features compared to competitors.
