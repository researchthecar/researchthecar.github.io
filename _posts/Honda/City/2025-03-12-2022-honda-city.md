Okay, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Honda City, categorized and formatted as requested. Note that comprehensive, verified data for a single model year like 2022 can be limited. I'll prioritize confirmed issues and widespread complaints based on available information from owner forums, reliability surveys, and repair databases.

The 2022 Honda City is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior for its class, and generally reliable reputation. Engine options typically include a 1.5L i-VTEC inline-4 gasoline engine. This engine produces around 119 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific market and tuning. Transmission options are usually a 6-speed manual or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the City's comfortable ride and practical design. Common dislikes include the relatively basic interior compared to competitors and, in some markets, limited availability of advanced driver-assistance features.

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC (L15B Series) Engine**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and occasional engine misfires. These symptoms can sometimes be attributed to faulty fuel injectors that are not delivering the correct amount of fuel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injectors. A diagnostic check is recommended to confirm the issue and identify the specific injector(s) causing the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on labor costs and number of injectors replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced jerking or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold. This may be due to programming, wear, or a minor malfunction of the CVT.
    *   Solution: A software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, a fluid change with Honda's specifically formulated CVT fluid may be necessary. In more severe cases, internal CVT damage might require a more extensive repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $200 (fluid change) - $2000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio controls, and other connected features.
    *   Solution: A software update for the infotainment system is typically the first step. If the problem persists, a hardware reset may be necessary. In rare cases, replacement of the infotainment unit might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update, often covered under warranty) - $100-$300+ (infotainment unit replacement, if not under warranty)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature battery drain, especially after short drives or periods of inactivity. This can result in difficulty starting the vehicle.
    * Solution: A parasitic draw test should be performed to identify the source of the drain. Possible causes include a faulty sensor, a module that is not shutting down properly, or a defective battery. Replace the battery if found to be faulty.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$250+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard or other interior trim pieces, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: This often requires identifying the source of the noise and securing the affected trim piece(s). This can involve adding foam padding, tightening screws, or replacing clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on complexity and if performed by a mechanic)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Honda City generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but like any vehicle, it can experience certain issues. The most commonly reported problems appear to be related to the CVT transmission and the infotainment system.  While not all owners will experience these issues, it's wise to be aware of them. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences (infotainment glitches) to potentially more costly repairs (CVT issues).  It's recommended to have a qualified mechanic perform a thorough inspection if you suspect any of these problems. The costs for fixing these problems are dependent on the specific location of the buyer.
