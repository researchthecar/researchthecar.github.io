Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2011 Honda City. This model was available with two engine options: a 1.3L i-VTEC producing around 98 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5L i-VTEC producing around 118 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. The transmissions were either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the car's fuel efficiency, spacious interior for its class, and reliability. Common dislikes include a somewhat bland styling and relatively basic features compared to some competitors.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, uneven tire wear. Rear shock absorbers can wear out prematurely.

**Summary**

The 2011 Honda City is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners do report some common issues. Engine misfires and IAC valve problems can affect performance. Harsh shifting can occur with the automatic transmission. Suspension components like rear shocks can wear out. Electrical gremlins can cause issues with power windows and central locking. Exterior issues include headlight condensation. Interior problems involve AC compressor failure and dashboard cracking/discoloration. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more costly repairs. The overall cost of ownership can be increased by addressing these potential problems proactively.
