The 2014 Honda City is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency, practicality, and spacious interior for its class. Available engine options for this year include a 1.5L i-VTEC Inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 117 hp and 107 lb-ft of torque, which is the focus for this response. Some owners appreciate the City's reliability and ease of driving, while others find the styling somewhat bland and the engine performance adequate but not exciting. Transmission options commonly paired with the 1.5L engine are a 5-speed manual and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission).

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, check engine light illuminated with misfire codes (P0300-P0304). Can be intermittent or constant.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace faulty ignition coils or spark plugs. Check for vacuum leaks or issues with the fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the number of coils/plugs and if any other underlying issues are discovered.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil level dropping rapidly between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potentially engine knocking if oil levels are critically low.
    *   Solution: In some cases, piston ring replacement may be required. Valve stem seals can also be a source of oil consumption. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the repairs needed (valve stem seals are typically less expensive than piston ring replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable juddering or shaking sensation, especially during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT fluid is often the first step. In more severe cases, CVT replacement or rebuild may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change: $100 - $300. CVT replacement/rebuild: $2000 - $4000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating, difficulty shifting gears smoothly, or erratic shifting patterns.
    *   Solution: Check and replace CVT fluid. Inspect the transmission for wear. Repair or replace the transmission if it is too damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid replacement. $2000 - $4000+ for transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn suspension bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per corner, depending on which bushings are replaced and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car battery frequently dies, especially after sitting for a short period. Difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the drain and the parts/labor required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, operating intermittently, or moving slowly.
    *   Solution: Check the power window switch, motor, and regulator. Replace faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per window, depending on the specific parts that need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlights, dry them out, and reseal them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200 for resealing, or $200-$500+ for new headlight assemblies.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air coming from the vents.
    *   Solution: Check refrigerant levels, compressor, and other AC components. Repair leaks or replace faulty parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+, depending on the severity of the issue and the parts that need replacement (e.g., recharge, compressor replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Audio System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The audio system malfunctions, stops working, or experiences connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Check the wiring and connections, reset the system, or replace the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+, depending on the nature of the issue and if replacement of the head unit is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Honda City, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most concerning issues are related to the CVT, which can lead to costly repairs or replacements. Engine problems like misfires and excessive oil consumption can also be expensive to address. Electrical issues, though less frequent, can be frustrating. Overall, while not every 2014 Honda City will experience these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of them and have the vehicle inspected before purchase, particularly paying close attention to the transmission's condition. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major transmission or engine overhauls.
