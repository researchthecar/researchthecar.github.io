**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues related to the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, which shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy. This can sometimes lead to engine vibration, rough idling, and excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include noticeable shaking at idle or while cruising at constant speeds, and the need to add oil more frequently than expected.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing VCM issues often involves inspecting the spark plugs for fouling, checking engine compression, and possibly disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices or software modifications. Addressing the root cause might require replacing faulty VCM components or performing engine repairs to address oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+, depending on the severity and the required repairs. Disabling the VCM can be done for around $150 - $300.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint centers on the 10-speed automatic transmission exhibiting harsh or jerky shifting, especially at lower speeds. Some owners also report hesitation when accelerating from a stop or when downshifting.
    *   Solution: The issue often requires a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, a complete transmission replacement may be necessary if the problem persists and is determined to be a mechanical fault.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates under warranty) - $6,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted problems with the infotainment system, including slow response times, freezing, and Bluetooth connectivity issues.

*   **Automatic Sliding Door Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported issues with the automatic sliding doors, including doors not opening or closing properly, getting stuck, or exhibiting unusual noises during operation. This might be due to sensor malfunctions, motor issues, or problems with the door tracks.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting involves checking the sensors, lubricating the tracks, and inspecting the motor. Resetting the system might also resolve minor glitches. In some cases, replacing the door motor or sensors is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on whether it's a sensor issue, motor problem, or something else.

**Summary**

The 2023 Honda Odyssey, while generally reliable, has some reported issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most concerning are related to the VCM system and transmission, which can lead to drivability problems and potentially costly repairs. Electrical issues with the infotainment and sliding doors also appear. The severity of these issues varies, and many can be addressed through software updates or component replacements, some of which may be covered under warranty. However, more extensive repairs, such as a transmission replacement, can be quite expensive. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, review its maintenance history, and consider an extended warranty to mitigate potential repair costs.
