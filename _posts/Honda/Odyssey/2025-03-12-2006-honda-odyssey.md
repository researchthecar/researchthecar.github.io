The 2006 Honda Odyssey is a popular minivan known for its reliability, spaciousness, and family-friendly features. It's powered by a 3.5L V6 engine producing 244 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While generally reliable, some common issues plague this generation Odyssey. Owners often appreciate the van's comfortable ride and abundant storage, but some common complaints include transmission problems, electrical gremlins with the power sliding doors, and issues with the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (J35A6/A7)**

* **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) System Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, misfires, spark plug fouling, rough idle, and vibration. The VCM system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy, but it can lead to these issues as the deactivated cylinders may experience oil buildup.
    * Solution: Install a VCM disabler device to prevent the system from activating, replace fouled spark plugs, and address any other resulting mechanical issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (VCM disabler) - $500+ (spark plugs, other repairs).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Cylinder Bank Oil Leak (specifically near the VTEC Solenoid)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking near the VTEC solenoid in the rear cylinder bank. This is a common leak point as the gasket ages and becomes brittle.
    * Solution: Replace the VTEC solenoid gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Motor Mount Failure**
     * Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, especially when accelerating or idling. Worn motor mounts transfer engine vibration to the chassis.
     * Solution: Replace the worn motor mounts.
     * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
     * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Failure/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or complete failure. Common issue with this transmission is wear and tear on the internal components leading to these problems.
    * Solution: Complete transmission rebuild or replacement. In some cases, a fluid change and filter replacement may temporarily alleviate symptoms.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Fluid Change) - $3000+ (Rebuild/Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during light acceleration, especially at highway speeds. Can also cause poor fuel economy and eventual transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive rear-end sag, especially when loaded. Rear shocks wear out relatively quickly on this vehicle.
    * Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Strut Mounts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noisy front suspension, clunking sounds over bumps, and vibrations in the steering wheel. Strut mounts can deteriorate over time.
    * Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors failing to open or close, making grinding noises, or requiring manual assistance. Common problems include faulty door rollers, cables, or the motor.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty rollers, cables, or motor. Check and lubricate all moving parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (DIY roller replacement) - $800+ (motor replacement and professional labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
