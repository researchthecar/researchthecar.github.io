The 2015 Honda Odyssey is a popular minivan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and practical features. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 248 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Odyssey's reliability, fuel efficiency (for a minivan), and family-friendly features like the Magic Slide second-row seats. However, some common complaints include issues with the variable cylinder management (VCM) system, potential transmission problems, and electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, engine misfires, rough idling, and vibration. The VCM system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy, but this can lead to uneven wear and tear, causing these issues.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices (VCM Tuner II), which allows all cylinders to operate continuously. Alternatively, replacing the spark plugs more frequently and using a higher-quality oil can help mitigate the problem. Some owners have had success with engine decarbonization services to clean out built-up carbon deposits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for VCM disabler, $100 - $500+ for decarbonization, $100 - $300+ for spark plug replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Failed Engine Mounts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibrations throughout the vehicle, especially at idle or low speeds. Often directly related to the VCM system exacerbating wear on the engine mounts.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed engine mounts. Upgrading to aftermarket mounts designed to withstand the vibrations caused by VCM can be a long-term solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per mount (depending on location and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds or when going uphill. Can also cause rough shifting or slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary if the problem has caused significant internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay when shifting between gears, or a harsh "clunking" sensation during shifts. Can worsen over time.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush using genuine Honda ATF DW-1 fluid. If the issue persists, it may indicate a problem with the valve body, shift solenoids, or internal wear requiring further diagnosis and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid flush, $500 - $1500+ for valve body/solenoid repair or replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncing or excessive movement in the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors failing to open or close properly, getting stuck, or making unusual noises. Can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: Check and clean the door tracks and rollers. Lubricate the moving parts. If the problem persists, the sliding door motor, cable, or control module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for cleaning and lubrication, $300 - $1000+ for motor/cable/module replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or after short periods of inactivity. Difficult starting or complete failure to start.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or a malfunctioning alternator. Replace or repair the offending component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for diagnosis, $50 - $500+ for component replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Display Screen Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Center console display screen going blank, freezing, or malfunctioning. Touchscreen not responding.
    *   Solution: Check the connections to the display screen. The display unit itself may need to be replaced or reprogrammed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for connection checks, $300 - $1000+ for display unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tailgate does not open, close, or latch properly when using the automatic button. Can make grinding or clicking noises.
    *   Solution: Check the tailgate struts, latch, and motor. Lubricate moving parts, or replace any faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rear Entertainment System (RES) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DVD player not working, screen displaying incorrectly, or system failing to power on.
    *   Solution: Check the connections, fuses, and wiring to the RES. If the issue persists, the DVD player or screen may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for basic troubleshooting, $300 - $800+ for component replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Honda Odyssey, while generally reliable, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most prevalent concern is the VCM system, which can lead to engine-related problems like excessive oil consumption and rough idling. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter failure, can also be costly to repair. Electrical problems, such as sliding door malfunctions and battery drain, can be frustrating. While the severity and cost of these issues can vary, it's advisable to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before buying a used 2015 Honda Odyssey.
