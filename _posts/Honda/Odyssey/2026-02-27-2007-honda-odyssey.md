### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Honda Odyssey is a generally dependable minivan, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of a few common issues. The Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system is a notable concern, often leading to oil consumption and engine performance problems if not addressed. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter shudder and occasional failures, are also reported. Suspension components like sway bar links and struts can wear out over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical issues such as power window failures and alternator problems are also within the realm of possibility. Regular maintenance, especially oil changes and timely timing belt replacement, is crucial for mitigating many of these potential problems.
