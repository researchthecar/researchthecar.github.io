The 2022 Honda Odyssey is a popular minivan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and family-friendly features. It is only offered with a single engine option, the 3.5L V6, producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Odyssey for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and versatile Magic Slide second-row seats. However, some common complaints include the infotainment system's complexity, the lack of a fully removable second-row seat, and, as with many modern vehicles, some electronic glitches.

**Summary**

The 2022 Honda Odyssey, while generally reliable, does have some common issues that owners should be aware of. The most concerning problems appear to be related to the engine's VCM system and the transmission's shifting behavior. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and sliding doors are also relatively common. The severity and cost of these issues can vary greatly. While some can be resolved with simple software updates or minor repairs, others may require more extensive and expensive component replacements. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, research its maintenance history, and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing or potential problems.
