**Summary**

The 2002 Honda Odyssey is a reliable minivan, but like any vehicle of its age, it's susceptible to certain issues. The most significant concerns are related to the transmission, with potential for failure that can be costly to repair. Oil leaks, timing belt maintenance, and electrical problems (especially the power sliding doors) are also common. Rust can be an issue in certain climates. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission work, can be substantial. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these issues and factor in potential repair costs.
