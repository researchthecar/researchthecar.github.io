The 2005 Honda Odyssey is a popular minivan known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It came equipped with a 3.5L V6 engine, producing 255 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised its versatility for family hauling and road trips, noting its comfortable seating and ample cargo space. Common complaints included issues with the transmission, power sliding doors, and some electrical components.
**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **VCM Misfires and Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Honda's Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to excessive oil consumption due to piston ring issues on the deactivated cylinders. Symptoms include misfires, rough idling, check engine light, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Disable the VCM system to help prevent further oil consumption. VCM disablers are aftermarket devices that plug into the OBD2 port. Replacing the piston rings is an expensive and labor-intensive repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for VCM Disabler. $3,000 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail, leading to a check engine light and potential emissions test failure. This is often linked to the VCM issues and oil entering the exhaust system.
    * Solution: Replace the catalytic converter. Address underlying engine issues, such as VCM or oil consumption, to prevent recurrence.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed automatic transmission is known for experiencing failures, particularly with the 2nd and 3rd gears. Symptoms include slipping, hard shifting, and complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Complete transmission replacement or rebuild. Regular fluid changes with Honda Genuine ATF can help prolong the transmission's life, but it cannot prevent failures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for replacement. $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild.
    * Recalls:
        * 04V553000 (Recall Date: 2004-11-12) - Certain Honda and Acura models were recalled because the automatic transmission secondary shaft bearing was not properly heat treated and could fail. This could cause the transmission to lock up, increasing the risk of a crash. Remedy: Dealers will replace the automatic transmission secondary shaft bearing free of charge.
        * 05V041000 (Recall Date: 2005-02-03) - Certain Honda and Acura models were recalled because the automatic transmission second gear could break under high stress conditions, leading to transmission failure. This could cause the transmission to lock up, increasing the risk of a crash. Remedy: Dealers will replace the automatic transmission second gear free of charge.

**Suspension**

* **Rear Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, especially when carrying heavy loads. This is due to worn-out shocks and springs.
    * Solution: Replace the rear shocks and springs. Air suspension upgrades can provide better load leveling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Sliding Door Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors are prone to failure. Symptoms include the doors not opening or closing properly, getting stuck, or making unusual noises. The problem is often caused by a worn-out cable, motor, or latch assembly.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty cable, motor, or latch assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per door.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Tailgate Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power tailgate may malfunction and fail to open or close properly, requiring manual assistance.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty tailgate motor, latch, or struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Driver’s side window switch failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The driver’s side power window switch can stop working which can affect all the windows in the vehicle.
    * Solution: Replace the switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop, particularly around the rear wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage, especially in areas with salt exposure.

**Summary**

The 2005 Honda Odyssey is a generally reliable minivan, but the 5-speed transmission issues, VCM-related oil consumption, and power sliding door problems can be significant concerns. Transmission failure can be costly to repair, and the VCM issue can lead to engine damage if not addressed. While less severe, electrical issues with the sliding doors can be a common annoyance. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
