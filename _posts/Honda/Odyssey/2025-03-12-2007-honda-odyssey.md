The 2007 Honda Odyssey is a popular minivan known for its practicality, reliability, and spacious interior. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 244 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Odyssey's smooth ride, ample cargo space, and comfortable seating. However, some common complaints include issues with the variable cylinder management (VCM) system, sliding door malfunctions, and transmission problems, leading to frustration and unexpected repair costs.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (J35A7)**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VCM system is designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders during light load conditions. However, it can lead to excessive oil consumption, fouled spark plugs (especially in cylinders 1-4), engine misfires, and vibrations, particularly when the system engages or disengages. Some owners also report a "shuddering" sensation.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using an aftermarket VCM disabler device (e.g., VCMTuner, S-VCM Controller). Replacing spark plugs more frequently, and in severe cases, decarbonizing the piston rings may help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: VCM disabler devices: $100 - $200. Spark plug replacement: $100 - $300. Decarbonizing/Piston Ring Replacement: $500 - $2000+ (depending on severity and shop).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Bank (1-3) Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to excessive oil consumption and running rich, the rear bank catalytic converter will often fail. This will often present with a check engine light code (P0420)
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear bank catalytic converter will fix the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1000+ depending on OEM or aftermarket part

**Summary**

The 2007 Honda Odyssey can be a reliable and practical vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the VCM system, transmission, sliding doors, and potential for rust. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive solutions like VCM disablers, others, such as transmission failure or rust repair, can be costly. Inspecting a used Odyssey thoroughly and checking its maintenance history are essential steps before purchasing.
