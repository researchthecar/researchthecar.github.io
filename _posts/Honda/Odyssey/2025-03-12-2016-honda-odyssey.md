The 2016 Honda Odyssey is a popular minivan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and family-friendly features. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 248 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

Common praises include its versatility, smooth engine, and quiet cabin, while common complaints involve the infotainment system, some reliability concerns, and the overall cost of ownership and repairs.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (J35A1 Engine)**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, fouled spark plugs, engine misfires, and rough idling, often attributed to the VCM system which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Disable VCM using aftermarket devices like a VCM Tuner II or install a muzzler, or replace faulty VCM components. Some have seen improvement with piston ring replacement, though this is a more extensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for a VCM disabler; $500 - $2,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle on Startup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold startup lasting for a few seconds. This is related to the Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator, which is responsible for adjusting camshaft timing.
    *   Solution: Replace the VTC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration, especially at low speeds and during light acceleration. This can be caused by deteriorated transmission fluid or a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Perform a drain and fill of the transmission fluid using genuine Honda ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid). If the issue persists, torque converter replacement may be necessary. A software update may also be available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid change; $800 - $1,500+ for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor ride quality, and clunking noises from the rear suspension. Leaking fluid from the shock absorbers may also be visible.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per pair, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors failing to open or close properly, or making unusual noises. This can be caused by a faulty actuator motor or damaged wiring.
