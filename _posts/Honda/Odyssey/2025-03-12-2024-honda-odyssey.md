The 2024 Honda Odyssey is a minivan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and family-friendly features. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Odyssey's practicality, smooth driving experience, and advanced safety technology.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Timing Control (VTC) Actuator Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start, especially in colder temperatures. This is caused by the VTC actuator not properly locking during startup.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VTC actuator with an updated version. A software update may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission shifts roughly between gears, or experiences a delay before engaging a gear. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds or during cold starts.
    *   Solution: This can be caused by a faulty shift solenoid, low transmission fluid, or a valve body issue. Start with a transmission fluid change and software update for the transmission control module. If the problem persists, the valve body might need to be replaced or rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for fluid change and software update; $800 - $2000+ for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or reboots unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions controlled through the system.
    *   Solution: Start with a system reset (consult the owner's manual). If the problem continues, a software update from the dealer is needed. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit itself might require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for reset; $0-$150 for software update from dealer; $500 - $1500+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sliding Door Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors may fail to open or close properly, or make unusual noises during operation. This could be due to a faulty motor, sensor, or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause using diagnostic tools. Potential solutions include replacing the motor, sensor, wiring harness, or adjusting the door alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rear Entertainment System (RES) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, glitching, no audio, or the screen doesn't turn on.
    *   Solution: Could be a software issue, or a hardware issue with the screen. Could require software updates from the dealer. In severe cases the unit might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update; $500-$1500+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tailgate won't open or close. May get stuck halfway. Could be a problem with the actuator, the wiring, or the button that initiates the open or closing of the tailgate.
    *   Solution: Replace broken actuator, inspect wiring, or replace the button.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Honda Odyssey, while generally reliable, can experience some issues related to its engine, transmission, electrical systems, interior features, and exterior components. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences like infotainment glitches to more significant problems like transmission shifting problems.
