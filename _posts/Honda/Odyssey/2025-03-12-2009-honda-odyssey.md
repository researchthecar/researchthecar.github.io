The 2009 Honda Odyssey is a minivan known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It offered seating for up to eight passengers and was a popular choice for families. The 2009 Odyssey was equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 244 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciated the Odyssey's practicality and smooth ride, some common complaints included issues with the variable cylinder management (VCM) system, sliding door malfunctions, and certain electrical glitches. The Odyssey was praised for its versatility, fuel efficiency for its class, and family-friendly features, but some owners noted that the VCM system could cause engine vibrations and that repair costs could be higher than average.
