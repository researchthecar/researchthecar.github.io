* **2.4-liter 4-cylinder (175 hp)**
    * **No Issues Found**
* **3.5-liter V6 (280 hp)**
    * **Spark Plug Fouling:** The spark plugs may foul prematurely, causing misfires, rough idling, and reduced power. Repair involves replacing the spark plugs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    * **Intake Valve Carbon Buildup:** Carbon buildup on the intake valves can restrict airflow, causing decreased engine performance. Repair involves removing the intake manifold and cleaning the valves. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+

**Transmission**

* **5-speed Automatic**
    * **Transmission Slippage:** The transmission may slip or hesitate during gear changes, especially when under load. The issue is commonly caused by worn or damaged clutch packs or bands. Repair involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * **Torque Converter Shudder:** The torque converter may shudder during acceleration or when the vehicle is cruising at highway speeds. The issue is typically caused by a faulty torque converter or lockup clutch. Repair involves replacing the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
* **4-speed Automatic**
    * **No Issues Found**
* **6-speed Automatic**
    * **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Failure:** The TCM, which controls the transmission, may fail and cause the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. Repair involves replacing the TCM. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**Suspension**

* **Lower Ball Joint Failure:** The lower ball joints, which connect the control arms to the steering knuckles, may wear out prematurely. Symptoms include clunking or rattling noises when driving over bumps, uneven tire wear, and reduced steering stability. Repair involves replacing the ball joints. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Rear Sway Bar Link Failure:** The rear sway bar links, which connect the sway bar to the suspension, may fail. This can cause excessive body roll and poor handling. Repair involves replacing the sway bar links. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
* **Front Strut Noise:** The front struts may develop a knocking or clunking noise over bumps. The issue is typically caused by worn or damaged strut mounts. Repair involves replacing the strut mounts or the entire strut assembly. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery may drain prematurely, even when the vehicle is not in use. The issue can be caused by a parasitic draw from electrical components, such as a faulty alternator or starter. Repair involves identifying and repairing the source of the drain. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail, causing the battery to not charge properly. Symptoms include dimming headlights, flickering dashboard lights, and difficulty starting the vehicle. Repair involves replacing the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
* **Starter Failure:** The starter may fail, preventing the engine from starting. Symptoms include a clicking noise when trying to start the vehicle or no response at all. Repair involves replacing the starter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
* **Wiper Motor Failure:** The wiper motor may fail, causing the wipers to stop working or operate intermittently. Repair involves replacing the wiper motor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
* **Power Window Failure:** One or more power windows may fail to operate or operate slowly. The issue can be caused by a faulty switch, motor, or wiring. Repair involves diagnosing and replacing the affected component. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
