The 2004 Honda Odyssey is a popular minivan known for its reliability, practicality, and spacious interior. It's powered by a 3.5L V6 engine, producing 240 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its comfortable ride, versatile seating configurations, and overall dependability. However, common complaints include transmission problems, sliding door malfunctions, and issues with the air conditioning system. While praised for its longevity, some specific components are prone to failure at higher mileage.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, designed to improve fuel economy, can cause excessive oil consumption leading to fouled spark plugs and engine misfires, particularly in cylinders 1-4 on the front bank. Symptoms include a rough idle, check engine light, and poor acceleration.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system with an aftermarket VCM disabler device. Replacing the fouled spark plugs and cleaning the piston rings can also help. Upgrading the PCV valve to a higher-flow version may mitigate the oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100 for a VCM disabler, $100 - $300+ for spark plug replacement and cleaning.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Degrading catalytic converters are common as the vehicle ages. This often stems from oil consumption issues. Symptoms include a check engine light (often with codes P0420 or P0430), reduced fuel economy, and a sulfur-like smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter(s). Ensure underlying engine issues like oil consumption are addressed to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the converter and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Failure/Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue is premature transmission failure, especially with a lack of regular maintenance. Symptoms include slipping gears, harsh shifting, failure to shift, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Regular transmission fluid changes can prolong its life. If problems arise, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary. Installing an external transmission cooler may also help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid changes, $2500 - $4500+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter shudder, particularly at low speeds or during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Perform multiple drain-and-fills of the transmission fluid with genuine Honda ATF-Z1 (or DW-1 after its discontinuation). If the problem persists, a torque converter replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid changes, $500 - $1500+ for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Sagging Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, especially when carrying heavy loads. This is often due to worn-out rear springs or shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear springs and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the components used and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn-Out Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The various bushings in the suspension system (control arms, sway bar links, etc.) can wear out, leading to clunking noises, imprecise handling, and vibrations.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn-out bushings. In some cases, replacing the entire control arm is more cost-effective than pressing in new bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per bushing/component, depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors are prone to failure, either refusing to open/close or becoming difficult to operate. This can be due to motor failure, worn rollers, or cable issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause (motor, rollers, cables) and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the component and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power window regulators can fail, causing the window to get stuck or operate erratically.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear wheel arches are prone to rust, especially in areas with road salt.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the rusted panels. Preventing rust requires regular cleaning and rustproofing treatments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per panel depending on severity and body shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning systems often develop leaks, leading to reduced cooling performance. Common leak points include the condenser, evaporator, and hoses. The rear AC system can also be problematic.
    *   Solution: Locating and repairing the leak, replacing faulty components, and recharging the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the severity of the leak and the parts involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Honda Odyssey is generally a reliable vehicle, but certain issues are prevalent. The most significant are transmission problems and engine issues stemming from the VCM system. These repairs can be costly, ranging from hundreds to several thousands of dollars. Addressing these issues proactively with regular maintenance can mitigate their impact and extend the lifespan of the vehicle. Other common problems, such as sliding door malfunctions and suspension wear, can also contribute to the overall cost of ownership.
