**Introduction:**

The 1997 Honda Civic del Sol was a sporty and compact convertible available in two trims: the base model and the Si.

The Si trim featured a more powerful 1.6-liter DOHC VTEC engine with 127 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. The del Sol was praised for its agile handling, responsive engines, and stylish design. However, it was criticized for its limited cargo space and cramped interior.
