**Summary**

The 1993 Honda Civic del Sol is generally a reliable car, but it can experience some issues. The most common issues are related to the engine (head gasket failure, timing belt tensioner failure), transmission (shifter linkage wear, transmission fluid leak), suspension (front struts wear), electrical (alternator failure, starter motor failure), exterior (sunroof seal failure), and interior (dashboard cracking, door handle breakage). While some of these issues can be costly to repair, many are relatively minor and can be fixed at a reasonable cost.
