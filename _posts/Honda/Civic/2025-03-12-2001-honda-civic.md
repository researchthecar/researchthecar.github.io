The 2001 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Two primary engine options were available: a 1.7L Inline-4 SOHC engine, producing around 115-127 horsepower and 103-114 lb-ft of torque depending on the trim level, and a 1.7L VTEC engine with an output of 127 horsepower. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Civic's longevity, fuel economy, and ease of maintenance. Common complaints often revolve around its relatively basic features, road noise, and age-related wear and tear, given the model year.

**Summary**

The 2001 Honda Civic, while generally reliable, exhibits several age-related issues. Engine problems include catalytic converter failure, engine mount failure, and oil leaks, which can lead to moderate repair costs. Automatic transmission issues like slipping and harsh shifting are significant concerns, potentially requiring expensive rebuilds or replacements. Suspension wear, electrical problems, and interior degradation are also common. Rust is a significant concern for the exterior. Overall, while many of these issues are manageable with regular maintenance and timely repairs, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchase considerations. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly depending on the vehicle's condition and location.
