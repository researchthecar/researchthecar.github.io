The 2021 Honda Civic marked the end of the tenth generation and was available as a sedan, hatchback, or coupe (though the coupe was discontinued after 2020). Two engine options were offered: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 174-180 horsepower and 162-177 lb-ft of torque depending on the trim level. Both engines were primarily paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), though a 6-speed manual was available on some trims of the hatchback. Owners generally praised the Civic for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and comfortable ride. Common complaints centered around the infotainment system's complexity and the CVT's drone-like sound during acceleration.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4 (K20C2)**

No Issues Found

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4 (L15BA/L15BD)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This was especially noticeable in earlier production models. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, the need to add oil frequently, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    * Solution: A revised piston ring design was implemented in later production models, and a software update was released by Honda to adjust the oil level monitoring system. For affected vehicles, dealers may perform an oil consumption test and, if deemed excessive, replace the piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of damage and required repairs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported experiencing jerking or hesitation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can manifest as a slight shudder or a more pronounced lurch when transitioning between speeds.
    * Solution: A software update to the CVT control module was sometimes successful. In more severe cases, a CVT fluid change or even a replacement of the CVT unit itself was necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 for software update, $100-300 for fluid change, $3,000 - $6,000+ for CVT replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Whining Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining noise emanating from the transmission area, particularly during acceleration. This noise can increase in pitch and volume as the vehicle's speed increases.
    * Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change may alleviate the noise, but a more permanent solution often involves replacing the CVT.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid change, $3,000 - $6,000+ for CVT replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes entirely. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions integrated into the system.
    * Solution: A software update from Honda could address the issue. If the issue persists, a replacement of the infotainment unit itself may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update, $500 - $1500+ for infotainment unit replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners reported instances of the car's battery draining unexpectedly, especially after being parked for a relatively short period. This could lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    * Solution: The dealership would perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Potential causes include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a defective battery. Replacement of the battery or faulty module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for battery replacement, $100 - $500+ for diagnostic testing and module replacement depending on what is found.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Rattling/Creaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling or creaking noise originating from the sunroof area, particularly when driving over uneven surfaces or at higher speeds.
    * Solution: Tightening the sunroof components, lubricating the seals, or replacing worn parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the source and extent of the rattling.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Honda Civic generally enjoys a good reputation for reliability, but like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. The most concerning problems relate to potential excessive oil consumption in the 1.5L Turbo engine and the CVT transmission exhibiting jerking or whining noises. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain also surface. While many of these issues can be addressed with software updates or minor repairs, some may require more costly component replacements, making it advisable for potential buyers to thoroughly inspect the vehicle and review its maintenance history.
