The 2012 Honda Civic marked the beginning of the ninth generation of this popular compact car. It was available with a 1.8-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 140 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. A natural gas powered version was also available, as well as a Civic Si with a 2.4-liter inline-4. The standard transmission was a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic (depending on the trim). People generally appreciated the Civic's fuel efficiency, reliability, and affordability. Common complaints focused on the redesigned styling (especially initially), ride quality (some found it harsh), and interior materials.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline-4 (R18Z1)**

*   **Engine Block Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported engine block cracking, leading to coolant leaks and potential engine failure. Overheating is a common symptom. This appears to be a less widespread issue but can be catastrophic.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement or block repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2012 Civics, particularly those with higher mileage, experience excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or potentially the entire engine. A temporary fix can be to use a higher-viscosity oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4 (K24Z7) - Civic Si**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Difficulty shifting, slipping, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. In some cases, a full transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary if the damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on repair scope)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the front struts can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and unusual noises (clunking) over bumps.
    *   Solution: Strut replacement (both front struts are usually recommended to be replaced as a set).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially overnight or when the car sits unused for a few days. This can result in difficulty starting or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic drain (e.g., faulty relay, aftermarket accessory). Replacing the battery is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Honda Civic, while generally reliable, has some common issues to watch out for. The most significant concerns revolve around the 1.8L engine, specifically potential engine block cracking and excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, also warrant attention. Other problems like suspension wear, electrical glitches, and interior cosmetic issues are less severe but still impact the ownership experience. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and check its maintenance history, paying close attention to any signs of these common issues.
