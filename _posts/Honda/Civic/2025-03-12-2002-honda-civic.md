The 2002 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. It was available with two primary engine options: a 1.7L SOHC 4-cylinder engine in various trims (D17A1, D17A2, D17A6, D17A7, D17A8) and a 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine in the Si trim (K20A3). The 1.7L engine produced around 115-127 horsepower and 105-114 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific variant. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Civic for its fuel economy, dependability, and ease of maintenance. Common dislikes include the relatively bland styling (compared to earlier Civics), potential for rust in some regions, and the base engine's lack of power for some drivers.
