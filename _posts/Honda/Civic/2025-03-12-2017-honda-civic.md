The 2017 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and comfortable ride. It was available with two main engine options: a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 174 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque (in most trims, the EX-T trim received an additional 6 lb-ft of torque making it 174 hp and 162 lb-ft). Both engines were available with either a 6-speed manual transmission (on certain trims with the 2.0L engine) or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Civic for its spacious interior, responsive handling, and good fuel economy. Common complaints include the infotainment system's complexity and potential issues with the CVT transmission in certain models.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, check engine light illumination. Often caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils and/or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel odor in the oil, rising oil level on the dipstick, and potential engine damage in cold climates due to incomplete combustion and fuel mixing with the oil. This issue was more prevalent in colder regions.
    *   Solution: Honda issued a software update (ECU recalibration) to address the fuel-injection strategy. Some owners also opted for more frequent oil changes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update was typically performed free of charge under a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB). Oil change cost varies ($50 - $100).
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine bay, loss of power, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or jerky movements during acceleration, especially from a stop or at low speeds. Shuddering can also occur.
    *   Solution: Software updates were sometimes effective. In more severe cases, CVT replacement or rebuild was required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update typically covered under warranty or TSB. CVT replacement: $3000 - $5000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or restarts randomly. This issue was more common in earlier production models.
    *   Solution: Software updates helped mitigate the issue. Some owners also had to replace the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update typically covered under warranty. Head unit replacement: $500 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for a few days.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to find the parasitic draw (a component constantly drawing power). Culprits can include aftermarket accessories, a faulty relay, or a failing component in the car's electrical system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ (depending on the source of the draw and labor involved in diagnosis).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard (Certain Regions)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or warping of the dashboard, especially in regions with high heat and sunlight exposure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Honda Civic is generally a reliable car, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Oil dilution in the 1.5L turbo engine can be a concern, especially in colder climates, but the ECU recalibration helped to alleviate the problem. CVT issues are another area to watch out for. Infotainment problems and dashboard cracking (in certain regions) are also possibilities. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive software updates to more substantial expenses like CVT or turbocharger replacement. While no recalls were found for the specified issues, it's always best to check the NHTSA website for the latest recall information.
