The 2005 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It was offered in various trim levels, including DX, VP, LX, EX, and Si. The most common engine was the 1.7L inline-4, available in SOHC and VTEC configurations, producing around 115-127 horsepower and 105-114 lb-ft of torque, depending on the trim and configuration. A 5-speed manual transmission was standard on many trims, with a 4-speed automatic transmission available as an option. The Civic Si featured a more powerful 2.0L i-VTEC engine. Owners often appreciate the Civic's fuel economy, longevity, and ease of maintenance. However, common complaints include some issues with the automatic transmission, potential engine problems in higher mileage examples, and some wear and tear with age.
