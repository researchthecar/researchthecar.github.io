The 2000 Honda Civic is a compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and affordability. This model year came with several engine and transmission options, the most common being the 1.6L SOHC 4-cylinder engine available in a range of trims, including DX, LX, and EX. The 1.6L SOHC engine produced around 106-127 horsepower and 103-114 lb-ft of torque, depending on the trim and VTEC configuration. Available transmissions included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. People generally liked the Civic for its practicality, fuel economy, and ease of maintenance. Common dislikes include its relatively basic interior and limited power, especially in non-VTEC models.

**Engine**

**1.6L SOHC 4-Cylinder (D16Y7, D16Y8, D16Y5)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and distributor O-ring. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and O-ring. Ensure proper tightening torque during reinstallation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Distributor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The distributor, particularly in higher-mileage vehicles, can experience failure of the internal components. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, difficulty starting, and a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replace the entire distributor assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Carbon buildup in the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve can cause it to stick open or closed. This can result in rough idling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light (CEL) with codes related to EGR flow.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. In some cases, the EGR ports in the intake manifold may also need to be cleaned.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $250+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shift Problems/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting between gears, slipping during acceleration, and harsh or delayed shifts are common issues. These can be caused by worn clutches, low fluid levels, or a faulty shift solenoid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and replace the filter. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required, potentially leading to a rebuild or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $2000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bushings in the suspension components (control arms, sway bar, etc.) degrade over time, leading to excessive play, clunking noises, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings. Depending on the severity, entire control arms may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid, bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll indicate worn shocks or struts.
    *   Solution: Replace the shocks and/or struts. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear) for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows to operate, often due to a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component failure (motor, regulator, switch) and replace the faulty part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $250+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, a dead battery, and a battery warning light on the dashboard indicate a failing alternator.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Corroded Grounds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as erratic gauge readings, malfunctioning lights, and starting issues can arise from corroded ground connections.
    *   Solution: Clean and re-secure all ground connections throughout the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $25 - $100+ (depending on labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, particularly in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure such as rear wheel wells, rocker panels, and lower door edges.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Address the source of the moisture/corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking and splitting of the dashboard plastic due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $800+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Door Handles (Interior)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Interior door handles may break due to wear and tear, rendering the door difficult or impossible to open from the inside.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken door handle assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $25 - $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Honda Civic, while generally reliable, can suffer from several common issues as it ages. Engine problems like oil leaks and distributor failures, as well as transmission problems, can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension and electrical issues can also impact the driving experience and safety. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to address, others, like transmission rebuilds or rust repair, can be quite costly. Pre-purchase inspections are essential to identify potential problems and negotiate a fair price.
