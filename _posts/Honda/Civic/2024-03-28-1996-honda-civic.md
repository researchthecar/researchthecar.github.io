**1996 Honda Civic**

The 1996 Honda Civic is a compact car that was available in sedan, coupe, and hatchback body styles. It was powered by a 1.6-liter SOHC engine that produced 106 horsepower and 103 lb-ft of torque. The Civic was also available with a 1.6-liter DOHC VTEC engine that produced 127 horsepower and 109 lb-ft of torque.
