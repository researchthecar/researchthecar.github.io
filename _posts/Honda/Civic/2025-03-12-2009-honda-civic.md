**Summary**

The 2009 Honda Civic is generally a reliable vehicle. The most significant issues reported are the cracked engine block with the 1.8L I4, which can be very expensive to repair, and the harsh shifting with the 5-speed automatic transmission which might require expensive repairs if a fluid change does not resolve the issue. Other common issues include rear suspension sag, electrical problems, and interior cracking, but are less severe. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the engine for any signs of coolant leaks or overheating, and check the transmission for smooth shifting, especially for vehicles with the 1.8L I4 and 5-speed automatic transmission.
