The 2016 Honda Civic marked a significant redesign for the model, moving to its tenth generation. While generally well-received for its fuel efficiency, updated styling, and improved handling, some owners have reported various issues. The 2016 Civic was offered with two main engine options: a 2.0L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 generating 174 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque (in most trims). Both engines were available with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), while the 2.0L engine could also be paired with a 6-speed manual transmission in the LX trim. People like the Civic for its reliability, fuel economy, and modern interior, but some dislike the CVT's driving feel and the infotainment system's complexity.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported instances of engine misfires, particularly at higher mileage. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating. Faulty ignition coils or spark plugs are commonly the cause.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils and/or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A significant issue reported by many 1.5L turbo engine owners is fuel dilution of the engine oil. This happens when uncombusted fuel leaks past the piston rings and contaminates the oil. Symptoms include a strong fuel smell in the engine oil, rising oil levels, and potential engine damage over time.
    *   Solution: Honda issued a software update (TSB 17-030) to recalibrate the ECU and optimize fuel injection to reduce fuel dilution. In some cases, a short block replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically covered under warranty. Short block replacement can cost $3,000 - $5,000+.
    *   Recalls: Recall Number 18V732000 (Fuel dilution)

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a loss of power, whining or screeching noises from the engine, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Shuddering/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is a noticeable shudder or jerky sensation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be due to wear in the CVT's belt or internal components, or software issues.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically covered under warranty or may cost $100-$200. CVT replacement can cost $3,000 - $5,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature transmission failure. Symptoms include slipping, the inability to accelerate, and loud noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a clunking or rattling noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps. This can be caused by worn rear shock absorbers or loose suspension components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn shock absorbers and tightening any loose suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system has been a source of complaints, with owners reporting slow response times, freezing, and Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In some cases, replacing the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty or are free. Head unit replacement can cost $500 - $1,500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car battery draining prematurely, especially if the car is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery with a higher-quality one, ensuring all electrical accessories are turned off when the car is not in use, and checking for parasitic draws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Cracked Windshield**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported windshield cracking with no apparent impact.
    *   Solution: Windshield replacement.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Honda Civic, while generally a reliable vehicle, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant problems relate to the 1.5L turbocharged engine, specifically oil dilution, and the CVT, which can experience shuddering or failure. Electrical issues with the infotainment system are also a common complaint. The severity and cost of repairs can vary, but addressing these issues promptly can prevent more extensive damage. The fuel dilution issues are the most concerning, due to their potential to damage the engine over time and the high cost of a potential engine replacement.
