The 2008 Honda Civic is a compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It came in sedan and coupe body styles. Engine options included a 1.8L Inline-4 (140 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.0L Inline-4 (197 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque) for the Si model. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic (standard on the 1.8L, optional on the Si).
