**Summary**

The 2004 Honda Civic is generally reliable, but age-related issues are common. Engine problems like cracked engine blocks and catalytic converter failure can be expensive. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic and CVT transmissions, can also be costly. Suspension components like trailing arm bushings and struts wear out over time. Electrical problems with power windows and the ignition switch can occur. Rust, especially on the rear wheel arches, is a common issue. Dashboard cracks are a common interior complaint. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like engine or transmission replacements, can be quite costly. Overall, the 2004 Civic can be a good value, but potential buyers should carefully inspect the car for these common problems.
