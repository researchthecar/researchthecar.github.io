The 2020 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and sporty handling, especially in the Si and Type R trims. Engine options for the 2020 Civic include a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 174-205 horsepower (depending on trim) and 162-192 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 6-speed manual (available on some trims) and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Civic for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. Common complaints often revolve around road noise and the CVT's performance, which some find less engaging than a traditional automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil more often than expected.
    * Solution: In some cases, Honda dealers may perform an oil consumption test to determine the extent of the issue. If the consumption is deemed excessive, potential solutions may include replacing piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

* **Fuel Dilution**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported fuel dilution, where unburnt gasoline mixes with the engine oil. This can lead to a gasoline smell in the oil, increased oil level, and potential engine damage over time. The issue seems more prevalent in colder climates with short trips.
    * Solution: Honda issued a software update (ECU reflash) to address this issue in some affected vehicles. In severe cases, oil changes and engine flushing might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for ECU reflash, if not covered under warranty); $50 - $150 for oil change.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerky acceleration, hesitation, or a lack of responsiveness, particularly at lower speeds. This can manifest as a "rubber band" feeling during acceleration.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update (TCU reflash) can improve the CVT's behavior. In other cases, replacement of the CVT may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for TCU reflash, if not covered under warranty); $4,000 - $8,000 for CVT replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CVT judder and shuddering**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a distinct shaking and juddering when accelerating from low speed or when the transmission is under light load.
    * Solution: A fluid change may fix the issue. If not, the CVT may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for fluid change, if not covered under warranty); $4,000 - $8,000 for CVT replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Performing a software update of the infotainment system might solve the issue. If not, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update, if not covered under warranty); $500 - $1,500+ for head unit replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Backup Camera Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The backup camera can fail to display an image, show a distorted image, or intermittently cut out.
    * Solution: Check the wiring connections to the camera. If the wiring is good, the backup camera may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Cracking Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight. This is a cosmetic issue but can be unsightly.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Honda Civic is generally a reliable vehicle. However, some owners have reported issues with excessive oil consumption, fuel dilution (in the 1.5L turbo), and CVT performance. The infotainment system and backup camera can also have issues. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Some can be addressed with software updates or minor repairs, while others may require more extensive and costly repairs like engine or transmission replacements.
