The 2015 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. Engine options include a 1.8-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 143 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 174 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque (Si model). The 1.8L engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual or a CVT transmission, while the 2.4L engine is paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciate the Civic's comfortable ride, spacious interior (for its class), and excellent fuel economy. Common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired styling (depending on personal preference) and the road noise, particularly on certain tire choices.
