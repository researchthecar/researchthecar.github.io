Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2023 Honda Civic, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2023 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and sporty handling. Available in sedan and hatchback forms, it offers a comfortable ride and a well-designed interior. Engine options include a 2.0L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque and a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 generating 180 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), although a 6-speed manual transmission is available on the hatchback with the 1.5L turbo engine. Some common dislikes include road noise and a somewhat plain interior design, despite its functionality.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, and visible blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    *   Solution: There is no permanent fix for this issue, however, monitoring oil levels more closely, or switching to a different oil type may reduce consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**
*   **Fuel Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported fuel dilution in the oil, where unburnt fuel mixes with the engine oil. This can lead to premature engine wear. Symptoms include a strong gasoline smell in the oil and rising oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Honda has released updated ECU software to address this issue, however it isn't a permanent fix. Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil are recommended to mitigate the effects of fuel dilution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) - Both Engine Options**
*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerky acceleration or hesitation, particularly at low speeds or when accelerating from a stop. This can be more pronounced in cold weather.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT software update from the dealership may improve the transmission's behavior. For more severe cases, a transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $4,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, lags, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio controls, and other features.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset may temporarily resolve the issue. Honda may also release software updates to address infotainment system bugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (System Reset) - Dealership Diagnostic Fee if a software update is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the backup camera, including a distorted or black screen, or the camera failing to activate when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring for damage. If the issue persists, the camera unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Door Seals**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the door seals are not properly aligned, and the wind noise in the vehicle is louder than normal.
    *   Solution: Reseat the door seal or replace the door seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises coming from the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck area. These noises are often more noticeable on rough roads.
    *   Solution: The source of the rattle needs to be identified and secured. This may involve adding foam padding or tightening loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY Fix) - $100 - $300+ (Dealership Diagnostic and Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Honda Civic, while generally reliable, experiences some issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and fuel dilution, particularly with the turbocharged engine, can lead to potential long-term concerns. Transmission quirks with the CVT and electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera can be frustrating. Interior rattles can detract from the overall driving experience. While some issues can be addressed with software updates or minor repairs, others may require more costly fixes. The severity of these issues varies, with some owners experiencing minimal problems while others face more significant repairs.
