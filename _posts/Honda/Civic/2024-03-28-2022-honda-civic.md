**Introduction:** The 2022 Honda Civic is a compact sedan that offers a blend of performance, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It is available with three engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder, a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder, and a hybrid powertrain. Transmission options include a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for the naturally aspirated engine and a six-speed manual or CVT for the turbocharged engine. The hybrid model features an electronic continuously variable transmission (e-CVT). Owners appreciate the Civic's reliability, fuel efficiency, and technology features but have reported some issues with certain components.

**Engine**
* **2.0-Liter Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**
