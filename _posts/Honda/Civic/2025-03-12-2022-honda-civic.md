**Summary**

The 2022 Honda Civic, while generally reliable, has a few common issues. Engine concerns such as misfires in the 2.0L and fuel dilution in the 1.5L turbo can be addressed with repairs ranging from $100 to $400+, or potentially a free software update. The CVT transmission may exhibit hesitation, addressed with fluid changes ($150-$300+), and electrical glitches in the infotainment system require troubleshooting and potential head unit replacement, costing upwards of $500.
