The 2007 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its fuel efficiency and reliability. It comes with a few different engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 1.8L SOHC i-VTEC inline-4 engine producing 140 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful option is the 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC inline-4 found in the Civic Si, which delivers 197 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic (for the 1.8L engine), and a 6-speed manual (for the 2.0L Civic Si). Owners appreciate the Civic's fuel economy, comfortable ride, and reputation for longevity. However, some common complaints include issues with cracking engine blocks, excessive road noise, and premature wear of certain interior components.

**Summary**

The 2007 Honda Civic, while generally reliable, has some notable issues. The most concerning is the potential for engine block cracking in the 1.8L engine, a potentially expensive repair. Other issues such as transmission problems and clear coat failure can also add to the cost of ownership. While the Civic Si is not completely without issues, it has proven to be more reliable compared to the 1.8L models. Prior to purchasing, it is recommended to inspect the vehicle thoroughly for these common problems.
