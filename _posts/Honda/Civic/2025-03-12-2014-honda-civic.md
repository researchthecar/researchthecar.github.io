The 2014 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It was available as a sedan and a coupe. The base engine is a 1.8-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 143 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). A natural gas version was available as well, rated at 110 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque with only an automatic transmission option. Drivers generally appreciate the Civic's comfortable ride, spacious interior for its class, and good fuel economy. However, some criticisms include its somewhat bland styling and a perceived lack of excitement compared to some competitors.

The 2014 Honda Civic generally exhibits the reliability Honda is known for, but owners do experience some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission, especially juddering and potential failure, which can be costly to repair. Electrical problems such as battery drain and display screen malfunctions also occur. While engine issues like misfires and catalytic converter failure are not uncommon, they are generally less severe than transmission problems. Interior issues such as cracked dashboards and A/C problems can also impact the ownership experience. Overall, when considering a 2014 Civic, potential buyers should pay close attention to the condition of the CVT transmission and be prepared for potential electrical and interior repairs.
