The 2019 Honda Civic is a popular compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and sporty handling, particularly in the Si and Type R trims. It generally receives positive reviews for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. However, some common complaints include the infotainment system's complexity and the road noise that can be present in certain trims. Engine options for the 2019 Civic include a 2.0L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 158 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 174-205 horsepower (depending on trim) and 162-192 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 6-speed manual (available only on certain trims/engines) and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT).

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel mixes with the engine oil, leading to a higher-than-normal oil level and a gasoline smell in the oil. This can cause premature engine wear. Occurs more frequently in colder climates and during short trips where the engine doesn't fully warm up.
    *   Solution: Honda issued a software update (ECU reflash) to improve engine management and combustion to reduce fuel dilution. In some cases, an oil change may be needed to remove the contaminated oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: The ECU reflash was typically covered under warranty. Oil change costs vary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises, loss of power, or turbocharger failure. Can be caused by oil starvation or debris entering the turbo.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Ensure proper oil change intervals using the correct oil type to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200-$2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Juddering/Shaking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shaking or juddering sensation, especially when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This is often described as feeling like the transmission is slipping.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with a CVT fluid change using genuine Honda CVT fluid. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be replaced. A software update may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT Fluid Change: $150-$300, CVT Replacement: $3000-$5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure, often preceded by slipping, erratic shifting, or loud noises.
    *   Solution: Complete CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000-$5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or creaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Often caused by bushings or other suspension components.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn bushings or suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the affected part
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Honda can sometimes resolve this issue. In some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically free, Infotainment unit replacement: $500-$1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery can drain quickly, especially if it sits unused for a few days. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Identify and address the source of the parasitic draw. It could be a faulty module, aftermarket accessories, or other electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the draw. Battery Replacement: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Cracked Windshield**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windshields cracking easily due to small impacts.

**Summary**

The 2019 Honda Civic is a generally reliable car, but it does have some common issues. The most significant concern is the potential for CVT problems and oil dilution in the 1.5L turbo engine. While the oil dilution issue has a software fix, CVT failure can be expensive. The infotainment issues and battery drain are less severe but can be annoying. Overall, a potential buyer should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the car and its service history before purchasing. Addressing potential issues early through proper maintenance can help mitigate more costly repairs down the road.
