The 2006 Honda S2000 is a legendary roadster known for its high-revving engine, precise handling, and engaging driving experience. It came equipped with a 2.2L F22C1 inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the S2000 for its exceptional balance, communicative steering, and the exhilarating VTEC experience. Common criticisms include a lack of low-end torque, a somewhat stiff ride, and limited storage space.

**Engine**

**2.2L F22C1 Inline-4**

*   **Valve Retainer Cracking/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2006-2009 S2000 models, especially those driven aggressively and at high RPMs for extended periods, may experience cracking or failure of the valve retainers. This can lead to valve drop, resulting in significant engine damage. Symptoms include ticking noises, misfires, loss of power, and potential engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of valve retainers with aftermarket options like the AP2 retainers, which have a revised design and are more durable, is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of engine damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, particularly at high RPMs and during spirited driving. This could be due to piston ring wear or valve guide issues. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Performing a compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source of the oil consumption. Depending on the results, solutions may include replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or rebuilding the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Premature Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the car's performance-oriented nature and driver habits, premature clutch wear is a common issue. Symptoms include slipping, difficulty shifting, and a high engagement point.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement with an OEM or aftermarket clutch kit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Synchronizer Wear (Specifically 2nd and 3rd gear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into 2nd or 3rd gear, especially when cold, can indicate worn synchronizers. This is common due to the transmission design and aggressive shifting.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement, including replacing the worn synchronizers and possibly other worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Premature wear and potential failure of the front lower ball joints.  Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, vague steering, and uneven tire wear. This can be dangerous if the ball joint separates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower ball joints. It's generally recommended to replace both sides at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (per side).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Damper wear.**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid, bouncing or floating feeling at high speeds, increased body roll, or longer stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace dampers with either OEM or aftermarket dampers. Consider replacing all dampers in pairs or all four to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2,000+ depending on the dampers.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Radio Display Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: LCD screen on the radio unit starts to fade or become unreadable, especially in hot weather.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the radio unit. There are also companies that specialize in repairing the LCD screen itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen (O2) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, poor fuel economy, and potentially rough idling.  The O2 sensors can fail due to age and exposure to heat.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty O2 sensor.  It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (both upstream or both downstream).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on which sensor is replaced and if DIY or professional.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Wear/Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top is prone to wear and tear, particularly at the seams and stress points. Common issues include tears, leaks, and a foggy or cracked plastic rear window.
    *   Solution: Repairing small tears, replacing the rear window, or replacing the entire soft top.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Lid Latch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The latch mechanism on the center console lid is known to break, preventing the lid from staying closed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the latch or the entire center console lid assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2006 Honda S2000 is a rewarding sports car, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues. Engine issues, particularly valve retainer concerns and oil consumption, can be expensive to address. Transmission issues such as clutch and synchronizer wear are also common due to the car's performance-oriented nature. Suspension components and electrical components may require replacement as the vehicle ages. Soft top maintenance is also necessary. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can be costly. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
