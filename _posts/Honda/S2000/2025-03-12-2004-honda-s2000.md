Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2004 Honda S2000, categorized by major components.

The 2004 Honda S2000 is a legendary roadster known for its high-revving engine, precise handling, and driver-focused experience. All 2004 S2000s came equipped with a 2.2-liter F22C1 inline-four engine producing 240 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners love the car for its engaging driving dynamics, responsive engine, and open-top experience. Criticisms often include the firm ride, especially on rough roads, limited storage space, and, depending on condition, the age of the vehicle contributes to maintenance and repair needs.

**Engine**

**F22C1 2.2L Inline-Four**

*   **Valve Retainer Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This issue is more prominent in earlier AP1 S2000 models (2000-2003) with the F20C engine but can appear in the AP2 (2004-2009) with the F22C1 with high mileage or aggressive driving. The valve retainers can crack or fail, leading to engine damage, misfires, or complete engine failure. Symptoms can include unusual engine noises, rough idling, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve retainers with updated aftermarket retainers that are more durable. A valve job may also be required if there is valve damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported increased oil consumption, particularly with higher mileage engines. The exact cause can vary but is often attributed to worn piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source. Replacing the piston rings or valve seals can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,800 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CEL P0420: Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This code indicates the catalytic converter is not functioning efficiently, and can be a very common issue in older vehicles. The Check Engine Light illuminates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter will likely resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Synchro Wear/Grinding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6-speed manual transmission can be prone to synchro wear, particularly in 2nd and 3rd gear. This manifests as grinding or difficulty shifting into these gears, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn synchros or rebuilding the transmission. Switching to a higher-quality transmission fluid might provide temporary relief.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to age, the rubber bushings in the suspension components (control arms, sway bar links, etc.) can deteriorate. This leads to clunking noises, vague handling, and increased tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings. Upgrading to polyurethane bushings can improve handling but may increase NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+ (depending on which bushings are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wheel bearings can wear out, leading to a humming or grinding noise that increases with speed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn wheel bearings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wiring harness, particularly in the engine bay, can become brittle and crack due to heat and age. This can lead to intermittent electrical problems, such as misfires, sensor malfunctions, or starting issues.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the damaged sections of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cluster LCD Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD screen in the instrument cluster can fade or become difficult to read over time.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. There are services that specialize in LCD replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Wear and Tear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top is a common area for concern. It can rip, tear, or leak due to age and exposure to the elements. The plastic rear window can also become cloudy or cracked.
    *   Solution: Repairing tears, replacing the soft top, or replacing the rear window.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Repairing a tear - $50 - $200, Replacing the soft top - $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headlight lenses can become cloudy or yellowed over time, reducing visibility at night.
    *   Solution: Polishing the headlight lenses or replacing the headlight assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Polishing - $50 - $150, Replacing - $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Radio Display Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio display can fade or become unreadable over time.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the radio unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Panel Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door panels can start to sag or separate from the door frame, particularly along the top edge.
    *   Solution: Re-gluing or replacing the door panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Honda S2000, while a fantastic sports car, has its share of potential issues due to its age. Engine issues like valve retainer wear and oil consumption can be serious and costly to address, while transmission synchro wear is a common concern. Suspension and electrical problems are typical for a car of this age. Soft top condition is a critical factor. Overall, while many of these issues are age-related and common in sports cars, careful inspection and preventative maintenance are key to enjoying the S2000 ownership experience. Potential repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
