The 2002 Honda S2000 is a legendary roadster known for its high-revving engine, precise handling, and engaging driving experience. It was only available with one engine option, the F20C 2.0L inline-4, producing 240 horsepower and 153 lb-ft of torque, and a 6-speed manual transmission. People love the S2000 for its raw, sporty feel, near-perfect weight distribution, and the addictive nature of its engine that loves to be revved to its 9,000 RPM redline. Common dislikes include the lack of low-end torque, the somewhat spartan interior, and potential maintenance costs associated with an aging sports car.

**Engine**

**F20C 2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Valve Retainer Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners of early AP1 S2000s (including the 2002 model) have reported valve retainer cracking or failure, particularly when the engine is frequently revved to its high redline. This can lead to valve drop, causing significant engine damage. Symptoms include ticking noises from the valve train, rough running, or complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve retainers with updated versions (hardened valve retainers are available) is recommended. A full valve job is highly advised after valve retainer failure and could save the engine from being replaced entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$3,000+ depending on the severity of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2002 S2000s can exhibit increased oil consumption, especially with higher mileage. This is usually due to worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings and valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6-speed manual transmission can experience synchro wear, particularly in 2nd and 3rd gear. This can manifest as grinding when shifting into these gears, especially at higher RPMs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn synchros and potentially other damaged components within the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ball joints, particularly the lower ball joints, can wear out and fail, leading to clunking noises, loose steering, and potential loss of control.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner (depending on whether you replace the entire control arm or just the ball joint).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen (O2) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The O2 sensors can fail, leading to poor fuel economy, a check engine light, and potential catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty O2 sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400 depending on which sensor needs replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The convertible top can develop tears, leaks, and wear out, especially around the seams and stress points. The plastic rear window can become cloudy and crack.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the convertible top. Replacement plastic windows can also be found to replace.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether you repair or replace the entire top.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Stereo Head Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory stereo head unit can fail, causing it to lose power, display errors, or stop working altogether.
    *   Solution: Replacing the stereo head unit with an aftermarket or refurbished unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Honda S2000 is a fantastic sports car, but prospective buyers should be aware of some potential issues. The valve retainer issue on early AP1 engines is the most serious, potentially leading to significant engine damage if not addressed. Other common problems include synchro wear in the transmission, suspension component wear, and convertible top issues. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the severity. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic familiar with S2000s is highly recommended.
