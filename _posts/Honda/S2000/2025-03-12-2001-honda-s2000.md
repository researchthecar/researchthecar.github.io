The 2001 Honda S2000 is a legendary roadster praised for its high-revving engine, precise handling, and engaging driving experience. It came exclusively with a 2.0-liter F20C inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 153 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners appreciate its sporty nature, balanced chassis, and iconic status. Common complaints revolve around its stiff ride, limited storage space, and the potential for snap oversteer for inexperienced drivers.

**Engine**

**F20C 2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2001 S2000s experienced higher than normal oil consumption, especially when driven aggressively. Owners may notice a low oil level warning light coming on more frequently than expected between oil changes. Some suspect worn piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Solution: Performing a compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source of the oil consumption. Replacing piston rings or valve seals can address the issue. Switching to a higher viscosity oil can sometimes mitigate the problem, but isn't a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the repair and whether the engine needs to be removed from the car.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Retainer Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Early production F20C engines (including 2001 models) are known to have valve retainers that are prone to cracking. This can lead to valve damage, engine misfires, and potentially catastrophic engine failure. Symptoms can include ticking noises, loss of power, and rough idling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve retainers with upgraded, more durable aftermarket versions. This usually involves removing the cylinder head and replacing all the retainers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ depending on labor rates and the extent of any collateral damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Master Cylinder Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, soft or spongy clutch pedal feel, or complete loss of clutch function. Leaking fluid around the clutch master cylinder.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch master cylinder.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Upper Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear upper control arm bushings are prone to wear, leading to rear-end clunking noises, especially over bumps, and imprecise handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings with new OEM or aftermarket polyurethane bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on whether you replace just the bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Cluster Gauge Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster gauges (tachometer, speedometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge). This can be caused by faulty capacitors or other components on the circuit board.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster. Repair options include sending the cluster to a specialist for capacitor replacement or attempting a DIY repair if skilled in electronics.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ depending on the repair method (DIY, specialist repair, or complete cluster replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio door that covers the radio and climate controls may fail to open or close properly. This is typically caused by a faulty actuator motor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the radio door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on labor rates and whether you source a new or used actuator.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Tears/Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top is susceptible to tears, especially along the seams and around the rear window. The plastic rear window can also become cloudy and brittle over time.
    *   Solution: Repairing small tears with patches or replacing the entire soft top. Replacing the plastic rear window is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether you repair or replace the top.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Trim Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic trim around the center console, particularly around the radio and climate controls, is prone to cracking, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cracked trim pieces. Finding replacement parts in good condition can be challenging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the availability and condition of replacement parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Honda S2000, while a highly desirable sports car, has a few common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most concerning are the valve retainer issue and oil consumption, both of which can lead to expensive engine repairs. Other problems like soft top wear, bushing wear, and electrical issues are also common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be significant and costly. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended to assess the condition of the car and identify any potential problems.
