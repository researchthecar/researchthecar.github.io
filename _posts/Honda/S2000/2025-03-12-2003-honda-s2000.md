The 2003 Honda S2000 is a legendary roadster known for its high-revving engine, precise handling, and engaging driving experience. It came exclusively with a 2.0-liter F20C inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 153 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners love its raw, analog feel and the thrill of pushing it to its limits. Criticisms often include its relatively stiff ride, limited practicality, and the potential for snap oversteer if not driven carefully.

**Engine**

**2.0L F20C Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, especially at higher mileage and when driven aggressively. Oil consumption can lead to premature wear and damage to the engine.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. Consider using a slightly heavier weight oil. In severe cases, a compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the cause. Valve stem seals, piston rings, or cylinder wear may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the cause and extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Retainer Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some early F20C engines (though less prevalent in 2003 models) have been known to experience valve retainer cracking, potentially leading to valve drop and catastrophic engine failure. Symptoms include unusual engine noises, rough running, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Valve retainer inspection and replacement with updated retainers is recommended as a preventative measure, especially if the engine has been subjected to high RPM use.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Master Cylinder Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The clutch master cylinder can fail, resulting in a soft or spongy clutch pedal, difficulty shifting, and potential clutch engagement issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch master cylinder. Consider replacing the slave cylinder at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Upper Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear upper control arm bushings are prone to wear, especially in cars that have been tracked or driven hard. Worn bushings can cause vague handling, rear-end instability, and increased tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear upper control arm bushings. Upgraded aftermarket bushings are available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Cluster LED Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some of the LEDs in the instrument cluster can fail, making it difficult to read gauges and information.
    *   Solution: Replacing the LED's or the cluster itself is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Wear and Tear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top is prone to wear and tear, especially along the seams and around the rear window. Cracking, tearing, and leaks are common issues.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the soft top. Replacement tops are available in various materials and price ranges.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Radio Door Latch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cover of the radio can become jammed or difficult to open because of a broken latch.
    *   Solution: Replace the radio door latch with an aftermarket part, or replace the entire head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Honda S2000 is a generally reliable sports car, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as excessive oil consumption, clutch master cylinder failure, soft top wear, and valve retainer cracking. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, but addressing them promptly is essential to maintaining the car's performance and value. Suspension bushings are also common wear items. The valve retainer issue is more of a preventative measure for cars that are regularly driven hard.
