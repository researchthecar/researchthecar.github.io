The 2009 Honda S2000 is a beloved roadster known for its high-revving engine, precise handling, and engaging driving experience. It came exclusively with a 2.2-liter F22C1 inline-4 engine producing 237 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. People adore the S2000 for its raw, connected feel, and the exhilarating rush of its VTEC engine. Common complaints revolve around the firm ride, lack of low-end torque, and potential for snap oversteer in inexperienced hands. This model year, being the last of the S2000's production run, might have slightly higher values due to its status as a collectible.
