### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Honda S2000 is a remarkably reliable sports car, especially considering its performance focus. The F20C engine, while potent, can exhibit oil consumption issues as mileage increases, and VTEC solenoid failures are not uncommon. The manual transmission is generally robust, though synchronizer wear and clutch master cylinder leaks are potential concerns. Suspension components like ball joints may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the instrument cluster, and wear on the soft top are also documented issues. Despite these points, the S2000's overall build quality and engineering contribute to a positive reliability record for its class.
