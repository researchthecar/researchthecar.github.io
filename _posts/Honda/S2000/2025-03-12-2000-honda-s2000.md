The 2000 Honda S2000 is a legendary roadster celebrated for its high-revving engine, precise handling, and engaging driving experience. It came exclusively with a 2.0L F20C inline-4 engine, producing 240 horsepower and 153 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Owners rave about the S2000's balanced chassis, quick steering, and the visceral thrill of its naturally aspirated engine. Common complaints often center around the car's limited practicality, firm ride, and the potential for snap oversteer if not driven with respect.

**Engine**

**F20C 2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Valve Retainer Cracking/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue, especially in early production models. Valve retainers can crack or fail, leading to valve drop and significant engine damage. Symptoms include a ticking or tapping noise from the engine, rough running, and eventually complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve retainers with upgraded aftermarket retainers or later-model OEM retainers (AP2).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2000 Honda S2000 models may exhibit excessive oil consumption, often caused by worn valve stem seals or piston rings. This can lead to decreased engine performance and potential damage if not monitored and addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of valve stem seals or piston rings, depending on the source of the consumption. In severe cases, an engine rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6-speed manual transmission is generally reliable but can experience synchro wear, particularly in 2nd gear. This manifests as difficulty shifting into 2nd gear, grinding noises during shifts, and potential gear pop-out.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn synchros, often requiring a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ride Height Sensitivity**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S2000 is known for its sensitive handling characteristics, and lowering the car too much can negatively impact suspension geometry. This can result in bump steer, increased roll, and unpredictable handling.
    *   Solution: Correctly adjusting the ride height and getting the suspension aligned after lowering.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Cluster issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauge cluster issues can plague the 2000 S2000 and can cause all gauges to die.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire gauge cluster with a used unit or rebuilt gauge cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electric motor that operates the hinged door over the radio can fail, resulting in the door being stuck open or closed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the radio door actuator motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Wear/Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top is prone to wear and tear, especially along the folding creases and near the rear window. Tears, leaks, and separation of the rear window are common.
    *   Solution: Patching, repair, or replacement of the soft top.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2000 Honda S2000 is a desirable sports car, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The most significant concern is the possibility of valve retainer failure, which can lead to costly engine damage. Other areas to inspect include the transmission for synchro wear, the soft top for damage, and any electrical components for proper functionality. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, addressing significant engine or transmission issues can quickly escalate costs. Overall, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is crucial to assess the condition of the car and identify any potential problems.
