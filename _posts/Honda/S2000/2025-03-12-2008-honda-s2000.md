The 2008 Honda S2000 is a legendary roadster known for its high-revving engine, precise handling, and engaging driving experience. It came exclusively with a 2.2L F22C1 inline-four engine producing 237 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise its balanced chassis, communicative steering, and the joy of revving the engine to its 8,000 RPM redline. Common complaints revolve around its relatively small interior, limited storage space, and the firm ride quality which can be unforgiving on rough roads.

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, particularly at higher mileage or with aggressive driving. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored closely. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, and potentially seeing blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Regularly check and maintain proper oil levels. Using a thicker oil can sometimes mitigate the issue. In severe cases, the engine may require internal repairs such as piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and extent of repairs needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Retainer Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Although less common on the F22C1 compared to earlier AP1 S2000 models (2.0L), some owners have reported valve retainer cracking, particularly with frequent high RPM use. This can lead to valve float, misfires, and in severe cases, dropped valves causing significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace valve retainers with upgraded aftermarket units made of stronger material.
