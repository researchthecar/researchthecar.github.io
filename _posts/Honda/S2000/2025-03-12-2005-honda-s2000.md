The 2005 Honda S2000 is a legendary roadster known for its high-revving engine, precise handling, and driver-focused experience. The only engine available was a 2.2L inline-four (F22C1) producing 240 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. It was exclusively paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Owners generally love the S2000 for its engaging driving dynamics, responsive engine, and timeless design. However, some common complaints include a relatively harsh ride, limited storage space, and certain maintenance quirks that can arise with age.

**Engine**

**2.2L F22C1 Inline-Four**

*   **Oil Consumption (High RPM Use)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience higher-than-normal oil consumption, especially during sustained high RPM operation. This can manifest as a noticeable drop in oil level between oil changes and, in severe cases, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and using a high-quality synthetic oil can help mitigate this. In some cases, valve stem seals or piston rings may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve stem seals: $800 - $1500, Piston Rings: $2500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner can wear prematurely, leading to a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. If left unaddressed, this can cause timing chain slack and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Buzzing/Chatter**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a buzzing or chattering noise from the clutch, particularly during engagement or disengagement. This can be caused by worn clutch components or issues with the dual-mass flywheel.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch kit and potentially the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hard Shifting into Certain Gears (Especially 1st and 2nd)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into 1st and 2nd gear, particularly when cold. Can also feel "notchy" or stiff.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid with Honda MTF, or replacing the shift linkage bushings. May need a full transmission rebuild in rare cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission Fluid Change: $100-$150, Shift Linkage Bushings: $50-$100, Transmission Rebuild: $2500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Cracked Upper Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A clunking noise from the front suspension, especially over bumps. Can also affect handling and alignment.
    *   Solution: Replacing the upper control arm bushings or the entire upper control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushings: $200-$400, Control Arm: $400-$800 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Toe Link Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear toe link arms can bend or fatigue, leading to alignment issues, uneven tire wear, and potential handling instability. This is more common on cars that have been tracked or driven aggressively.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear toe link arms with stronger aftermarket units.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on aftermarket parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) sensor fails, causing the TPMS light to illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty TPMS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio Display Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio display can fade or become difficult to read, especially in hot weather.
    *   Solution: Replacing the radio unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on OEM or aftermarket)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Soft Top Wear and Tear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The soft top is prone to wear and tear, especially along the seams and around the rear window. Cracking and tearing are common issues.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the soft top.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Repair: $100-$500, Replacement: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2005 Honda S2000 is a generally reliable car, but like any vehicle of its age, it has some common issues. Engine issues such as high RPM oil consumption and timing chain tensioner failure can be moderately expensive to address. The transmission can develop clutch and shifting problems, requiring clutch replacement or more in-depth repairs. Suspension issues, particularly cracked bushings, contribute to noises and potentially affect handling. Electrical gremlins, like TPMS sensor failures, are relatively minor. The soft top is susceptible to wear and tear and may require replacement. Overall, the S2000's issues are manageable with proper maintenance, but some repairs can be costly, especially those involving the engine and transmission.
