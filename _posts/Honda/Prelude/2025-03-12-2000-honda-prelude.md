The 2000 Honda Prelude is a sporty coupe known for its sleek design, fun-to-drive handling, and reliable performance. It came with two engine options: the base model featured a 2.2L SOHC VTEC inline-4 engine producing 133 hp and 154 lb-ft of torque and the upgraded SH model featured a 2.2L DOHC VTEC inline-4 engine producing 200 hp and 156 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. Owners typically praised the Prelude for its sporty handling and aesthetics, while common complaints included the car's age leading to wear and tear, as well as some specific mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**2.2L SOHC VTEC (Base Model)**

*   **Distributor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, misfires, no-start condition. The internal components of the distributor can fail due to age and heat.
    *   Solution: Replace the entire distributor assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.2L DOHC VTEC (SH Model)**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking onto the exhaust manifold, burning smell, low oil level. The valve cover gasket hardens and cracks over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Leaks (VTEC Solenoid Gasket)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking down the back of the engine, low oil level. The VTEC solenoid gasket hardens and leaks over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the VTEC solenoid gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Master Cylinder Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting, soft or spongy clutch pedal, clutch pedal sticking to the floor. The internal seals of the clutch master cylinder can fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch master cylinder.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Synchronizer Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding when shifting into specific gears (typically 2nd or 3rd), difficulty engaging gears. The synchronizers wear down over time due to friction.
    *   Solution: Rebuild the transmission with new synchronizers, or replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating, engine revving without the car accelerating, harsh or delayed shifts. Internal wear and tear or solenoid failure can cause slipping.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If that doesn't work, rebuilding or replacing the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $2000+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, excessive play in the front wheels, uneven tire wear. The lower ball joints can wear out over time, especially if the car has been driven on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Replace the lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the rear suspension, wandering or unstable feeling while driving, uneven tire wear. The rear trailing arm bushings can crack and wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Main Relay Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent no-start condition, especially in hot weather. The main relay can crack due to age.
    *   Solution: Replace the main relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window moving slowly or not at all, grinding noise when operating the window. The power window regulator motor or cable can fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window regulator assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Rear Quarter Panels/Wheel Wells)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the rear quarter panels and around the wheel wells. This is a common issue, especially in areas with road salt.
    *   Solution: Repair the rusted areas by cutting out the affected metal and welding in new panels, or apply rust inhibitors to slow down the process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**

**Summary**

The 2000 Honda Prelude, while a well-regarded sports coupe, is subject to the wear and tear that comes with age. Engine issues like oil leaks and distributor failure, transmission issues like slipping in the automatic and synchro wear in the manual, suspension problems like ball joint and bushing failure, and electrical issues like relay and regulator failures can occur. Rust is a common problem on the exterior, and dashboard cracking is a frequent interior complaint. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but some repairs, such as transmission rebuilds or rust repair, can be quite expensive. Addressing these common problems is crucial for maintaining the reliability and enjoyment of this classic Honda.
