**Summary**

The 2001 Honda Prelude is a generally reliable sports coupe, but it does have some common issues to watch out for. Engine issues such as oil consumption and distributor failure can be expensive to repair. Manual transmission synchro wear is another potential costly issue. Rust is a major concern, particularly in areas with harsh winter conditions. Electrical problems, such as power window regulator failure, are relatively common and can be moderately expensive. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these problems when considering a 2001 Honda Prelude.
