**Introduction:**

The 1999 Honda Prelude was a popular sports car known for its sleek design and agile handling. It was available with two engine options: a 2.2-liter inline-four (H23A4) producing 195 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque and a 2.2-liter VTEC inline-four (H22A7) producing 200 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a 5-speed manual transmission as standard, while a 4-speed automatic transmission was optional.
