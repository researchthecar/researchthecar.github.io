**1990 Honda Prelude**

The 1990 Honda Prelude is a compact sports car that was produced from 1990 to 1991. The Prelude was available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-four and a 2.1-liter inline-four. Both engines were paired with a five-speed manual transmission. The Prelude was also available with a four-wheel steering system, which was a first for a production car.

The Prelude was praised for its handling, performance, and affordability. However, it was also criticized for its lack of rear seat space and its cramped interior.
