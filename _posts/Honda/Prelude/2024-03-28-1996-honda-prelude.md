**Introduction:**
The 1996 Honda Prelude is a sporty coupe known for its stylish design, handling, and performance. It is available with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine is a 2.2-liter 4-cylinder that produces 160 horsepower and 150 pound-feet of torque. The upgraded engine is a 2.2-liter VTEC 4-cylinder that produces 195 horsepower and 172 pound-feet of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.2-liter 4-cylinder**
* **Head gasket failure:** Premature failure of the head gasket, typically between 100,000-150,000 miles. Symptoms include overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and coolant leaks. **Solution:** Replace the head gasket. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt drives the camshafts and must be replaced regularly (every 60,000-75,000 miles). Failure to replace it can lead to catastrophic engine damage. **Solution:** Replace the timing belt, tensioner, and water pump. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000
* **Distributor issues:** Early models may experience distributor cap and rotor wear, leading to ignition problems. **Solution:** Replace the distributor cap and rotor. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $250
* **Water pump failure:** The water pump circulates coolant through the engine and can fail over time. **Solution:** Replace the water pump. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $600+
* **Recalls:**
    * 99V089000: Front wheel hub cracking

**2.2-liter VTEC 4-cylinder**
* **Piston ring failure:** Some engines may experience excessive oil consumption due to worn piston rings. **Solution:** Replace the piston rings. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $3,000+
* **VTEC solenoid issues:** The VTEC solenoid controls the variable valve timing system and can malfunction, leading to reduced power and fuel economy. **Solution:** Replace the VTEC solenoid. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500
* **Other issues:** Inherited all potential issues from the base 2.2-liter engine

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual**
* **Gear synchronization issues:** Some transmissions may experience difficulty shifting smoothly, particularly into second and third gears. **Solution:** Repair or replace the damaged synchronizers. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+
* **Clutch issues:** Worn clutch plates can lead to slipping and difficulty engaging gears. **Solution:** Replace the clutch. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $700 - $1,500

**4-speed Automatic**
* **Transmission slipping:** Worn transmission components can cause the transmission to slip out of gear. **Solution:** Rebuild or replace the transmission. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Torque converter issues:** The torque converter can fail prematurely, leading to transmission damage. **Solution:** Replace the torque converter. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000

**Summary:**
The 1996 Honda Prelude is a reliable and enjoyable sports car, but it can experience some common issues as it ages. The most severe and costly potential problems relate to the 2.2-liter VTEC engine, head gasket failure, and transmission slipping. Regular maintenance and inspections can help prevent these issues and maintain the Prelude's long-term performance and reliability.
