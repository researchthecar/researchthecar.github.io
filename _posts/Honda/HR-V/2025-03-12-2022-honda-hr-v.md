The 2022 Honda HR-V marked a significant redesign for the model. It came with a single engine option, a 2.0-liter inline-four cylinder engine producing 158 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the HR-V's improved interior space and comfort compared to previous generations, along with its more refined driving experience. Common criticisms often include the lack of available engine upgrades, as well as the CVT transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-Four Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. The frequency varies from owner to owner, some reporting more than 1 quart every 1,000 miles. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and topping off as needed. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection may be necessary to check for leaks or internal engine issues. Some owners have suggested using a different weight oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis at a dealership may range from $100 - $200. If an engine replacement is needed, it could be $5,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation or Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or a slight jerking sensation when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This is often described as the CVT "searching" for the correct ratio.
    *   Solution: A software update to the CVT control module may improve shift logic and reduce hesitation. In some cases, a CVT fluid change may be recommended. For some owners, the issue persists and may require CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update $100 - $200. CVT fluid change $150 - $300. CVT Replacement $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, especially on trims with the larger touchscreen, can sometimes freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reboot to resolve temporarily.
    *   Solution: Check for available software updates for the infotainment system. A hard reset of the system may provide a temporary fix. If the problem persists, the head unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically free at the dealership. Head unit replacement $500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: In some cases, the backup camera displays a blank screen or distorted image, intermittently or consistently. This can hinder visibility when reversing.
    * Solution: Check the camera connections for damage or looseness. Replacing the camera is often the solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ for camera replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or center console, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and using foam padding or other sound-deadening materials to secure the loose components. This often requires disassembly of the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Can range from a DIY fix with minimal cost to $100+ if a professional is needed to diagnose and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Honda HR-V, while generally well-received for its redesign and improved interior, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most frequently cited complaints revolve around the infotainment system, with some owners reporting lagging and freezing issues. Other potential problems include hesitation or jerking during acceleration with the CVT, and excessive oil consumption for some engines. Repair costs can vary significantly, with some issues being relatively inexpensive to resolve (e.g., software updates), while others (e.g., transmission replacement) can be quite costly. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to more significant drivability or reliability concerns, emphasizing the importance of a thorough inspection and test drive before purchasing a used 2022 HR-V.
