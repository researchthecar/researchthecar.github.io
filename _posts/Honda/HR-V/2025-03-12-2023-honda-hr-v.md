The 2023 Honda HR-V represents the beginning of its second generation, marking a significant redesign. All 2023 HR-Vs are equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 158 horsepower and 138 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate its improved ride quality and interior space compared to the previous generation. However, a common complaint revolves around its perceived lack of power and acceleration. Fuel economy is decent for its class.

**Summary**

The 2023 Honda HR-V presents a mixed bag of issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine and transmission, particularly hesitation, jerking, and noise from the CVT.
