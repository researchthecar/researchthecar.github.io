Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2021 Honda HR-V, following your specified format.

The 2021 Honda HR-V is a subcompact SUV known for its practicality, spacious interior for its class, and fuel efficiency. It's powered by a 1.8-liter inline-4 engine producing 141 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). A common point of praise is its "Magic Seat" configuration, which allows for versatile cargo arrangements. However, criticisms often target its underwhelming acceleration and somewhat dated infotainment system. While the HR-V is not known for being quick, it does offer a comfortable ride and good fuel economy.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, or noticing a drop in oil level on the dipstick well before the next service interval.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently and consult with a Honda dealer for potential causes, which may include worn piston rings or valve seals. A compression test may be necessary to diagnose the issue. Depending on the cause, solutions range from using a heavier weight oil to engine component replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (oil consumption test) to $2000+ (engine repair/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a jerky or hesitant feeling during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This may be described as a "shudder" or a momentary delay in power delivery when pressing the accelerator.
    *   Solution: A software update for the CVT control module may resolve this issue. In some cases, a CVT fluid change might alleviate symptoms. Severe cases may require CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (CVT fluid change) to $400 (Software update) to $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: CVT completely stops functioning. Vehicle is immobile. This could be caused by a faulty CVT belt.
    *   Solution: Replace CVT.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A clunking or rattling noise emanating from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This may be caused by worn or loose suspension components, such as sway bar links or bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components, such as sway bar links, bushings, or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the specific components needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions controlled through the system.
    *   Solution: Try performing a system reset. A software update from the dealer may address the issue. In rare cases, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (system reset) to $100 - $200 (software update) to $500 - $1500+ (infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain or failure, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Test the battery's health. Replace the battery if it is faulty. Investigate potential parasitic draws that could be draining the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (battery replacement) to $100 - $500+ (diagnosing and fixing parasitic drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or buzzing noises coming from the dashboard or interior trim panels, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and secure the loose trim panels or components. This may involve adding foam padding or using clips to tighten connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY fix) to $100 - $300+ (dealer/mechanic to diagnose and fix).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Honda HR-V, while generally reliable, does have some reported issues. The most concerning are the potential for CVT problems and excessive oil consumption, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues like infotainment glitches and battery problems are less severe but can be frustrating. Interior rattles are more of an annoyance than a critical issue. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have a pre-purchase inspection performed, especially focusing on the CVT's condition and oil consumption.
