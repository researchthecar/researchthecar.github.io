The 2018 Honda HR-V is a subcompact crossover known for its versatility, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior for its class. It comes equipped with a 1.8-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine producing 141 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission (FWD models only) or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) available with both FWD and AWD. Owners generally appreciate the HR-V's fuel economy and clever "Magic Seat" system which allows for a variety of cargo configurations. However, some criticisms include the engine's lack of power, especially when fully loaded or going uphill, and the somewhat noisy CVT transmission.
