The 2019 Honda HR-V is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and Honda's reputation for reliability. It is powered by a 1.8-liter inline-4 engine producing 141 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. All trims come standard with front-wheel drive and a continuously variable transmission (CVT), though all-wheel drive is available. People generally appreciate the HR-V's practical cargo space (especially with the "Magic Seat" configuration), fuel economy, and maneuverability. Common complaints include the engine's lack of power, the noisy CVT, and the somewhat basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.8L Inline-4 (i-VTEC)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add a quart of oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Honda issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) on 2016-2021 models (TSB# A20-066) to address this, which suggests that this issue may be due to the piston rings. Some dealerships may perform an oil consumption test to determine if the engine requires replacement of the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on whether the issue is resolved with cleaning or a complete engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Experiencing engine misfires, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating. Error codes related to misfires on specific cylinders may be present (e.g., P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304).
    * Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the misfire, which may involve replacing faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per cylinder (depending on the component needing replacement and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Juddering/Shaking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a juddering or shaking sensation, especially during light acceleration or at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or hesitating.
    *   Solution: A software update may improve the transmission's performance or replacing the CVT fluid can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT unit itself may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or hesitant engagement when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse. The vehicle may take a moment to respond after the gear selector is moved.
    *   Solution: Performing a CVT fluid change and inspecting the transmission control module (TCM) for any issues. In some cases, the TCM may need reprogramming or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $1,000+ (TCM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises emanating from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and replacing worn suspension components such as sway bar links, bushings, or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the parts needing replacement and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, requiring frequent jump-starts or battery replacements. This may occur even when the vehicle is not in use for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the source of the parasitic draw, which may involve testing the alternator, starter, and other electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the component causing the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unresponsiveness of the infotainment system. This can include problems with the touchscreen display, Bluetooth connectivity, and navigation functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or software update may resolve minor glitches. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) - $1,000+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or buzzing noises originating from the dashboard or other interior trim pieces, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating and securing loose trim panels or components. Adding padding or insulation may help to dampen the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Honda HR-V is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with excessive oil consumption, CVT performance, suspension noises, electrical problems, and interior rattles. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to more significant repairs. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as CVT or engine repairs, can be costly. It's advisable to have a thorough inspection performed by a qualified mechanic before purchasing a used 2019 HR-V and to address any potential issues promptly to prevent further damage. The oil consumption issue can be very costly.
