Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 Honda HR-V, categorized by component and powertrain configuration. The 2017 Honda HR-V is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior (especially for its class), and Honda's reputation for reliability. It's powered by a 1.8-liter inline-4 engine producing 141 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (FWD only) and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) available with both FWD and AWD. While owners generally appreciate the HR-V's practicality and fuel economy, some common complaints revolve around the vehicle's acceleration, road noise, and the infotainment system.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes.
    *   Solution: Honda has not issued an official fix. Monitor oil levels regularly and consider switching to a higher-viscosity oil. Some owners have attempted valve seal replacements, but results vary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes may indicate misfires in specific cylinders.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the root cause (ignition coils, spark plugs, fuel injectors, or vacuum leaks). Replace faulty components as needed.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This is often described as a "rubber-banding" feeling.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid change with genuine Honda HCF-2 fluid. In some cases, a CVT software update or complete CVT replacement may be necessary.

    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn-out rear shock absorbers, sway bar links, or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery frequently dies, even after short periods of inactivity. Difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested and replaced if necessary. Check for parasitic draws from aftermarket accessories or faulty electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (Battery replacement). Parasitic draw diagnosis can vary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system freezes, glitches, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and camera malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the infotainment system. Check for software updates. If the problems persist, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.

**Summary**

The 2017 Honda HR-V is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported some common issues. The CVT transmission can experience juddering and whining, which may require fluid changes or, in severe cases, replacement. The engine may exhibit excessive oil consumption. Electrical problems such as battery drain and infotainment glitches can also occur. Windshield cracks and seat fabric wear are less severe but can be frustrating. The cost of repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like fluid changes to more costly replacements of the CVT, AC compressor, or infotainment unit. Overall, it is still considered a reliable vehicle that can be fixed affordably if maintained properly.
