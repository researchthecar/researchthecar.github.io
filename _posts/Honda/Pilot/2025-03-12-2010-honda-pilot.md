Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2010 Honda Pilot, categorized by major component.

The 2010 Honda Pilot is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reliability. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 250 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option was a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Pilot for its practicality, family-friendly features, and reputation for longevity. Common complaints include lower than expected gas mileage and some reported issues with the vehicle's electronics, and some report issues with the VCM system (Variable Cylinder Management), which aims to improve fuel efficiency by deactivating cylinders, but can lead to problems.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (J35Z4)**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, rough idling, and vibration, particularly when the VCM system activates/deactivates cylinders. Can also cause premature catalytic converter failure.
    *   Solution: Disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices (VCM Tuner II, S-VCM Controller) is a common solution. Replacing fouled spark plugs and monitoring oil levels are necessary. Addressing catalytic converter failure requires replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: VCM disabler $100 - $200, spark plug replacement $150 - $300, catalytic converter replacement $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration felt in the cabin, especially at idle or during acceleration. Often accompanied by a clunking noise.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed engine mount(s). Front and rear mounts are most common to fail.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per mount, depending on location and labor rates.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. Can also manifest as slipping during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid drain and refill using Honda Genuine ATF-Z1 or DW-1 fluid. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required, including checking solenoids and valve body. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change $100 - $200, solenoid replacement $200 - $400, valve body repair $500 - $1000, transmission rebuild $2500 - $4000, transmission replacement $3500 - $6000+

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Weakness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. Can lead to a bouncy ride and reduced handling.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Shock replacement $200 - $500, spring replacement $300 - $600.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut and Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll during turns, leaking fluid from the struts or shocks.
