The 2015 Honda Pilot is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed automatic transmission for the 2WD trim or a 5-speed automatic transmission for the AWD trim. Owners generally appreciate the Pilot's practicality, safety features, and smooth driving experience. Common dislikes include the somewhat outdated interior design, the 5-speed automatic transmission feeling less refined than the 6-speed, and some reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idling, and engine misfires. The VCM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can lead to uneven wear and oil leaking past the piston rings in deactivated cylinders.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using an aftermarket device like a VCM tuner or muzzler. More invasive solutions include replacing the piston rings and spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (VCM tuner) - $2000+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (AWD)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. Some owners report a noticeable "clunk" or hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, or in more severe cases, rebuild or replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid flush), $2500 - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (2WD)**
    * No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. Can lead to a rougher ride and decreased handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shocks and/or coil springs. Air suspension conversion kits are also available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (shock and spring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, difficulty starting the vehicle, and warning lights related to the charging system. This can be caused by a malfunctioning BMS module that doesn't properly regulate charging.
    *   Solution: Replace the BMS module and/or the battery. Ensure the battery is properly registered with the system after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Display Screen Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment display screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or exhibit lines/distortion. This can be caused by a software glitch or a hardware failure.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset (disconnecting the battery for a short period). If the problem persists, the display screen may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (Software Update/Reset), $500 - $1500+ (Display Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Tailgate Malfunction (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power tailgate may fail to open or close properly, get stuck halfway, or emit unusual noises. This can be caused by a faulty motor, sensor, or latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Inspect the tailgate motor, sensors, and latch for damage or obstructions. Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation System Problems (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inaccurate GPS location, difficulty acquiring a satellite signal, or outdated map data.
    *   Solution: Update the navigation system software and map data. If the GPS receiver is faulty, it may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Software Update), $300 - $800+ (GPS Receiver Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Honda Pilot is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the VCM system and the 5-speed automatic transmission in AWD models. Electrical issues with the battery management system and display screen are also possible. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like replacing piston rings or a transmission, can be costly.
