Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2012 Honda Pilot, formatted for your website.

The 2012 Honda Pilot is a popular mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, reliability, and family-friendly features. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 250 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Pilot for its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and reputation for longevity. However, some common complaints include issues with the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, fuel economy that doesn't always live up to expectations, and some reported electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idling, vibrations, and spark plug fouling are common symptoms. The VCM system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can lead to these issues as the deactivated cylinders can allow oil to seep past the piston rings.
    *   Solution: Disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices (VCMTuner II, S-VCM Controller) can mitigate the oil consumption and vibration issues. Replacing fouled spark plugs is also necessary. A more involved repair might involve replacing the piston rings and/or addressing cylinder head issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (VCM Disabler), $100 - $400+ (spark plug replacement), $2000 - $5000+ (piston ring replacement/engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration, especially at idle or during acceleration. Noises coming from the engine bay. The engine mount can degrade and cause excessive movement of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn engine mounts. Replacing all the engine mounts at the same time is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting, delayed engagement, harsh or jerky shifts, and a general lack of responsiveness from the transmission. These issues can stem from low transmission fluid, worn clutch packs, or valve body problems.
    *   Solution: A simple first step is to check and replace the transmission fluid with Honda ATF-DW1. In some cases, replacing the valve body or rebuilding the transmission is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (fluid change), $500 - $1500+ (valve body replacement), $2500 - $4500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation, particularly at low speeds or during light acceleration. This is caused by the torque converter not locking up properly.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with Honda ATF-DW1 may resolve the issue temporarily. Replacing the torque converter or rebuilding the transmission might be necessary for a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (fluid flush), $800 - $2000+ (torque converter replacement), $2500 - $4500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bumpy ride, excessive bouncing, poor handling, and rear end sagging. Leaking fluid from the shock absorbers may also be visible.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers. Replacing both shocks at the same time is highly recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and uneven tire wear can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks. The door may not lock or unlock with the remote or the door switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, incorrect mapping, and difficulty updating the system.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the navigation system by disconnecting the battery for a few minutes. Updating the navigation software may also help. If the issue persists, the navigation unit might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset), $50 - $200+ (software update), $500 - $1500+ (navigation unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The tailgate doesn't stay open and tends to slam shut. Difficulty opening and closing the tailgate.
    *   Solution: Replace the tailgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof not opening or closing smoothly, getting stuck, or making unusual noises. Water leaks around the sunroof.
    *   Solution: Clean and lubricate the sunroof tracks. Replace damaged seals. If the motor is faulty, it will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (cleaning/lubrication), $100 - $400+ (seal replacement), $300 - $800+ (motor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Honda Pilot, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues. The most common and potentially costly problem revolves around the VCM system, which can lead to excessive oil consumption and engine vibrations. Transmission issues such as slipping and shuddering can also occur. Other problems, such as electrical glitches and suspension wear, are relatively common for vehicles of this age. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase. The severity of these issues varies, but addressing them proactively can help prevent more significant and expensive repairs down the line.
