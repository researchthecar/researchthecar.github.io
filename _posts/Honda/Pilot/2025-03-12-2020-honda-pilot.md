The 2020 Honda Pilot is a popular mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and family-friendly features. It generally receives positive reviews for reliability, but like any vehicle, it has its share of reported problems. The 2020 Pilot came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed automatic transmission (LX, EX, EX-L trims) or a 9-speed automatic transmission (Touring, Elite, Black Edition trims). What people generally like about the Pilot is its practicality, roomy third row, and reputation for Honda reliability. Common dislikes include the sometimes-clunky 9-speed transmission, and the infotainment system's interface.
