The 2006 Honda Pilot is a mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 244 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Pilot's dependability, practicality, and smooth driving experience. However, some common complaints include issues with the transmission, particularly as the vehicle ages, as well as some electrical problems and concerns about fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (J35A9)**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VCM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, and engine misfires. Drivers may notice rough idling, decreased performance, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using a VCM disabler device or install a VCM tuner. In severe cases, replace spark plugs, clean or replace fouled oxygen sensors, or repair/replace piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: VCM disabler ($100-$200), Spark plug replacement ($100-$300), Oxygen sensor replacement ($150-$400), Piston ring repair ($1,500-$3,000+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Motor Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The motor mounts that hold the engine in place can deteriorate over time. Symptoms can include excessive vibration, clunking noises from the engine bay, and visible damage to the motor mounts upon inspection.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed motor mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported complete transmission failure. Symptoms include slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, inability to shift into certain gears, and unusual noises coming from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement or rebuild
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration, most noticeable at lower speeds or during light acceleration. Often caused by deterioration of the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter, flush the transmission fluid, and potentially replace the transmission filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **3rd and 4th Gear Clutch Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping or hesitation when shifting into 3rd or 4th gear, particularly under load. This is often a sign of worn or damaged clutch packs within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, particularly if the vehicle is frequently used for towing or carrying heavy loads. This can lead to a rough ride, reduced handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shocks, springs, or both. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty components for improved load-carrying capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, leaking fluid from struts/shocks, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and/or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock properly, or making a buzzing noise when activated.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver's Power Seat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Driver's side power seat stops working, or will only move forwards and backwards, but not up and down.
    *   Solution: Replace the motor, or the entire assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250-$600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Quarter Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the rear quarter panels, particularly around the wheel wells. This is a common issue in areas with harsh winters or heavy road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Repair rust damage by sanding, patching, and repainting the affected areas. Address the underlying cause of the rust by applying rust inhibitors or protective coatings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1500+ per panel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin through the sunroof, particularly during heavy rain. This can be caused by clogged drain tubes or a damaged sunroof seal.
    *   Solution: Clean or unclog the sunroof drain tubes. Replace the sunroof seal if it is damaged or deteriorated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Honda Pilot, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues as it ages. The most concerning are transmission problems, which can be costly to repair. VCM-related engine issues are also common and can lead to increased maintenance costs. Suspension and electrical problems are less severe but still worth noting. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, paying close attention to transmission performance, engine health (oil consumption and VCM system), and the condition of the suspension. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
