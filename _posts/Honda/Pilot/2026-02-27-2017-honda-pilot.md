### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Honda Pilot generally offers a reliable ownership experience, particularly with its 3.5L V6 engine. However, potential owners should be aware of issues related to the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, which can lead to rough running and oil consumption. Transmission reliability varies between the 6-speed and the more complex 9-speed automatic; the latter has seen more reports of shifting anomalies. Electrical gremlins, primarily concerning the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically robust. Addressing VCM and transmission software updates or services proactively can help mitigate common problems.
