The 2004 Honda Pilot is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 engine, producing 240 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Pilot for its longevity, practicality, and smooth V6 engine. Common complaints often center around the age of the vehicle now (potential for increased maintenance), fuel economy, and some specific issues that surface with higher mileage.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (J35A6)**

*   **VCM Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption due to the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system causing piston rings to foul. This often leads to misfires, rough idle, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Deactivating the VCM system using aftermarket devices, or more extensive repairs like piston ring replacement (expensive). Spark plug replacement can temporarily alleviate misfires.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for a VCM disabler, $2,000 - $4,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Honda Pilot, while generally reliable, can exhibit several common issues due to its age. Engine problems, particularly those related to VCM and oil leaks, can be costly to address. Transmission issues are also possible, and preventative maintenance like fluid changes is crucial. Suspension components wear over time, and electrical problems are not uncommon. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in areas with road salt. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering a 2004 Pilot. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
