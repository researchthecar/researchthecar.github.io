The 2016 Honda Pilot is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reliability. It offers seating for up to eight passengers, making it a popular choice for families. The primary engine option is a 3.5L V6, producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed automatic transmission was standard on the LX, EX, and EX-L trims, while a 9-speed automatic transmission was available on the Touring and Elite trims. People generally appreciate the Pilot's smooth ride, fuel efficiency, and family-friendly features. However, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, transmission performance (specifically the 9-speed), and certain electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idling, vibration at low speeds, and potential spark plug fouling. The VCM system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can lead to these issues due to uneven wear and oil accumulation.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices (VCM Tuner II, S-VCM Controller). Perform a cylinder leakdown test to check engine health. Replace faulty spark plugs and clean intake valves if necessary. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (VCM disable device) - $300 (spark plug replacement and cleaning) - $3000+ (engine repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, rough running engine, lack of power, and poor fuel economy. Misfires can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the misfire using an OBDII scanner. Replace faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (per ignition coil or fuel injector)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   No Issues Found

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting and Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation when accelerating, especially from a stop. These issues are often attributed to the transmission's programming and adaptation learning.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush using genuine Honda fluid. Reset the transmission's learning parameters using a diagnostic tool. Software updates may also be available from Honda to improve shift quality. In some cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush and reset) - $1000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of drive, transmission slipping, loud noises coming from the transmission, check engine light illuminated. Can be caused by internal damage to the transmission components.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3500 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fluid leaking from rear shock absorbers, bouncy ride, reduced handling performance, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slow response times, freezing, crashing, and Bluetooth connectivity problems. Touchscreen unresponsiveness, navigation errors, and audio malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Perform a hard reset of the infotainment system. Check for software updates from Honda and install them. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $100 - $200 (software updates, if available) - $500 - $1500+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the engine, and the need for frequent jump starts. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component or a faulty battery.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Identify and repair any parasitic draws. Replace the battery if it is defective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (battery replacement) - $100 - $500+ (parasitic draw diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera displays a black screen, distorted image, or no image at all when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. Replace the backup camera if it is faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (backup camera replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tailgate not opening or closing properly, beeping when attempting to use, or the tailgate only partially opening/closing. Can be caused by a faulty actuator, damaged struts, or issues with the sensors.
    *   Solution: Inspect the tailgate struts and replace if damaged. Check the tailgate actuator and replace if faulty. Recalibrate the tailgate sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (actuator or strut replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks not responding to the key fob or interior switch, door locks making a clicking noise but not engaging, or door locks randomly locking and unlocking.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 (per door lock actuator)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Honda Pilot, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues. Engine problems related to the VCM system and misfires can lead to moderate repair costs. The 9-speed automatic transmission is prone to harsh shifting and, in some cases, failure, potentially resulting in expensive repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also prevalent. While not all Pilots will experience these problems, prospective buyers should be aware of them and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures. The cost of these repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand for transmission or engine repairs.
