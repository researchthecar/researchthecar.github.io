The 2018 Honda Pilot is a popular mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reliability. It's powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with either a 6-speed automatic transmission (LX, EX, EX-L trims) or a 9-speed automatic transmission (Touring, Elite trims). Drivers appreciate the Pilot's practicality and family-friendly features, but some have reported issues with the infotainment system, transmission performance, and other components.
