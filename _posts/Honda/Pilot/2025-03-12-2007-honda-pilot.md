The 2007 Honda Pilot is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It typically appeals to families seeking a practical and dependable vehicle with seating for up to eight passengers. Common praises include its smooth engine performance, ample cargo space, and Honda's reputation for longevity. Criticisms often involve its somewhat dated interior design for its time, fuel economy that's average for its class, and, for some, handling that feels a bit bulky. The 2007 Pilot was only offered with a single engine option, a 3.5L V6 producing around 244 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (J35A9)**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, and engine misfires. The VCM system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy, but this can lead to uneven wear and oil leakage into the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices (VCM Tuner II, S-VCM Controller) or replace faulty VCM components such as the VCM solenoid, spark plugs, and piston rings if necessary. A more permanent fix is a full engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (VCM disabler) - $300 (spark plugs & coil replacement) - $3,000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination (typically P0420 code), reduced engine performance, and failed emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty catalytic converter(s). It's often recommended to replace both converters simultaneously for optimal performance and longevity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the timing belt fails, the engine will most likely stop running immediately. Potential for severe engine damage if an interference engine.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt (along with water pump and other related components) is crucial preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (BYBA)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting between gears, slipping during acceleration, and harsh or jerky shifts. Can be more pronounced when cold.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush using genuine Honda ATF-Z1 fluid (if available) or the newer DW-1 fluid. In more severe cases, the transmission may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (fluid flush) - $2,500 - $4,500 (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop. Can also cause stalling or difficulty maintaining speed.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Often, it's recommended to replace the transmission filter and flush the transmission fluid at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, particularly when loaded with passengers or cargo. Can lead to a bumpy ride and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shocks and springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty components if the vehicle is frequently used for towing or carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Can also cause vague steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings. It's often easier and more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more power door locks fail to operate correctly. The door may not lock or unlock with the remote or the door switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or after a short period of inactivity. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw using a multimeter. Common culprits include the audio system, power windows, and security system. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation System Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Screen freezes, map data errors, or complete system failure. The navigation system in older models can be prone to these issues.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If that doesn't work, the navigation unit may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reset) - $200+ (repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear liftgate fails to stay open on its own and falls down unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replace the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof fails to open or close smoothly, makes excessive noise, or leaks water.
    *   Solution: Clean and lubricate the sunroof tracks and seals. If the motor is faulty, it may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (lubrication) - $400+ (motor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Honda Pilot, while generally reliable, has some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine's VCM system and the transmission's performance. Oil consumption due to VCM can be costly, but the VCM disabler is a cheap option that could prolong the engine's life. Transmission issues can be expensive to repair. Electrical problems and suspension wear are also common but typically less costly to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and condition before purchasing. Address any of these issues sooner than later, as they could damage other parts of the vehicle, leading to a much larger repair bill.
