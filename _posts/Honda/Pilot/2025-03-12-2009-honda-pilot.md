Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2009 Honda Pilot, separated by category and engine/transmission configuration, following your specified format.

The 2009 Honda Pilot is a popular SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and family-friendly features. It was only available with a single engine and transmission option: a 3.5L V6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and Honda's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include relatively poor fuel economy for its class and some dated interior features compared to newer SUVs.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (J35Z4)**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, fouled spark plugs, engine misfires, and rough idling. This is often linked to the VCM system which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices or address the root cause, which can involve replacing piston rings, spark plugs, or cleaning intake manifolds.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (VCM disabler) - $2000+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, especially at lower speeds. This can indicate a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter or rebuild the transmission. Replacing the transmission is the only way to fix the Torque Converter from my research.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,500 depending on if you rebuild or replace
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh gear changes, or failure to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, especially when loaded. Premature wear of rear shocks and springs.
    *   Solution: Replace rear shocks and springs. Consider heavy-duty options if the vehicle is frequently used for towing or hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replace front strut mounts and possibly struts if worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks failing to function properly, either intermittently or completely.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a few days, even with a new battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the parasitic draw, which can be caused by a faulty relay, module, or wiring issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear hatch not staying open on its own, requiring manual support.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof failing to open or close properly, getting stuck, or making excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the sunroof mechanism, which may involve cleaning, lubricating, or replacing parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **A/C Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A/C blowing warm air, loud noises from the A/C compressor, or complete A/C system failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the A/C compressor, receiver drier, and expansion valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Honda Pilot, while generally reliable, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The VCM system and potential for excessive oil consumption in the engine are major concerns, as are the transmission issues related to the torque converter and shift solenoids. Suspension and electrical problems, while less severe, can also contribute to ownership costs. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (hatch struts, door locks) to potentially expensive (engine or transmission rebuild). Addressing these issues proactively can help maintain the Pilot's reliability and extend its lifespan.
