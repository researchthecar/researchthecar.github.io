The 2013 Honda Pilot is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Pilot's practicality, smooth ride, and reputation for longevity. However, some dislike its somewhat bland styling and the outdated 5-speed transmission compared to competitors with more gears. Common complaints also include issues with the VCM system and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (J35Z4)**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, engine misfires, and vibrations due to the VCM system deactivating cylinders to improve fuel economy. This can lead to the engine running roughly and potential catalytic converter damage.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices, such as a VCM Tuner II. Replacing spark plugs, cleaning the intake manifold, and decarbonizing the engine may temporarily alleviate symptoms. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and chosen solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, especially at idle or low speeds. Clunking noises from the engine bay during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty engine mounts. Honda recommends replacing all mounts simultaneously for optimal performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shudder or vibration during light acceleration, typically between 30-50 mph. This is often caused by wear in the torque converter.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change using genuine Honda ATF-DW1 fluid may temporarily alleviate the issue. A complete torque converter replacement is the more permanent solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $1500+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifting between gears. The transmission may slip, causing a temporary loss of power.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush with genuine Honda ATF-DW1 fluid. If the issue persists, internal damage may require a rebuild or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits noticeably lower than the front, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. This can lead to a bumpy ride and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shocks, and springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may intermittently fail to lock or unlock, or they may not function at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Hatch Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electric rear hatch may fail to open or close properly, or may only work intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear hatch actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors droop down and will not stay in the upright position.
    *   Solution: Replace the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per visor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Honda Pilot is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the VCM system, transmission shudder, and electrical components. The VCM issue can lead to costly engine repairs if not addressed, while transmission problems can range from minor inconvenience to major expense. Electrical issues are typically less severe but can still be frustrating. Overall, the 2013 Pilot has some known issues, but they are not necessarily widespread and can often be mitigated with preventative maintenance and timely repairs.
