The 2005 Honda Pilot is a mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spaciousness, and practicality. It offered seating for eight passengers and a comfortable ride, making it a popular choice for families. Power came from a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 240 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While generally well-regarded, owners have reported certain recurring issues over the years. Some owners praised its comfortable ride and spacious interior, while others disliked its fuel economy and somewhat dated styling.

**Engine**

**3.5L J35A6 V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, engine misfires, and rough idling. This is often caused by the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, which shuts off cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can lead to uneven wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using a VCM disabler device. Install a Muzzler device. Regular spark plug changes, using high quality synthetic oil, and performing regular oil changes may also reduce issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $120 - $300+ (VCM Disabler/Muzzler Device)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine failure, due to the timing belt snapping. This can cause significant damage to the engine's valves and pistons.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, water pump, and tensioner as part of a preventative maintenance schedule (every 60,000-100,000 miles).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Cylinder Bank Oil Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking onto the exhaust manifold, causing burning smells and potentially smoke.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket and potentially the spark plug tube seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shifting Problems/Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation between gear changes, harsh or jerky shifting, and difficulty engaging certain gears. These are often caused by worn solenoids.
    *   Solution: Replace the transmission fluid with Honda ATF-Z1, or DW-1. If the problem persists, replace faulty solenoids, or valve body assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (Fluid Change), $300 - $800+ (Solenoid/Valve Body Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Sagging Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than the front, especially when loaded. This is often caused by worn rear springs or shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear springs and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Bushings and Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises when driving over bumps, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn bushings (control arm, sway bar) and ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more door locks fail to lock or unlock with the remote or the door switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch will not stay open or closes unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust develops on the rear wheel arches, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Repair the rust (sanding, filling, painting) or replace the affected body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: AC blows warm air, often due to a refrigerant leak, compressor failure, or a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Recharge the AC system, repair any leaks, replace the compressor, or replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appear on the dashboard surface, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Honda Pilot is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as VCM-related oil consumption, transmission shifting problems, and suspension wear. While some issues like VCM can be addressed with relatively inexpensive solutions, others, like transmission problems or rust repair, can be more costly. Regular maintenance, including timely timing belt replacement and fluid changes, can help prevent some of these problems.
