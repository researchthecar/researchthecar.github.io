Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Honda Pilot, formatted as requested.

The 2019 Honda Pilot is a mid-size SUV known for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and reliability. It came equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine (280 hp, 262 lb-ft of torque) paired with either a 6-speed automatic transmission (LX, EX, EX-L trims) or a 9-speed automatic transmission (Touring, Elite trims). Owners appreciate the Pilot's family-friendly features and reputation for longevity. Common dislikes include the sometimes clunky operation of the 9-speed transmission and the infotainment system's complexity.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, engine misfires, and rough idling. These issues are often attributed to the VCM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system with an aftermarket device (VCM Tuner II, S-VCM Controller). Replacing the spark plugs can resolve misfires. In severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250 for VCM disabler, $100 - $300+ for spark plug replacement, $2,000 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, poor fuel economy, and difficulty starting.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty fuel injector and replace it. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure even fuel distribution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+ per injector (parts and labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   No Issues Found

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough shifts, particularly between lower gears (1st-3rd), hesitation when accelerating, and occasional "clunking" noises.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) are the first step. In some cases, transmission fluid changes can help. In severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for software update, $150 - $300 for fluid change, $1,000 - $2,500+ for valve body replacement, $4,000 - $7,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or leaking of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy ride and reduced handling stability. Often found during routine maintenance inspections.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure and instances of the battery draining overnight. Can be attributed to parasitic drain from various electronic components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw using a multimeter. Common culprits include the infotainment system, hands-free system, or aftermarket accessories. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, glitches with the navigation system, and Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates can often resolve these issues. A hard reset of the infotainment system might be necessary. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $500 - $1500+ for unit replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate failing to open or close properly, getting stuck mid-cycle, or making unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the tailgate struts or the motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rear Entertainment System (RES) Problems (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The RES screen freezing, not displaying video, or experiencing audio issues.
    *   Solution: Check the connections and wiring. Software updates may be available. In some cases, the RES unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ for unit replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Honda Pilot is generally a reliable vehicle, but some common issues exist. The most significant concerns revolve around the 3.5L V6 engine's VCM system, potentially leading to excessive oil consumption, and the 9-speed transmission's harsh shifting. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and potential battery drain problems also warrant attention. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive (VCM disabler, software updates), others, like transmission or engine repairs, can be costly. When considering a used 2019 Pilot, checking the vehicle's maintenance history and addressing any concerning symptoms promptly is advisable.
