Here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 Honda Pilot, organized by category and component. The 2017 Honda Pilot is a popular mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reliability. The 2017 models came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine that produced 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed automatic transmission (LX, EX, EX-L trims) or a 9-speed automatic transmission (Touring, Elite trims). Owners generally appreciate the Pilot's family-friendly features, smooth driving experience, and reputation for dependability. However, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, specifically Android Auto/Apple CarPlay connectivity, and some concerns about the 9-speed transmission's shift quality and reliability.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idling, vibration, and spark plug fouling are all issues caused by the VCM system engaging. The VCM system shuts down cylinders to save fuel, which sometimes leads to the engine burning more oil and experiencing vibrations due to the uneven cylinder activation.
    *   Solution: A VCM disable device (like S-VCM or VCMTuner II) can prevent the system from activating. In some cases, cleaning or replacing spark plugs may temporarily alleviate symptoms. A more permanent fix may involve replacing piston rings, but this is a much more involved repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for a VCM disabler. Spark plug replacement is usually $100-$300. Piston ring replacement is typically $2,000 - $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination, and decreased fuel economy can all be signs of fuel injector failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic check to identify the faulty injector(s), followed by replacement of the malfunctioning fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per injector (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   No Issues Found

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, hard shifts, and general roughness when shifting between gears. This is a common complaint, especially at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A software update from Honda may improve shift quality. In some cases, transmission fluid changes may provide temporary relief. If the problem persists, transmission replacement or rebuild may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for a software update. $150-$300 for a transmission fluid change. $3,000 - $6,000+ for transmission replacement or rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure that leaves the vehicle undriveable.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible fluid leaking from the rear shock absorbers, bouncy ride, and reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ for both rear shocks (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from Honda may resolve the issue. In some cases, a hard reset of the system is required. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for a software update (if performed under warranty or as a service bulletin). $500 - $1500+ for infotainment unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly.
    *   Solution: Ensure all accessories are turned off when the vehicle is not in use. Diagnostic testing to identify parasitic drain if the problem persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for a new battery. Diagnostic testing can range from $75-$150+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate fails to open or close properly, or makes unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Check and lubricate tailgate struts and hinges. Diagnostic check of the tailgate motor and sensors. Replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for lubrication and minor adjustments. $300 - $800+ for motor or sensor replacement (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, black screen, no audio, or inability to play DVDs are all examples of possible RES issues.
    *   Solution: Check the fuse for the RES, reset the system (if possible), or perform a software update (if available). The RES unit may need to be replaced if the problem persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for fuse replacement or software update (if performed under warranty). $500 - $1500+ for RES unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Fan Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning or heating fan blower stops working at all speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HVAC blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Honda Pilot has a reputation for reliability, but owners have reported some issues, particularly with the VCM system leading to excessive oil consumption and vibrations in the 3.5L V6. The 9-speed automatic transmission can also experience rough shifting. Electrical issues like infotainment system freezing and battery drain also arise. Suspension and interior issues are less common but still present. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences that may be resolved with software updates to more costly repairs like transmission replacement or engine work. The estimated cost of these repairs can vary from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, making it important for potential buyers to be aware of these common problems.
