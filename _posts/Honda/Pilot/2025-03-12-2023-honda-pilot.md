**Summary**

The 2023 Honda Pilot generally presents with a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. The most concerning appear to be related to the transmission, specifically harsh shifting, hesitation, and in rare cases, slipping, which can lead to costly repairs. Engine-related problems, like VCM issues causing excessive oil consumption, are also prevalent and can affect the vehicle's long-term reliability. Electrical issues, while less critical, can be frustrating for owners. While many issues can be addressed with software updates or relatively minor repairs, potential transmission or major engine work could incur significant expenses. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, pay close attention to transmission performance during a test drive, and be aware of potential VCM-related issues.
