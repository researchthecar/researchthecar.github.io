The 2014 Honda Pilot is a popular mid-size SUV known for its reliability, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 250 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Pilot for its family-friendliness, ample cargo space, and smooth driving experience. However, some common complaints include the outdated 5-speed transmission, which can feel sluggish compared to newer vehicles with more gears, as well as the fuel economy not being as competitive as some newer SUVs.
