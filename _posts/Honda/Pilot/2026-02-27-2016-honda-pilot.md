### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Honda Pilot generally offers a reliable ownership experience, particularly with the 6-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5L V6 engine is robust, though some owners have encountered issues related to the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system and occasional oil leaks, which are typically manageable. The 9-speed automatic transmission, while offering better fuel economy, has seen more reports of shifting anomalies and potential leaks, often addressed by software updates or fluid services. Electrical gremlins, primarily concerning the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Overall, the Pilot remains a strong contender in its segment, with most reported issues being repairable and not indicative of systemic failure across the entire model range.
