### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Honda Pilot is a generally reliable SUV, especially considering its age. The V6 engine and drivetrain are known for their durability, though routine maintenance like timing belt replacement is crucial. Common issues tend to be related to wear and tear on suspension components, and some electrical gremlins like alternator failure or power window issues can arise. Transmission problems, particularly with the torque converter, are not unheard of but often stem from neglected fluid changes. Exterior issues like fading paint and interior quirks such as HVAC resistor failures are also documented. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing these specific potential problems, the 2003 Pilot remains a solid choice for a used SUV.
