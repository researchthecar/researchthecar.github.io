The 2010 Honda Accord Crosstour is a unique vehicle that blends sedan and SUV characteristics. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 192 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 delivering 271 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5L V6 used a 5-speed automatic in front-wheel-drive models and an all-wheel-drive version was available. Owners often appreciate the Crosstour's comfortable ride, spacious cargo area, and Honda reliability. However, some dislike its unconventional styling and limited rear visibility.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

No Issues Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idle, misfires, and spark plug fouling due to the VCM system. The VCM system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy, but this can lead to uneven wear and oil blow-by.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices or replace the VCM actuator. Address any fouled spark plugs or misfires with appropriate replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the extent of damage and chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (2.4L and 3.5L FWD Models)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Can also cause hesitation or slipping during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (3.5L AWD Models)**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the rear suspension, bouncy ride, and reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Honda Accord Crosstour, while generally reliable, does exhibit some common issues. The VCM system on the V6 engine can lead to oil consumption issues, and torque converter problems can arise in the 5-speed automatic transmissions. Suspension and electrical problems can occur but are not extremely common. Overall, the potential costs for repairs range from relatively minor (hatch struts, sunroof drains) to more significant (transmission rebuild, VCM repair), so prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues.
