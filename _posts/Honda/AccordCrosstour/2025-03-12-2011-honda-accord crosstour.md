The 2011 Honda Accord Crosstour is a unique crossover vehicle that blends the practicality of an SUV with the styling of a hatchback. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 192 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 engine producing 271 hp and 254 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5L engine came with a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Crosstour for its comfortable ride, spacious cargo area, and Honda reliability. Criticisms frequently cited its polarizing styling, limited rear visibility, and the fuel economy not being as good as a standard Accord sedan.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil changes or top-offs between changes. This can manifest as a low oil warning light or visible smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the entire engine may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VCM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can lead to excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, and engine vibrations. This may be more prevalent in early production years.
    *   Solution: Disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices can mitigate the issues. Replacing fouled spark plugs is also necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for VCM disabler) + $50 - $150 (for spark plugs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Transmission Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or rough shifting, particularly between gears. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds or during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush with Honda genuine ATF-DW1 fluid can sometimes resolve the issue. In other cases, valve body issues or worn clutches may necessitate a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid flush) to $2,000 - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Weakness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension may sag over time, especially if frequently loaded with cargo. This can result in a lower ride height and a less comfortable ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and/or springs can restore the proper ride height and improve ride quality. Air suspension models (if equipped) may have leaks or compressor issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can occur if the vehicle sits for extended periods. Parasitic drains caused by faulty modules or aftermarket accessories can also be a factor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the source of the parasitic draw is essential. Replacing the battery may be necessary if it has been repeatedly drained.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the cause and components needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Navigation System/Infotainment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the navigation system freezing, malfunctioning, or failing to update properly.
    *   Solution: Resetting the system can sometimes resolve minor glitches. In more severe cases, replacing the navigation unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100+ (for reset/software update) to $500 - $1500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Struts Failing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch struts may weaken over time, causing the hatch to not stay open or to fall closed unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hatch struts is a relatively simple and inexpensive repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks can occur around the sunroof, potentially damaging the interior. Clogged drain tubes are a common cause.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and clearing the sunroof drain tubes can often resolve the issue. In some cases, the sunroof seal may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (for cleaning drains) to $100 - $500+ (for seal replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Honda Accord Crosstour, while generally reliable, has some known issues to be aware of. The most significant issues revolve around the engine, particularly excessive oil consumption in both the 2.4L and 3.5L engines. Transmission hesitation and rough shifting can also occur. While these issues may require costly repairs, other problems such as suspension sag, electrical glitches, and sunroof leaks are generally less expensive to address. Potential buyers should have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase to assess its overall condition and identify any potential problems.
