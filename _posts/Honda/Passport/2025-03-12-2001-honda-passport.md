The 2001 Honda Passport is a mid-size SUV produced by Isuzu for Honda as part of a vehicle-sharing agreement. It's essentially a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo. The 2001 Passport was offered with two engine options: a 2.2L 4-cylinder and a 3.2L V6. The 2.2L engine produced 130 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.2L V6 produced 205 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (only available with the 2.2L engine) and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Passport's off-road capability and relatively simple mechanical design. Common complaints include its dated interior, lackluster fuel economy (especially with the V6), and some reliability concerns stemming from its Isuzu origins.

**Engine**

**2.2L Inline-4**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, especially from the valve cover gasket, rear main seal, and oil pan gasket. Visible oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels are typical symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the location of the leak.

**3.2L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.2L, the 3.2L V6 is prone to oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil pan gasket. The symptoms are also similar: visible oil drips, burning smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $250+ depending on the location of the leak and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, or difficulty starting can be caused by a faulty IAC valve. The valve controls the amount of air entering the engine when idling.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting between gears, hard shifts, or failure to shift at all. This can be due to worn-out clutches, low transmission fluid, or a faulty valve body.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush (if the fluid is dirty) or replace the valve body. More serious cases may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises when driving over bumps, loose steering, uneven tire wear. The front suspension components, including ball joints, control arm bushings, and sway bar links, are common wear items.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints and bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side, depending on the components replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sagging Rear Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. This can lead to a rougher ride and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**

**Summary:**

The 2001 Honda Passport, while appreciated for its ruggedness, faces a number of common issues typical of older vehicles. Engine and transmission problems, primarily leaks and shifting concerns, can range from minor to expensive to fix. Suspension wear is expected, and rust is a significant concern, potentially leading to costly repairs. Electrical and interior issues add to the potential ownership costs. While some issues are minor, others, like severe rust or transmission failure, can be costly and impact the vehicle's reliability and safety. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor in potential repair costs.
