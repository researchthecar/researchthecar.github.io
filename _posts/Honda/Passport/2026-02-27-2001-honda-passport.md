# 2001 Honda Passport

### Overview
The 2001 Honda Passport, a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo, presents a mixed bag of reliability. While generally considered a robust vehicle for its era, particularly in its powertrain, certain areas are more prone to issues than others. Owners often praise its off-road capability and durable frame. However, like many vehicles of this vintage, it's not immune to age-related problems, especially concerning the electrical system and some interior components. Regular maintenance is key to longevity, but specific known issues can impact ownership experience and costs. This analysis focuses on common mechanical and electrical faults reported by owners and technicians, excluding routine maintenance.

### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Honda Passport, while offering a capable platform, requires attention to potential age-related issues. The 3.2L V6 engine is generally reliable but can suffer from significant failures like head gaskets and timing belts, which are costly to repair. Automatic transmission issues are also a concern. Suspension components and common electrical faults like alternators and window regulators are typical for a vehicle of this age. Rust can be a significant problem depending on the climate. Interior components like the HVAC blower and dashboard can also degrade. Despite these potential drawbacks, a well-maintained Passport can still be a dependable SUV, especially if these common issues have been addressed.
