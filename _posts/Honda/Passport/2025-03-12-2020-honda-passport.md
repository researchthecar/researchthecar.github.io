The 2020 Honda Passport is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and off-road capabilities. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Passport's reliability, ample cargo space, and user-friendly technology. Common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's interface, the 9-speed transmission's occasional hesitation, and some wind noise at highway speeds.

**Engine**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, and engine misfires. This is often attributed to the VCM system, which shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Some owners have disabled the VCM system using aftermarket devices. Other solutions may include more frequent oil changes and addressing any underlying issues like worn piston rings. Honda has not offered an official fix, and aftermarket fixes may affect the warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Aftermarket VCM disabler, $100-$200. Engine repairs, $500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.

**Summary:**

The 2020 Honda Passport generally exhibits good reliability, but certain issues are more prevalent. Engine problems related to VCM can lead to costly repairs, and transmission hesitation can be a nuisance. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and minor interior rattles are also common complaints. The severity of these issues varies, and many can be addressed through software updates or minor repairs. However, major repairs like transmission or engine work can be quite expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
