The 2021 Honda Passport is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and capable V6 engine. It appeals to those seeking a blend of on-road comfort and light off-road ability. Owners often praise its reliability and practicality but sometimes criticize its fuel economy and somewhat bland styling. The 2021 Passport is offered with only one engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. It is paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**

    *   Solution: Some owners have reported success using aftermarket devices to disable the VCM system. Others have addressed oil consumption with more frequent oil changes or by using specific oil additives. A more involved solution could involve replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (VCM Disabler) - $3000+ (Piston Ring Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
