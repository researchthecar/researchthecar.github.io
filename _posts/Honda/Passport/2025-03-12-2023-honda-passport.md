The 2023 Honda Passport is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and off-road capabilities. It comes standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is available. People generally appreciate the Passport for its reliability, practicality, and roomy cargo area. Common complaints include its somewhat bland styling and lower fuel economy compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, rough idling, vibrations, and potential spark plug fouling on cylinders that are deactivated by the VCM system. Owners report these issues can become more prevalent over time.
    * Solution: Disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices or software tunes is a common workaround, though it may void the warranty. Some owners have had success with dealer-performed software updates, but this is not always a permanent fix. More intensive repairs may involve replacing piston rings or other engine components, but this is less common.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 (VCM disabler device), $500 - $1,500+ (engine repairs, if needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Occasional reports of fuel injector issues leading to rough running, misfires, and potential check engine lights.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per injector, depending on labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough shifting, hesitation, or clunking noises, particularly during low-speed maneuvers or when shifting between gears.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update or transmission fluid change may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid change/software update), $1,000 - $3,000+ (valve body/transmission replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some reports of torque converter shudder or vibration, especially at lower speeds. This is less common than the shifting issues.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission flush and fluid change can help. If the problem persists, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system freezes, touchscreen unresponsiveness, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and issues with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration.
    * Solution: Software updates are usually the first step in resolving these issues. Sometimes a system reset is necessary. In rare cases, hardware replacement might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $100 - $300 (diagnostic/reset), $500+ (hardware replacement, if needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly.
    * Solution: Checking for parasitic draws, ensuring the battery is properly charged, and replacing the battery if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (diagnostic), $150 - $300 (battery replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Automatic Tailgate Malfunctions**

    * Solution: Checking the sensors for obstructions, resetting the system, or replacing the tailgate struts or motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (sensor/reset), $300 - $800+ (struts/motor replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of rattling or squeaking noises coming from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    * Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and tightening or lubricating the affected components. This often requires trial and error and may involve removing and reinstalling interior panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the repair).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Honda Passport, while generally reliable, has some potential issues to be aware of. Engine issues, particularly related to the VCM system and potential excessive oil consumption, can be a concern. The 9-speed automatic transmission can also exhibit rough shifting issues. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and battery drain are other areas to watch out for. The cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific problem, ranging from relatively inexpensive software updates to more costly engine or transmission work. While most issues are not major, awareness of these potential problems can help buyers make informed decisions and potentially negotiate better deals.
