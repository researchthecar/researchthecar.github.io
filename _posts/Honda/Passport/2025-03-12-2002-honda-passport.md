The 2002 Honda Passport, a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo, offers a blend of SUV practicality and Honda reliability (or the perception thereof). It was available with a 3.2L V6 engine producing 190 horsepower and 193 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its off-road capability and relatively simple mechanicals for the time. Common dislikes include the dated styling, fuel economy, and the fact that it's not a "true" Honda in terms of engineering and manufacturing.

**Engine**

**3.2L V6 (6VE1)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly develop from various locations including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is required. This can involve significant labor depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.2L V6 is an interference engine. If the timing belt breaks, severe engine damage can occur (bent valves, damaged pistons). Symptoms include sudden engine stall, inability to start, and loud knocking noises.
    *   Solution: Regular timing belt replacement is crucial (every 60,000 - 90,000 miles is recommended). If the belt breaks, extensive engine repair or replacement will be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+ (timing belt replacement) / $2000 - $5000+ (engine repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic idling, stalling, especially at low speeds or when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4L30E)**

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4L30E transmission (manufactured by Aisin) can develop slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, or complete loss of drive. This is often due to worn clutches or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush *may* temporarily alleviate symptoms, but a rebuild or replacement is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) / $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Upper Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The upper ball joints are prone to wear and failure. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the upper ball joints (often sold as an assembly with the upper control arm).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lower ball joints are prone to wear and failure. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the lower ball joints (often sold as an assembly with the lower control arm).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Honda Passport, while sharing Honda's reputation for reliability, has its share of common issues. Engine oil leaks, timing belt maintenance, and transmission problems with the 4L30E are major concerns that can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and idler arms are also prone to wear and can affect handling and safety. Rust is another prevalent issue, especially in certain climates. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be expensive to address, making a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing this vehicle.
