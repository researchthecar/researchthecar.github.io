## 2000 Honda Passport

The 2000 Honda Passport was available with a 3.2-liter V6 engine and a 4-speed automatic transmission. The V6 produced 205 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Motor Trend called the Passport "sprightly" and easy to live with on a daily basis. However, the Passport's rugged off-road capability could come at the expense of on-road refinement, as noted by Car and Driver.
