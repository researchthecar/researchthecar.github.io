The 2008 Honda Ridgeline is a mid-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, innovative features like the in-bed trunk, and its unibody construction. All 2008 Ridgelines come equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 247 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its car-like handling and versatility, but some criticize its towing capacity compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks and its fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **Vibration and Excessive Noise at Idle**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable vibration and rough idling, accompanied by unusual noises from the engine, especially when the vehicle is stopped or idling.
    * Solution: The most common cause of this issue is worn or fouled engine mounts. Replacing the engine mounts will reduce the vibrations.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Check Engine Light with Variable Timing System (VTEC) Codes**
    * Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and a diagnostic scan reveals codes related to the VTEC system (e.g., P2646, P2647). This can lead to reduced engine power and poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacing the VTEC solenoid valve or cleaning the VTEC oil control valve may resolve the issue. In some cases, an oil change with the correct oil viscosity is sufficient.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates or shifts roughly between gears. This is more noticeable in the lower gears.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush may improve the situation. If the problem persists, valve body replacement might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Torque converter shudder is a common complaint with the 5-Speed Honda/Acura transmission.
