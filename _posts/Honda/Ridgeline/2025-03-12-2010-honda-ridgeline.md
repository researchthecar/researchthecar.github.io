The 2010 Honda Ridgeline is a unique pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and innovative features like the in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate. All 2010 Ridgelines came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its car-like handling and utility, but some dislike its unconventional styling and lower towing capacity compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, and engine misfires, particularly in models with the VCM-2 system. This occurs when the system deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy, leading to uneven wear and oil seepage past the piston rings. The Check Engine Light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices or software modifications. More extensive repairs may involve replacing piston rings or addressing valve seal issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+ for disabling VCM; $1500 - $4000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can degrade and potentially break, leading to severe engine damage. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, and eventually a complete engine shutdown.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt, water pump, and tensioner as a preventative measure. Honda recommends replacement every 105,000 miles or 7 years.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. The transmission may also slip or fail to shift properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or rebuilding the transmission. Ensure proper ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) is used (Honda ATF-Z1 or DW-1).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, or a Check Engine Light indicating a transmission-related code.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling stability and uneven tire wear may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks. The door may not lock or unlock with the remote or the interior switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, slow engine cranking, and eventually a dead battery. A Check Engine Light may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Quarter Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the rear quarter panels, particularly around the wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Repairing and repainting the affected areas, or replacing the panels if the rust is severe. Addressing the underlying cause of the rust (e.g., poor drainage).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging or Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors droop down or break at the pivot point, making them ineffective.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per visor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Honda Ridgeline has some potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine, particularly the VCM system and timing belt, and the transmission's torque converter. Suspension and electrical problems are also common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive (e.g., sun visor replacement), others, such as engine piston ring replacement or transmission rebuilds, can be quite expensive. Overall, pre-purchase inspection is very important to determine the condition of the car.
