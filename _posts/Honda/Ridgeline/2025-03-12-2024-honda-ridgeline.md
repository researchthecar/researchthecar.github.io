Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints related to the 2024 Honda Ridgeline, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2024 Honda Ridgeline stands out as a unique pickup truck, offering car-like handling and a comfortable ride thanks to its independent rear suspension and unibody construction. It comes exclusively with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Ridgeline's spacious cabin, innovative bed features like the in-bed trunk, and its overall practicality. However, some common complaints include the truck's somewhat limited towing capacity compared to traditional body-on-frame pickups, and the lack of available engine or transmission options.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2024 Honda Ridgeline generally enjoys a reputation for reliability. However, some owners have reported issues with the fuel injectors in the engine, which can be a moderate expense. Transmission issues can also occur, especially harsh shifting, and the cost can be very high if a replacement is required. The electrical and suspension issues are typically less severe and expensive to address, while interior and exterior complaints mainly revolve around noises and leaks, which may or may not need to be addressed.
