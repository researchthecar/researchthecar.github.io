## Engine

### 3.5L V6 (J35A7)
**Timing Belt Tensioner**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the front of the engine, especially on startup or at idle. Can lead to premature belt wear if ignored.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the timing belt tensioner and potentially the timing belt itself.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700

**Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) System**
- **Symptoms:** Check Engine Light illumination, rough idling, potential oil consumption issues, or misfires in specific cylinders.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and repair or replacement of VCM-related components such as oil control valves, spark plugs, or engine mounts. Sometimes requires software updates.
- **Cost:** $300 - $900


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Automatic (BDCA)
**Torque Converter Shudder**
- **Symptoms:** Vibration or shuddering felt during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds or when the transmission is shifting between gears.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid flush and refill with the correct Honda-specific fluid. In more severe cases, torque converter replacement may be necessary.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1500


## Suspension

### Independent Front Suspension / Multi-link Rear Suspension
**Front Sway Bar Links**

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Honda Ridgeline generally exhibits good reliability, with its 3.5L V6 engine and automatic transmission being robust. Common issues tend to be minor and related to specific components like the timing belt tensioner, VCM system, or torque converter shudder, which are not uncommon for vehicles of this age and mileage. Suspension components, particularly sway bar links, can also wear. Electrical issues are infrequent but can include power window failures. Exterior and interior components are largely trouble-free, with occasional reports of tailgate latch or HVAC resistor issues. Overall, the Ridgeline remains a dependable choice, but owners should be aware of these potential repair areas.
