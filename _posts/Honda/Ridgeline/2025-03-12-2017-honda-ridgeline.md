The 2017 Honda Ridgeline is a unique mid-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and innovative features like the in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate. All 2017 Ridgelines came equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Ridgeline's car-like handling and fuel efficiency for a truck, but some dislike its limited towing capacity compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks and its unconventional styling.
