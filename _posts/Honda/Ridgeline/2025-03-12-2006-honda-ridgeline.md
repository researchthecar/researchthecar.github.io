The 2006 Honda Ridgeline marked Honda's entry into the pickup truck market. It came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 247 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Known for its comfortable ride, innovative in-bed trunk, and dual-action tailgate, the Ridgeline was popular for its practicality. However, some owners have reported issues ranging from minor inconveniences to more significant mechanical problems. Common complaints often revolve around rust, particularly in areas prone to salt exposure, and certain electrical components. Some dislike the truck's unconventional styling and limited towing capacity compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks.
