The 2009 Honda Ridgeline is a unique pickup truck known for its car-like ride and innovative features like the in-bed trunk. All 2009 Ridgelines came with a single engine and transmission option: a 3.5L V6 engine producing 247 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Ridgeline for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and versatility. However, some dislike its truck-like gas mileage and limited towing capacity compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **VCM Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hondaâ€™s Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by shutting down cylinders, is known to cause issues in some Ridgelines. Symptoms include engine misfires, rough idling, and decreased fuel economy. This is often exacerbated by oil leaking past the piston rings on the deactivated cylinders, leading to spark plug fouling.
    * Solution: Some owners have had success disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices. Replacing fouled spark plugs is a temporary fix, but addressing the underlying VCM issue is recommended. A more permanent solution involves replacing the piston rings on the affected cylinders, if they are leaking.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$3000+ depending on the repair
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Catalytic converters can fail prematurely, leading to poor engine performance, decreased fuel economy, and a check engine light (usually with codes P0420 or P0430).
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty catalytic converter(s). It is recommended to diagnose any underlying engine issues (such as VCM problems or oil consumption) before replacing the catalytic converter to prevent repeat failures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a shuddering or shaking sensation during light acceleration, particularly at highway speeds. This is often attributed to torque converter wear.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid change using Honda's DW-1 fluid is the first step. If the shudder persists, a torque converter replacement may be necessary. In some cases, a full transmission rebuild or replacement may be the most effective solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Shift Flare/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Occasional reports of delayed or harsh shifting between gears. This can sometimes be caused by dirty or degraded transmission fluid or worn shift solenoids.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid change is recommended. If the issue persists, solenoid replacement or a valve body rebuild might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $800+ (solenoid replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear trailing arm bushings are prone to wear and tear, leading to clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also affect handling and stability.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn trailing arm bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Strut Mount Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noises, such as creaking or popping sounds, coming from the front strut mounts.
    * Solution: Strut mount replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Window Defroster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear window defroster may stop working, or only partially function.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the defroster grid or related wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Rear Quarter Panels**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the rear quarter panels, particularly around the wheel wells. This is more prevalent in areas with road salt use.
    * Solution: Rust repair, including cutting out the affected metal, welding in new metal, and repainting.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the severity of the rust
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sun Visor Sagging/Breaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sun visors are known to sag or the plastic clips that hold them in place break.
    * Solution: Sun visor replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Navigation Screen Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The navigation screen may fail to illuminate or display correctly.
    * Solution: Replacement or repair of the navigation unit. This can be expensive and replacements may be hard to find.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Honda Ridgeline has several common issues. The most notable concerns are engine-related, specifically the VCM system causing misfires and premature catalytic converter failure. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter shudder, are also reported. Suspension issues are fairly common as well. While some repairs, like bushing or sun visor replacements, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as addressing VCM issues, rust repair, or transmission replacement, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
