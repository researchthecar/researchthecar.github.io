The 2012 Honda Ridgeline is a unique mid-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and innovative features like the in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate. The Ridgeline only came with one engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Ridgeline's car-like handling, smooth ride, and versatility. However, some dislike its limited towing capacity compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks and its somewhat unconventional styling.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, engine misfires, and rough idling. The VCM system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy, but this can lead to uneven wear and oil leakage past the piston rings on the deactivated cylinders.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices. Replacing the piston rings in the affected cylinders is a more permanent fix. Regular spark plug replacements are recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for VCM disabler device. $2,000 - $4,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Loose or Faulty Gas Cap**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check Engine light illumination. This is a common but minor issue that can occur if the gas cap is not tightened correctly or if the seal is damaged.
    *   Solution: Tighten the gas cap or replace it with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $30
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Transmission Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delay in gear engagement, slipping during acceleration, or hard shifts between gears.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid change. If the problem persists, the transmission may require a more in-depth inspection and repair, potentially involving valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for fluid change. $500 - $1500+ for valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sitting lower than the front, especially when carrying a load or towing. This can be due to worn-out rear springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear springs or add air helper springs to improve load-carrying capacity and ride height.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery dies overnight or after a short period of inactivity. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component or accessory.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Navigation system malfunctions, screen freezing, or inaccurate GPS location.
    *   Solution: Update the navigation system software, or replace the navigation unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for software update. $300 - $1000+ for unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on the Rear Subframe**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature rusting of the vehicle's rear subframe.
    * Solution: Clean and coat with rust inhibitor. Replace subframe if damaged significantly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 for rust inhibitor application. $2000+ for subframe replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dashboard is cracking/splitting/spider-webbing.
    * Solution: Replace dashboard or place dashboard cover over the existing dash.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+ for dash cover. $400 - $1000+ for dash replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Honda Ridgeline, while appreciated for its unique design and comfortable ride, can suffer from issues like VCM-related oil consumption, transmission problems, suspension sag, electrical issues, and cracking dashboards. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with VCM and transmission repairs potentially being the most expensive. The rear subframe rust issue also is a big deal. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle inspected before purchasing.
