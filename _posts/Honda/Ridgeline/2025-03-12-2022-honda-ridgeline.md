Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints related to the 2022 Honda Ridgeline, formatted for your website.

The 2022 Honda Ridgeline is a mid-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and unique features like the in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate. All 2022 Ridgelines come standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its car-like handling and versatility, but some criticize its limited towing capacity compared to body-on-frame rivals and its unconventional styling.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption related to the VCM system, which deactivates cylinders to improve fuel economy. Symptoms include the need to add oil frequently between oil changes, rough idling, and potential catalytic converter damage if left unaddressed. This issue is more prevalent in earlier Honda V6 engines with VCM, but some reports exist for the 2022 Ridgeline.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing VCM-related oil consumption can involve a leak-down test. Some owners have reported success disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices, though this can impact fuel economy. More involved repairs may include replacing piston rings or other internal engine components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with fuel injectors causing rough idling, misfires, and potential catalytic converter damage.
    * Solution: Replacement of the fuel injectors and fuel rail is the recommended fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+ (depending on the repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as jolting, delayed shifts, or reluctance to downshift.
    *   Solution: Some have had success with a software update or transmission control module (TCM) recalibration. In more severe cases, replacement of valve body components or the entire transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5,000+ (depending on the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Weakness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners who frequently tow or haul heavy loads have reported premature sagging or weakness in the rear suspension, leading to reduced ground clearance and a compromised ride.
    *   Solution: Upgrading to aftermarket springs or adding air helper springs can help to address this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the infotainment system freezing, becoming unresponsive, or exhibiting glitches, such as delayed responses or unexpected restarts.
    *   Solution: Performing a hard reset of the system or updating the software to the latest version may resolve the issue. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the battery draining prematurely, especially when the vehicle is left parked for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify parasitic draws is recommended. Potential causes include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (for a new battery); $100 - $500+ (for diagnosing and repairing parasitic draws).

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear seats.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and securing loose components or applying sound-deadening material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) - $200+ (professional repair)

**Summary:** The 2022 Honda Ridgeline appears to have a mix of minor and potentially more serious issues. The VCM oil consumption, transmission shifting problems, and infotainment glitches are the most concerning, as they can lead to costly repairs. While not every Ridgeline will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of them and consider a thorough inspection and extended warranty if possible. The rear suspension sag and bed trunk leaks are generally less severe but can be annoying.
