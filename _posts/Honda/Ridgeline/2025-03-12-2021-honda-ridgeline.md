The 2021 Honda Ridgeline is a mid-size pickup truck known for its unibody construction, refined ride, and comfortable interior. The sole engine option for the 2021 model year is a 3.5-liter V6 engine, producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Ridgeline for its car-like handling, spacious cabin, and innovative features like the in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate. However, some criticisms include its perceived lack of ruggedness compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks and its towing capacity not matching some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption. This is often accompanied by spark plug fouling.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices such as a VCM Tuner. Replacement of spark plugs may be required due to fouling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a VCM disabler, $50-$150+ for spark plug replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or delayed shifting, particularly when cold. This may manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or hesitation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Some dealerships will perform a software update of the TCM (Transmission Control Module) to improve shift quality. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush may help. In more severe cases, internal transmission repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for a software update, $150-$300 for a fluid flush, $3,000+ for transmission repairs/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Restarting the vehicle might temporarily resolve the issue. Some owners have had success with performing a factory reset of the infotainment system. Dealership software updates may also address the problem. In more severe cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for a reset, $100 - $200 for a software update, $500 - $1500+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the vehicle's battery draining overnight or after short periods of inactivity. This can result in difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: A parasitic drain test can identify the source of the drain. The faulty component is then replaced. Common causes include a faulty alternator, door switch, or aftermarket electronics improperly installed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 for diagnostic, $200-$500+ for parts and labor, depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Window Cracking/Shattering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In rare cases, the rear window may crack or shatter spontaneously, particularly in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear window.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Buzzing Sounds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported various rattles and buzzing sounds emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear seats.
    *   Solution: Identifying and isolating the source of the noise, then applying felt tape, foam padding, or tightening loose fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This depends heavily on the source of the noise. It may be a simple DIY fix or require professional diagnosis and repair ($100-$300+).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2021 Honda Ridgeline generally exhibits a good level of reliability, but some common issues include the VCM system leading to oil consumption, rough shifting with the 9-speed transmission, electrical gremlins like infotainment problems and battery drain, and occasional rattling within the interior. While most issues are not catastrophic, the electrical and transmission concerns can be more costly to address. The VCM issue is relatively minor and can be prevented by purchasing a VCM disabler. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase.
