The 2019 Honda Ridgeline is a mid-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and unique unibody construction. All 2019 Ridgelines come standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Ridgeline's car-like handling, refined interior, and in-bed trunk. However, some common complaints include the somewhat bland styling, limited off-road capability compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks, and a higher price point than some competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Variable Timing Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illumination. Often caused by oil sludge buildup affecting the variable timing solenoid's function.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty variable timing solenoid and perform an engine flush to remove any sludge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, reduced fuel economy, and the check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s) and inspection of the fuel rail.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh or delayed shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or delayed shifting between gears. Some owners have reported a noticeable "clunk" when shifting gears, especially from 1st to 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, particularly when accelerating from a stop. Can also manifest as unusual vibrations or noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement or transmission rebuild depending on the severity of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the Ridgeline may sag, especially when carrying loads in the bed or towing. This can affect ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shocks, or installation of helper springs or airbags to provide additional support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Honda Ridgeline generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but owners have reported a range of issues affecting various components. Engine problems like VVT solenoid failures and fuel injector issues can lead to performance problems and costly repairs. The 6-speed transmission can experience harsh shifting and torque converter issues that can be expensive to address. Electrical issues like battery drain and infotainment system glitches can be frustrating. Suspension problems like rear sagging can affect handling and ride quality. Finally, water leaks in the bed trunk can damage items stored inside. While some of these issues are minor, others can lead to significant repair costs, so prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
