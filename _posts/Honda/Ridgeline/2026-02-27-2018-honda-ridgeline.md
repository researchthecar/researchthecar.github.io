### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Honda Ridgeline is a highly reliable vehicle with a strong overall performance. The powertrain, including the V6 engine and the 6-speed automatic transmission, is exceptionally robust. The 9-speed automatic transmission, while generally good, has seen some isolated reports of shifting anomalies that can often be resolved with software updates. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are the most frequently cited, though not widespread. These are typically manageable with diagnostics and software fixes. The suspension, exterior, and interior components have proven durable. For potential buyers, focusing on vehicles with well-maintained electrical systems and ensuring any 9-speed transmission software is up-to-date would be prudent.
