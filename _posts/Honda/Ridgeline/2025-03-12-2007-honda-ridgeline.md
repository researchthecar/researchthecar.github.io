The 2007 Honda Ridgeline is a unique pickup truck known for its car-like ride, comfortable interior, and innovative features like the in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate. It's powered by a 3.5L V6 engine that produces 247 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission and a standard all-wheel-drive system. Owners often praise its versatility, reliability, and smooth driving experience. Common complaints, however, revolve around fuel economy, the relatively small truck bed compared to traditional pickups, and some specific issues that can arise with age and mileage.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VTEC Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC) system may experience solenoid failure, leading to rough idling, decreased power, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty VTEC solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Tube Seals Leaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks into the spark plug tubes, causing misfires, rough running, and potential damage to the ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the spark plug tube seals, along with cleaning or replacement of affected spark plugs and coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Service Needed**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L V6 is an interference engine, so if the timing belt breaks then the engine can be damaged. The timing belt wears out over time and needs to be replaced at regular intervals, recommended every 105,000 miles or 7 years. Symptoms of a failing timing belt can include ticking, rough idling, or no start.
    *   Solution: Complete timing belt replacement including the water pump, tensioner, and pulleys.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or vibration during shifting, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. This is often attributed to worn transmission fluid or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Performing a complete transmission fluid flush with genuine Honda ATF-Z1 or DW-1 fluid. If the issue persists, internal transmission repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush, $2000 - $4000+ for rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushings Worn**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Driver's Power Seat Not Working**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Driver's power seat will not move in one or more directions. This can be due to a faulty switch, motor, or wiring harness.
    *   Solution: Diagnose which component is faulty and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Tail Light Assembly Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appear in the tail light assembly, causing moisture to build up inside. This can cause a short in the lightbulb circuit and cause the bulbs to burn out quicker.
    * Solution: Replace cracked tail light assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting Around Rear Wheel Wells and Bed Seams**

**Summary**

The 2007 Honda Ridgeline is generally considered a reliable vehicle, but like any vehicle of its age, it can be prone to certain issues. Engine problems, such as VTEC solenoid failures and spark plug tube leaks, can impact performance. The transmission may exhibit shuddering issues. Suspension components, like rear trailing arm bushings, can wear out. Rust, particularly in areas exposed to harsh conditions, is also a concern. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others like transmission overhauls or rust repair can be costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
