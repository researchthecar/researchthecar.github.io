Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2014 Honda Ridgeline, organized by category and including the requested details.

The 2014 Honda Ridgeline is a unique pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, car-like handling, and innovative features like the in-bed trunk. It was only offered with one engine and transmission combination, a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Ridgeline's practicality and smooth ride, but some dislike its limited towing capacity compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks and its polarizing styling.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can sometimes cause misfires, rough idling, and vibrations, especially at lower RPMs. This can be due to oil fouling spark plugs in cylinders that deactivate often, or issues with the VCM solenoid.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices or software. Replace fouled spark plugs with updated versions. Clean or replace the VCM solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets/Spool Valve)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from the valve cover gaskets or the VTEC spool valve assembly. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets or the VTEC spool valve assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or delayed shifting, especially between gears. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, low transmission fluid, or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush with Honda Genuine ATF DW-1. In some cases, valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild/replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration can be felt at certain speeds or during light acceleration, often attributed to the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush using Honda Genuine ATF DW-1. Install a new torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $1,000+ (torque converter replacement)

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the rear suspension can sag, especially when carrying heavy loads or towing. This can lead to a rougher ride and reduced ground clearance.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shocks or struts. Install aftermarket air springs or helper springs to assist with load leveling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
