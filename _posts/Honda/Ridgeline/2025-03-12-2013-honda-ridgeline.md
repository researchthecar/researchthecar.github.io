The 2013 Honda Ridgeline is a unique pickup truck known for its unibody construction, comfortable ride, and in-bed trunk. All 2013 Ridgelines came equipped with a single powertrain option: a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Ridgeline's car-like handling, spacious cabin, and innovative features like the dual-action tailgate. Common dislikes include its limited towing capacity compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks and its unconventional styling, which some find less rugged than competitors.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, spark plug fouling, engine misfires, and rough idling. The VCM system shuts down cylinders to improve fuel economy, but can sometimes cause uneven wear and oil burning.
    *   Solution: Disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices, perform a piston ring replacement (expensive), or try using a higher-quality synthetic oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for VCM disabler; $2,000 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt and Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt is a wear item and can break, leading to catastrophic engine damage. The water pump is often replaced at the same time due to its location and potential for failure. Symptoms include engine ticking, squealing, or complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt and water pump as part of scheduled maintenance (typically every 7 years or 105,000 miles).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, particularly when cold. Transmission may slip or hesitate during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush using Honda-approved ATF-DW1 fluid. If the problem persists, inspect the solenoids, valve body, or consider a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush; $500 - $1,000+ for solenoid/valve body repair; $3,000 - $5,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Subframe Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust develops on the rear subframe, which supports the rear suspension components. Excessive rust can weaken the subframe, leading to potential suspension failure and compromised safety.
    *   Solution: Inspect the subframe for rust and apply rust inhibitor. If the rust is severe, the subframe may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for rust inhibitor application; $1,000 - $2,000+ for subframe replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride comfort, excessive bouncing, and poor handling. Visible signs of leakage may be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more power door locks fail to operate properly. The door may not lock or unlock with the remote or the interior switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver Side Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window either does not go up or down, or it gets stuck while going up or down.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window motor
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing around the tailgate seams or hinges.
    *   Solution: Repair rust spots and repaint or replace the tailgate if the corrosion is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+, depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin through the sunroof, especially during heavy rain.
    * Solution: Clean the sunroof drain tubes and ensure proper sealing. The sunroof seal may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for cleaning and sealing; $200-$500+ for seal replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Honda Ridgeline has some common issues, with the most concerning being potential engine problems related to VCM and timing belt failures, and transmission issues. Rear subframe rust is also a significant concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. While electrical and minor cosmetic issues can occur, they are generally less expensive to address. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these problems and ensure proper maintenance has been performed. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them proactively can prevent more expensive repairs down the road.
