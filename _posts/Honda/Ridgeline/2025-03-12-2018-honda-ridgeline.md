The 2018 Honda Ridgeline is a unique mid-size pickup truck known for its car-like ride and handling, spacious interior, and innovative features like the in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate. All 2018 Ridgelines came equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 280 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Ridgeline's comfortable ride, fuel efficiency (for a truck), and versatility. Some common dislikes include its unconventional styling (compared to traditional body-on-frame trucks) and limited off-road capability.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**
* **Variable Timing Control (VTC) Actuator Rattle**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling or grinding noise upon cold start, typically lasting for a few seconds. This is due to the VTC actuator not properly locking into place.
    * Solution: Replacement of the VTC actuator with an updated part. Some dealerships may attempt to reprogram the ECU, but this is often a temporary fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure/Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, fuel smell, and potentially a check engine light. This is caused by a faulty fuel injector leaking or not properly atomizing fuel.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty injector(s), followed by replacement of the injector(s) and potentially cleaning of the fuel rail.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per injector
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**
* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when shifting, especially when downshifting.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other cases, replacing the transmission fluid with genuine Honda ATF can help. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $800 (valve body) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sag/Squat**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than the front, especially when carrying a load or towing. Can lead to poor handling and ride quality.
    * Solution: Installation of aftermarket helper springs or air springs to provide additional support to the rear suspension. Upgrading to stiffer rear shocks can also improve handling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Display Audio System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, Rebooting, Screen Going Black. Bluetooth Connectivity Issues. Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity problems.
    * Solution: Honda released software updates for the display audio system to address some of these issues. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $500 - $1500+ (Head Unit Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or after short periods of inactivity. Difficult or impossible to start the vehicle.
    * Solution: Thoroughly test all components of the charging system. If all is working properly, then test for parasitic draw from aftermarket components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Latch Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult to open or close the tailgate. The dual-action tailgate may not function properly, failing to swing to the side.
    * Solution: Replacement of the tailgate latch mechanism. Lubricating the latch may provide a temporary fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin, particularly around the sunroof. May cause water stains or mold growth.
    * Solution: Cleaning of the sunroof drain tubes. Repairing or replacing the sunroof seal if it is damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (Cleaning) - $200 - $500+ (Seal Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Honda Ridgeline, while generally reliable, has some common issues to watch out for. Engine-related problems, such as the VTC actuator rattle and fuel injector failures, can be costly to repair. The transmission can also experience shifting issues, and the electrical system can have issues with the display audio unit and battery drain. Suspension sag is also a common complaint. While the issues aren't necessarily widespread, potential buyers should be aware of them and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but some repairs can be expensive, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
