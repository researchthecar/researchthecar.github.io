The 2015 Honda CR-Z is a sporty hybrid coupe that aimed to offer a blend of fuel efficiency and driving enjoyment. Powered by a 1.5-liter i-VTEC inline-4 gasoline engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system, it produces a combined 130 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque with the 6-speed manual transmission or 127 lb-ft of torque with the CVT. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate its unique styling, good fuel economy, and engaging handling (especially with the manual transmission), but some criticize its limited rear passenger space, modest power, and firm ride.

**Electric Motor**

**Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) System**

*   **IMA Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced battery capacity leads to decreased fuel economy, less electric assist, and potentially the "IMA" light illuminating on the dashboard. The car may rely more on the gasoline engine, reducing overall performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IMA battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC Inline-4 (LE Type)**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check Engine Light (CEL) with codes indicating catalytic converter inefficiency (e.g., P0420). The vehicle may experience reduced power and increased emissions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, Check Engine Light (CEL). Often triggered by a faulty ignition coil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (per coil)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, high clutch pedal engagement point.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement (including clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Fluid Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leaks, often noticed as red fluid under the vehicle. Can lead to transmission slipping or failure if fluid level is too low.
    * Solution: Replace leaking seals or gaskets, potentially requires transmission removal for access.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the severity of the leak
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, or complete failure of the transmission. Error codes related to transmission pressure or ratio discrepancies. Can exhibit loud whining noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the CVT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, visible oil leaking from the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (for both)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent Bluetooth pairing, dropped connections, difficulty connecting phones.
    *   Solution: Software update for the head unit, or replacement of the Bluetooth module (if necessary).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $300+ (for module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sun visors that do not stay in the upright position and constantly droop down, obstructing the driver's view.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ (per visor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windshield wipers not functioning, or only working intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the windshield wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Honda CR-Z, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to watch out for. The most concerning are potential CVT transmission problems, which can be expensive to fix. IMA battery degradation is also a significant concern given the car's age, though less severe issues like ignition coil failures and sun visor sagging are also present. Repair costs range from relatively minor for small components to several thousand dollars for major items like the CVT or IMA battery.
