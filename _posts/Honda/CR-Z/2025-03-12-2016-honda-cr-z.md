The 2016 Honda CR-Z is a sporty hybrid coupe that aims to blend fuel efficiency with a fun driving experience. It comes equipped with a 1.5-liter inline-4 cylinder engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. This combination produces a combined 130 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque (127 lb-ft with the CVT). It was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its unique styling, fuel economy, and nimble handling, while others find the rear visibility limited, the back seats essentially unusable, and the overall power output underwhelming for a sporty car.

**Electric Motor**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerking, shuddering, or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can manifest as a feeling of the transmission struggling to find the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a CVT fluid change using genuine Honda CVT fluid may help. If that doesn't work, the CVT may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (CVT replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 12V battery draining quickly, especially if the car is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include ensuring all aftermarket accessories are properly installed and not drawing excessive power, checking for parasitic draws, replacing the 12V battery with a high-quality AGM battery, and using a battery maintainer if the car is not driven often.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

* **IMA Battery Degradation/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: As with any hybrid vehicle, the IMA battery pack can degrade over time, leading to reduced fuel economy, decreased power assist, and potential error messages.
    * Solution: Replacement of the IMA battery pack is the common solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Struts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak rear hatch struts can cause the hatch to fall unexpectedly or be difficult to keep open.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors can sag over time, obstructing the driver's view.
    *   Solution: Replace the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Honda CR-Z presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from relatively minor inconveniences like sagging sun visors to more significant concerns such as CVT problems or IMA battery degradation. The CVT issues and IMA battery problems can be expensive to fix, potentially costing several thousand dollars. The other issues are generally less severe and less costly to address. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, paying close attention to the condition of the CVT and hybrid system, and inquire about the maintenance history, especially regarding CVT fluid changes and IMA battery health.
