### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Honda CR-Z is generally a reliable vehicle, particularly for its powertrain when properly maintained. The most significant potential expense lies with the hybrid battery, which has a finite lifespan and can be costly to replace. Issues with the CVT transmission, though not extremely common, can also lead to repair costs. Electrical gremlins, such as 12V battery failures or infotainment system glitches, are also noted. However, the manual transmission variant and other systems like suspension, exterior, and interior components tend to be robust. Regular maintenance, especially for the hybrid system and transmission fluid, is crucial for maximizing the longevity and reliability of the CR-Z.
