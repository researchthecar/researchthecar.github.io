The 2011 Honda CR-Z is a sporty hybrid coupe that was intended to blend fuel efficiency with fun driving dynamics. It features a 1.5L i-VTEC inline-4 cylinder engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. This powertrain produces a combined 122 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the CR-Z for its unique styling, sporty handling, and good fuel economy, while criticisms often center around its limited rear passenger space, modest power output, and firm ride.

**Electric Motor**

**Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)**

* **IMA Battery Degradation/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) battery pack degrades over time, leading to reduced electric assist, decreased fuel economy, and potential error codes related to the hybrid system. The "Check Engine" light or IMA light may illuminate on the dashboard. Performance issues may include a loss of power during acceleration.
    * Solution: Replacing the IMA battery pack can restore the hybrid system to optimal performance. Some owners opt for refurbished battery packs or individual cell replacements to reduce costs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC Inline-4 Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Symptoms may include a noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick, blue smoke from the exhaust, and the potential for engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and add oil as needed. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary, which can be costly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$50 (oil) $1000-$4000+ (major repairs/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ignition Coil Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ignition coils can fail, leading to misfires, rough idling, and a decrease in engine performance. The "Check Engine" light may illuminate, and diagnostic codes will indicate which cylinder is misfiring.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil. It is often recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time to ensure consistent performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

* **CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report CVT transmission failures, leading to slipping, hesitation, and overall poor performance. Symptoms may include unusual noises, difficulty shifting, and the inability to accelerate properly.
    * Solution: Replacing the CVT transmission is generally the recommended solution. Ensure the replacement transmission is properly calibrated to the vehicle's hybrid system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers can lead to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially on uneven surfaces. Owners may notice excessive body roll during cornering or increased noise from the rear suspension.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, leading to condensation that reduces visibility and potentially damages the headlight bulbs and components.
    * Solution: The headlight housings can be resealed to prevent moisture from entering. In some cases, replacing the entire headlight assembly may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The door lock actuators can fail, causing the doors to not lock or unlock properly. This can be a security concern and a general inconvenience.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracking in the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight and heat.
    * Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Paint Peeling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported paint peeling, particularly on the roof and hood of the vehicle.
    * Solution: Repainting the affected areas is the recommended solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2011 Honda CR-Z has some notable issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the IMA battery and CVT transmission, which can lead to costly repairs. Other issues such as oil consumption, electrical problems, and suspension component failures also require attention. When considering a 2011 CR-Z, it's important to have the vehicle thoroughly inspected, paying close attention to the condition of the hybrid system and transmission. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them can ensure the vehicle remains reliable and enjoyable to drive.
