Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2012 Honda CR-Z, formatted for your website.

The 2012 Honda CR-Z is a sporty hybrid coupe that aimed for fuel efficiency and a fun driving experience. It's powered by a 1.5-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. This combination produces 130 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque (combined). The CR-Z was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the CR-Z's unique styling, fuel economy, and engaging handling, especially with the manual transmission. Common dislikes include limited rear passenger space, a somewhat stiff ride, and acceleration that some find lacking compared to a traditional sports car.

**Electric Motor**

**Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)**

*   **IMA Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual decrease in hybrid battery capacity, leading to reduced fuel economy and IMA system malfunction. The "Check IMA System" warning light illuminates on the dashboard. Can also cause the vehicle to run in limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IMA battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DC-DC Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DC-DC converter is responsible for converting the high-voltage DC power from the IMA battery pack to the low-voltage DC power needed to run the vehicle's accessories, lights, and other electrical systems. A failing converter can cause symptoms such as the vehicle not starting, the battery not charging, or the electrical systems malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the DC-DC Converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, and a burning smell during clutch engagement. The clutch disc wears out prematurely due to the hybrid system's torque delivery characteristics.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and potentially the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Jerky acceleration, hesitation, slipping between gears, and a whining noise from the transmission. Can also lead to complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the CVT.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and a clunking noise from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent Bluetooth pairing, difficulty connecting phones, and dropped calls.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the Bluetooth module in the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks. Doors may not lock or unlock with the key fob or interior switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windshield wipers not working at all or only working intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the windshield wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard material, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ for replacement, $50 - $200+ for a cover
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Honda CR-Z, while a unique and fuel-efficient hybrid coupe, can suffer from issues primarily related to its hybrid system (IMA battery), CVT (if equipped), and electrical components. The IMA battery replacement is the most expensive potential repair. Owners should be aware of potential clutch wear (on manual transmission models) and suspension component failures. Overall, the CR-Z's reliability is generally considered good, but these specific issues should be considered when evaluating a used model.
