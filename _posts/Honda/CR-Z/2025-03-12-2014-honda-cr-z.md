The 2014 Honda CR-Z is a sporty hybrid hatchback that was offered with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. This combination produced around 130 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque (slightly less for CVT models). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the CR-Z's unique styling, sporty handling, and fuel efficiency, while some criticize its limited rear passenger space and relatively modest power output.
