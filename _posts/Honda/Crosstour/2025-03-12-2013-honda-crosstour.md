The 2013 Honda Crosstour is a somewhat polarizing vehicle, known for its unique, wagon-like design that blends elements of a sedan and an SUV. It offered two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 192 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 278 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5L came with a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Crosstour's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and practicality, but some criticize its unconventional styling and limited rear visibility. Common complaints often revolve around electrical issues and some concerns with the V6 engine.
