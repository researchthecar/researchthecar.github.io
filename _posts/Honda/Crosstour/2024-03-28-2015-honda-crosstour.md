**Introduction:**

The 2015 Honda Crosstour is a midsize crossover SUV that combines the versatility of an SUV with the sleekness of a sedan. It is available with two engine options: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 192 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 with 278 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a six-speed automatic or a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

The Crosstour is praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and impressive fuel economy. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of off-road capabilities and its somewhat bland styling.
