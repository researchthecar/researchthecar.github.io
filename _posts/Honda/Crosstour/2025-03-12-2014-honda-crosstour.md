Here's a breakdown of common issues reported by owners of the 2014 Honda Crosstour, categorized and formatted as requested. The 2014 Honda Crosstour is a unique crossover vehicle that blends aspects of a sedan and an SUV. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 192 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 278 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. The inline-4 was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 came with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and practicality, but some dislike its polarizing styling and limited cargo space compared to traditional SUVs.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2.4L engines consume an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and catalytic converter failure.
    *   Solution: Honda extended the warranty and offered a software update to address this issue. Some owners have had to replace piston rings or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VCM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can sometimes cause vibrations, rough idling, and oil fouling of spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Some owners disable the VCM system using aftermarket devices or modify the engine control unit (ECU) programming. Others have had to replace spark plugs more frequently.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging/Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the rear suspension of their Crosstour tends to sag over time, especially when carrying heavy loads. This can lead to a bumpy ride and reduced ground clearance. Some have also noted creaking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks or springs. Some owners have upgraded to aftermarket springs or air suspension systems to improve ride height and load-carrying capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of batteries draining prematurely, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can make it difficult to start the car, especially in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing any parasitic drain sources. Common culprits include the radio, hands-free phone system, and improperly installed aftermarket accessories. Replacing the battery with a higher-capacity unit can also help.

    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door lock actuators. The door may not lock or unlock with the remote or interior switch.
