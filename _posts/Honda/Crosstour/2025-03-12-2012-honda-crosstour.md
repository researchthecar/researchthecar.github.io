The 2012 Honda Crosstour is a unique vehicle, blending SUV versatility with a car-like driving experience. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 192 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5L V6 generating 278 hp and 252 lb-ft of torque. The 4-cylinder engine is paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 utilizes a 5-speed automatic in front wheel drive and all wheel drive variants. Owners often praise its comfortable ride and ample cargo space, but some find the exterior styling polarizing and complain about limited rear visibility.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored and corrected. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Honda released a service bulletin and extended warranty coverage for piston ring replacement on certain 2012 models. Check vehicle's VIN for eligibility for warranty repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of damage and if performed outside of warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

* **Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, vibrations, and decreased fuel economy due to the VCM system engaging and disengaging cylinders. Can also cause spark plug fouling on the deactivated cylinders, leading to misfires.
    * Solution: Installation of a VCM disabler device, which prevents the VCM system from activating. This may void the warranty, and is not an official Honda repair, but will address the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for the VCM disabler device. A malfunctioning VCM solenoid or cylinder deactivation system might require more extensive repairs, costing $500 - $1000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil loss, burning oil smell, and potential damage to other engine components.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (Both 2.4L and 3.5L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. Sometimes accompanied by a clunking noise.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid change using genuine Honda ATF-DW1 fluid. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be required, potentially leading to valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for a fluid change; $500 - $1500+ for valve body repair or replacement, if needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, particularly when loaded or after a long period of time. This can affect handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and/or springs. Some owners upgrade to heavier-duty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for shocks and springs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery draining overnight or over a few days, leading to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic drain. This could be caused by a faulty module, relay, or aftermarket accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation System/Display Screen Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The navigation system freezing, glitching, or the display screen going blank.
    *   Solution: Updating the navigation system software. If the problem persists, the navigation unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for software updates (if available); $500 - $1500+ for navigation unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch not staying open on its own, requiring manual support.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150

    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin from the sunroof, particularly during heavy rain.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof drains. If the problem persists, the sunroof seal may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for drain cleaning; $100 - $300+ for seal replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Honda Crosstour has a mix of potential issues, with the most concerning being engine-related, particularly excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L and VCM issues in the 3.5L. Transmission issues such as harsh shifting, and suspension problems like rear sagging, are also present but occur at a lower frequency. Electrical glitches and sunroof leaks round out the list of potential problems. The severity ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Addressing these issues proactively through regular maintenance and prompt repairs can help prolong the vehicle's lifespan and maintain its reliability.
