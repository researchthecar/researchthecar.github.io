The 2015 Honda Crosstour is a versatile vehicle that blends the styling of a hatchback with the functionality of a crossover. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 192 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 generating 278 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 came with a 6-speed automatic. People generally appreciated the Crosstour for its comfortable ride, spacious cargo area, and unique styling. Common complaints included the polarizing exterior design, limited rear visibility, and fuel economy that wasn't as good as some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between regular service intervals. Symptoms may include the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running rough.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Honda has issued service bulletins regarding oil consumption and piston ring issues. The recommended fix can involve replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **VCM (Variable Cylinder Management) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VCM system, designed to improve fuel economy by deactivating cylinders, can sometimes cause vibrations, rough idling, and increased oil consumption. In severe cases, it may lead to fouled spark plugs due to inactive cylinders.
    *   Solution: Disabling the VCM system using aftermarket devices or software modifications is a common solution. Some owners also report success with replacing spark plugs more frequently.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (for VCM disabler); $100 - $500+ (for spark plug replacement depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.5L V6)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a shuddering sensation during light acceleration, often between 30-50 mph. This is typically attributed to torque converter issues.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid change with genuine Honda ATF may help temporarily. The ultimate fix may be torque converter replacement or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 (for fluid change), $800 - $2,000+ (for torque converter replacement), $3,000+ (for transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed that the rear suspension sags over time, particularly when carrying cargo or passengers in the back. This can lead to a reduced ride height and potentially affect handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and springs can restore the ride height and improve handling. Air suspension upgrades may be available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain causing the vehicle to not start, especially after sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty sensor, module, or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the parasitic draw. Common culprits are the HandsFreeLink module, door actuators, or aftermarket alarms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HandsFreeLink/Bluetooth Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent connectivity issues with the HandsFreeLink Bluetooth system. Symptoms can include difficulty pairing devices, dropped calls, and the system failing to recognize previously paired devices.
    *   Solution: Updating the HandsFreeLink software, or replacing the module itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update, if available and covered), $200 - $500+ (for module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin during rain, typically around the sunroof area. This is often due to clogged sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear windshield wiper stops working. The motor is usually the problem.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Honda Crosstour, while generally reliable, can experience issues with engine oil consumption (particularly the 2.4L), VCM-related problems in the 3.5L V6, and torque converter shudder with the 6-speed automatic transmission. Electrical gremlins like battery drain and HandsFreeLink issues also pop up. While the severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs, being aware of these common complaints can help prospective buyers make informed decisions and budget accordingly. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the chosen repair shop, but potential buyers should be prepared for expenses ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand for more significant problems like engine or transmission work.
