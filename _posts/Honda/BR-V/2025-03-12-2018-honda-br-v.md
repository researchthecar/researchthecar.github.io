The 2018 Honda BR-V is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its spacious interior (especially its third-row seating, which is rare in its class), fuel efficiency, and affordability. The engine option for the 2018 BR-V is a 1.5L i-VTEC inline-four cylinder producing around 118 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. This engine is available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the BR-V's practical nature, fuel economy, and family-friendly features. Common dislikes revolve around its somewhat underpowered engine and basic interior trim.

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can be indicated by the low oil level warning light illuminating or noticeable smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. In some cases, a PCV valve replacement or a more extensive engine repair (piston rings) may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (PCV valve), $1,000 - $3,000+ (engine repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, reduced power, and a check engine light may illuminate. A diagnostic scan will reveal a code related to a specific cylinder's misfire.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (per coil, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **Juddering/Shaking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a juddering or shaking sensation, particularly during low-speed acceleration or when climbing hills. This can be caused by CVT fluid degradation or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid flush using genuine Honda CVT fluid. If the problem persists, further inspection and possible CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (CVT fluid flush), $3,000 - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Can also lead to vague steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per bushing/set of bushings, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days. Can be caused by a parasitic drain (a component drawing power even when the car is off) or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Identify and repair any parasitic drains. Replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (battery), $100 - $500+ (diagnosing and fixing parasitic drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Airbag Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light illuminating. A diagnostic scan reveals an error code related to an airbag sensor malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty airbag sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or buzzing sounds coming from the dashboard area, particularly on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle (loose trim pieces, wiring harnesses) and secure them with foam padding or clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ (depending on whether it's a DIY fix or professional repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Honda BR-V generally proves to be a reliable vehicle. However, it's crucial to be aware of the potential for excessive oil consumption (engine), CVT juddering (CVT), premature bushing wear (suspension), battery drain issues, faulty airbag sensors (electrical), and rattling dashboards (interior). The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with some repairs being relatively inexpensive (e.g., replacing a PCV valve or a bushing) while others, such as CVT or engine replacements, can be significantly more costly. Proactive maintenance, such as regular oil changes and CVT fluid flushes, can help mitigate some of these potential problems. Before purchasing a used 2018 BR-V, it is wise to have it inspected by a qualified mechanic to identify any pre-existing issues.
