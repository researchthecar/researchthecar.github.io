The 2021 Honda BR-V is a subcompact crossover SUV primarily sold in Asian markets. The most common engine option is a 1.5-liter i-VTEC inline-four gasoline engine, producing around 118 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. It is offered with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). People generally appreciate the BR-V for its fuel efficiency, spacious cabin, and seven-seat configuration in a small package. Common dislikes include its somewhat underpowered engine, basic interior materials, and relatively unrefined driving experience.
