The 2019 Honda BR-V is a subcompact crossover SUV primarily sold in Asian markets. In the Philippines, for example, it was offered with a 1.5L i-VTEC engine producing around 118 hp and 107 lb-ft of torque. It came with either a 6-speed manual or a CVT transmission. Owners generally liked the BR-V for its spacious interior, especially the third-row seating, making it suitable for families. However, some disliked its relatively basic interior and somewhat underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded.
