The 2021 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. The standard engine is a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 190 horsepower and 179 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). A hybrid powertrain is also available, combining a 2.0L inline-4 with an electric motor. Owners generally praise the CR-V for its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and user-friendly technology. Common complaints include lackluster acceleration with the base engine, and the CVT transmission feeling sluggish.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel mixes with engine oil, leading to a gasoline smell in the oil, increased oil level, and potential engine damage due to reduced lubrication. This issue is more prevalent in colder climates and during short trips. Owners may notice the oil level rising above the full mark on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Honda has issued a software update to recalibrate the fuel injection system and improve engine warm-up. In some cases, oil changes and even replacement of the fuel injectors may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically free. Fuel injector replacement can range from $400 - $800+ depending on the shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Juddering/Shaking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing juddering or shaking, particularly during low-speed acceleration or when climbing hills. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or hesitating.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other instances, a CVT fluid change may be necessary. In severe cases, a complete transmission replacement might be required.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component that is not shutting off properly.
    *   Solution: Dealership inspection to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Possible solutions include replacing the battery, fixing faulty wiring, or replacing the malfunctioning electrical component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement: $150 - $300. Parasitic draw diagnosis and repair: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found
* **Malfunctioning Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Screen freezes, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and random system resets.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Honda may resolve the issue. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: Free. Head unit replacement: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Automatic Braking System False Activation**
  * Description/Symptoms: Automatic braking system activates randomly without warning, causing the vehicle to brake suddenly.
  * Solution: Have the sensor for the automatic braking system inspected by the dealership. It might need to be recalibrated or replaced if there is an issue.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: System recalibration $100 - $300+. System replacement can range from $500 - $1200+

    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and applying felt tape or foam padding to dampen the vibrations. In some cases, tightening loose trim pieces may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2021 Honda CR-V, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most concerning is the potential for excessive oil dilution with the 1.5L turbo engine, which can lead to engine damage if not addressed. CVT transmission issues and electrical problems are also noteworthy. The severity of these issues varies, with some being relatively minor fixes (software updates, fluid changes) while others can be more costly (transmission/engine repair or replacement). Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure the vehicle has been properly maintained and any recalls or service bulletins have been addressed.
