The 2010 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It came equipped with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 180 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CR-V for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reputation for longevity. However, some common complaints include the somewhat dated infotainment system for its time, the 5-speed automatic can feel dated compared to newer 6-8+ speed transmissions in other cars, and potential for road noise.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.4L engine consuming more oil than expected, especially at higher mileage. This can lead to the need for frequent oil top-offs and, if left unchecked, potential engine damage. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating, a burning oil smell, and visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Regularly check oil levels and top off as needed. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic can perform a compression test and leak-down test to determine the source of the oil loss. Depending on the cause, the solution might range from replacing valve stem seals to piston ring replacement or a complete engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil top-offs) - $3000+ (engine rebuild).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VTC Actuator Rattle**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start, particularly noticeable in colder weather. This is often attributed to the Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator. This issue is usually short-lived, only occurring for a second or two after starting.
    * Solution: Replacement of the VTC actuator. The updated part design is meant to mitigate the rattle.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. Some also experience a brief hesitation on acceleration.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush using genuine Honda ATF-DW1 fluid can sometimes resolve minor shifting issues. In more severe cases, valve body issues or other internal damage might require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sag/Squeaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Due to age and mileage, the rear suspension can sag, leading to a lower ride height in the rear and potential bottoming out on bumps. Squeaking noises from the rear suspension are also common.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and/or springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power door locks may fail to operate consistently, or stop working entirely, on one or more doors.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350 per door
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or unexplained battery drain, often traced to parasitic draws from electrical components.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This can involve testing individual circuits and components to identify the faulty item. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a malfunctioning audio system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rear Hatch Latch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch latch mechanism can become sticky or fail entirely, making it difficult to open or close the hatch.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear hatch latch assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sun Visor Sagging/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sun visors may become loose and sag, failing to stay in the upright position.
    * Solution: Replacing the sun visor(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per visor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Honda CR-V, while generally reliable, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues such as excessive oil consumption and VTC actuator rattle are possible, especially at higher mileage. Transmission issues can also arise, although these are less frequent. Suspension, electrical, and exterior problems, like rear suspension sag, door lock actuator failure, and rear hatch latch issues, are also reported. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs. Overall, it's important to have a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the condition of these potential problem areas.
