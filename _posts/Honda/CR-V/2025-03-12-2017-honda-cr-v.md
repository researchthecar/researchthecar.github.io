The 2017 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. It offers two engine options: a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 delivering 190 horsepower and 179 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the CR-V's comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and standard safety features. Common dislikes include the sometimes-noisy CVT, infotainment system quirks, and some reports of oil dilution issues with the 1.5T engine.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Oil Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel mixes with the engine oil, leading to a rising oil level, a gasoline smell in the oil, and potential engine damage. This is more prevalent in colder climates and during frequent short trips.
    *   Solution: Honda issued a software update to address the issue by improving engine warm-up and combustion control. Some owners have also opted for more frequent oil changes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (covered under warranty if applicable), oil change ($50 - $100)
    *   Recalls: 2019-01 (Software update to correct the fuel/oil mixture issue)

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling) from the engine, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Juddering/Shaking at Low Speeds**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shaking or juddering sensation, especially when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with a CVT fluid change. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change ($150-$300), CVT replacement ($3000 - $5000+)

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic draw by a mechanic and repair or replacement of the faulty component. Could be related to the infotainment system, door locks, or other modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a restart.
    *   Solution: Honda released software updates to address some infotainment system issues. In some cases, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update (covered under warranty if applicable), Infotainment System Replacement ($500-$1500+)

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Honda CR-V is generally a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues, particularly with the 1.5L turbocharged engine (oil dilution) and the CVT (juddering). Electrical problems, such as battery drain and infotainment system malfunctions, are also common complaints. The severity of these issues varies, but some, like CVT replacement or turbocharger failure, can be costly. Addressing the oil dilution issue with software updates and frequent oil changes is crucial for 1.5T owners. While most issues are moderate in cost to repair, some engine and transmission repairs could be severe, depending on the failure. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inquire about the vehicle's maintenance history and any previous repairs.
