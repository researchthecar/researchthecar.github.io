The 2012 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It came standard with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 185 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. There were no other engine or transmission options for the 2012 model year in the United States. Owners often praise its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and good fuel economy. Some common complaints include the relatively simple interior design, the somewhat noisy engine at higher RPMs, and the lack of advanced technology features compared to newer vehicles.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Engine**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between changes. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000-3,000 miles. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be observed in severe cases.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and adding oil as needed can mitigate the issue. In some cases, a more extensive repair, such as replacing piston rings or valve seals, may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the extent of the repair).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **VTC Actuator Rattle on Cold Start**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start that lasts for a few seconds. This is often related to the Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator.
    * Solution: Replacing the VTC actuator with an updated part.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**
* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears.
    * Solution: Start with a transmission fluid change using Honda ATF DW-1 fluid. If the issue persists, further diagnosis may be needed, including checking the transmission sensors and solenoids.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $500+ (if sensor/solenoid replacement is needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension sagging, especially when carrying passengers or cargo. This can lead to a rougher ride and reduced handling performance.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and springs. Consider aftermarket options designed for heavier loads if the vehicle is frequently used for hauling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or unexpected battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods.
    * Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, and malfunctioning electronic modules. Replace the battery with an appropriate replacement battery as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the cause and complexity of the issue).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Driver's Side Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The driver's side door lock may intermittently fail to lock or unlock using the key fob or interior switch.
    * Solution: Replacing the driver's side door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Sun Visor Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sun visors may become loose and sag, obstructing the driver's view.
    * Solution: Replacing the sun visors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per visor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Honda CR-V, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. Engine-related problems, particularly excessive oil consumption and VTC actuator rattle, can be concerning. The transmission may experience harsh shifting. Other issues relate to the suspension, electrical system, and interior. The severity of these issues varies, with repair costs ranging from relatively minor (sun visor replacement) to potentially significant (engine work for oil consumption). It's important to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before buying a used 2012 CR-V.
