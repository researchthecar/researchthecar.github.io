The 2011 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It's powered by a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing 180 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Consumers appreciate the CR-V's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reputation for longevity. However, some common complaints include less-than-exciting styling, a somewhat noisy engine, and a basic interior compared to some competitors.
