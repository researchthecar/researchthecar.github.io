The 2016 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. Most models came equipped with a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 engine producing 185 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While generally well-regarded, some owners have reported specific issues. Owners generally appreciate the CR-V's practicality, comfortable ride, and fuel economy. Common dislikes include the sometimes sluggish acceleration and the CVT's characteristic drone under heavy acceleration.
