### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Honda CR-V demonstrates strong overall reliability, aligning with Honda's reputation. The most commonly cited issues are related to the 2.4L engine's tendency for oil consumption and potential VTEC solenoid leaks, along with occasional transmission hesitation in the automatic variant. Suspension components like sway bar links can wear over time, and some electrical issues such as power window motors and AC clutch failures have been reported. However, these are generally manageable and not indicative of systemic failure. For owners, regular maintenance, especially fluid checks and changes, is key to mitigating these potential problems and ensuring the longevity of the vehicle. The manual transmission variant is particularly robust.
