The 2007 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. The 2007 CR-V is only available with a 2.4L Inline-4 engine producing 166 hp and 161 lb-ft of torque, coupled with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and good fuel economy. Common dislikes include its somewhat uninspiring styling and a relatively noisy engine at higher speeds.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 (K24Z1)**

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start-up, lasting for a few seconds. This is caused by a faulty Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the VTC actuator with an updated version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gasket, timing chain cover, and rear main seal. Common symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle and the smell of burning oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-ups between oil changes.
    *   Solution: The root cause can vary, including worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the issue. Replacement of piston rings or valve stem seals can resolve the issue, but this is a major repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting between gears, particularly when cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with Honda ATF-DW1 can sometimes improve shifting performance. If the problem persists, valve body issues or worn clutch packs may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) to $1500 - $3000+ (transmission repair/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits noticeably lower than the front, especially when loaded with cargo or passengers. This can be caused by worn-out rear springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used for hauling cargo.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or clunking noises coming from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. This can be due to worn or damaged front strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replace the front strut mounts. It's often recommended to replace the struts at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (including struts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power door locks. Doors may not lock or unlock with the key fob or the door switches.
    *   Solution: This is often caused by a failing door lock actuator. Replace the faulty actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio Display Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio display may become dim, unreadable, or completely fail.
