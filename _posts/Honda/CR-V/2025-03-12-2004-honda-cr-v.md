The 2004 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. The primary engine option for this model year is the 2.4L inline-4 K24A1 gasoline engine, producing approximately 160 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. A key selling point of the 2004 CR-V is its spacious interior, ample cargo capacity, and smooth ride. However, some common complaints include relatively low power output, especially when fully loaded or driving uphill, and the potential for rust in certain climates. The 2004 CR-V came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2004 Honda CR-V, while a reliable vehicle, has some common issues to watch out for. Engine-related problems like excessive oil consumption and catalytic converter failure can be costly, though valve adjustments are relatively inexpensive. Transmission issues like harsh shifting require attention, with repair costs ranging from a simple fluid change to a complete rebuild. Suspension issues, particularly worn rear trailing arm bushings, are common. Electrical gremlins like power door lock and window regulator failures can also surface. Finally, rust and interior wear (sun visors) can affect the car's appearance and functionality. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, but being aware of them can help potential buyers make informed decisions.
