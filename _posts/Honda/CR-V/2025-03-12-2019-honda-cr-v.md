The 2019 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. Engine options for the 2019 CR-V include a 1.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 190 horsepower and 179 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L naturally aspirated inline-4 producing 184 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally praise the CR-V for its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and strong resale value. Common complaints include the sometimes-sluggish CVT performance and the infotainment system's dated interface.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Fuel Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel dilution in the oil is a known issue. The oil level rises, there is a strong smell of gasoline in the oil, and in severe cases, the engine may experience premature wear or even failure. This is more prevalent in colder climates and during short trips where the engine doesn't fully warm up.
    *   Solution: Honda released a software update to address this issue by modifying the fuel injection and engine management system. If the issue persists, oil changes must be performed at shorter intervals to mitigate the effects of fuel dilution. In extreme cases, replacement of the fuel injectors may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically covered under warranty. Oil changes vary but generally cost $50 - $150. Fuel injector replacement can cost $400 - $800.
    *   Recalls: 20-072

**2.4L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing jerky acceleration, hesitation, or a feeling of "rubber banding" during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can be more pronounced when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: A software update to the CVT control module may alleviate some of the issues. In some cases, a CVT fluid change can improve performance. Replacement of the CVT may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically covered under warranty. CVT fluid change can cost $100 - $300. CVT replacement can cost $3,000 - $5,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to the vehicle not starting, is reported by some owners. This may be due to a parasitic draw from electrical components or a faulty battery.
    *   Solution: Testing the battery and charging system, identifying any parasitic draws from aftermarket or factory electrical components. Replacing the battery with a high-quality replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the complexity of the parasitic draw and the cost of the new battery.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system freezes, crashes, or experiences lag. This includes issues with the touchscreen, navigation, and audio functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or software update may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update or reset is usually free. Infotainment unit replacement can cost $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Dim Headlights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with the headlights not being very bright and being difficult to see at night.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight bulbs with a brighter LED aftermarket bulb. Making sure the plastic headlight housing is clear and polished.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the bulb and where the repair is performed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various rattling noises from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area while driving, especially on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the rattle and securing the loose components. This may involve adding foam padding or tightening screws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the complexity of the repair and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Honda CR-V is generally a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of a few common issues. The most concerning is fuel dilution in the 1.5L turbocharged engine, which can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed. Other issues, such as CVT performance quirks and infotainment system glitches, are generally less severe but can still be frustrating. The cost of repairs can range from relatively inexpensive software updates or fluid changes to more significant expenses for CVT or infotainment system replacement. Overall, pre-purchase inspection, with an oil analysis in the case of the 1.5T, is recommended.
