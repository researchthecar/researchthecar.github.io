**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4 (L15BE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel mixing with the engine oil, leading to a gasoline smell in the oil, increased oil levels on the dipstick, and potential engine damage. More prevalent in colder climates and short trip driving.
    *   Solution: Honda has issued a software update to improve engine management and reduce oil dilution. In severe cases, oil changes may be necessary. Ensure the PCV system is functioning correctly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically free under warranty. Oil change ~$50-$100. PCV Valve replacement ~$50-150.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine, loss of power, and potential check engine light activation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
