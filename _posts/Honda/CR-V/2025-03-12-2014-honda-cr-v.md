**Summary**

The 2014 Honda CR-V is generally a reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues. The most concerning are related to the CVT transmission (juddering/failure) and the potential for excessive oil consumption with the 2.4L engine. Suspension sagging and electrical issues can also occur. The severity of these problems varies, and the cost of repair can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, particularly for transmission or engine work. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a trusted mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
