The 2000 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It's powered by a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 146 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. It was offered in both FWD and AWD. Owners generally appreciate its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and Honda's reputation for dependability. Common dislikes include its somewhat underwhelming power, especially when fully loaded, and some noted road noise at higher speeds.

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly occur from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and distributor O-ring. Visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected gasket or O-ring. Ensure proper torque during installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on location and whether DIY or professional)
