**Summary**

The 2001 Honda CR-V, while generally reliable, does suffer from some common issues related to its age. Engine oil leaks and distributor failures can occur, and the automatic transmission may experience harsh shifting. Suspension components like struts, shocks, and rear trailing arm bushings wear out over time. Electrically, power windows and the alternator can fail. Rust, particularly on the rear quarter panels, is a frequent issue. Interior problems can include a cracked dashboard. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but addressing these potential issues is crucial for maintaining the CR-V's reliability and longevity. While rust repair can be quite expensive, most other repairs are relatively affordable compared to newer vehicles.
