The 2003 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. The 2003 CR-V came standard with a 2.4-liter DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the CR-V for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and cargo capacity. Common complaints include lackluster acceleration, especially when fully loaded, and the dated 4-speed automatic transmission.
