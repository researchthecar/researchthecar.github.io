The 2009 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and fuel efficiency. It comes equipped with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine that produces 166 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and good gas mileage. Some common complaints include the relatively lackluster acceleration and the somewhat dated interior design for its time.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 (K24Z1)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This is more prevalent in higher mileage vehicles. Symptoms include low oil light illumination, unusual engine noise, and the need to add oil frequently.
    *   Solution: A compression test can help determine if the piston rings are worn. If the rings are the issue, the engine will need to be rebuilt or replaced. If the PCV valve is the problem, replacing the PCV valve can help to reduce oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5000+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle on Cold Start**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, typically on cold starts, that lasts for a few seconds. This is often caused by a faulty VTC (Variable Timing Control) actuator. The noise is due to oil draining out of the actuator when the engine is off, causing a temporary lack of lubrication upon startup.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VTC actuator with an updated version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. This can be due to worn transmission fluid or issues with the transmission solenoids.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush (using Honda ATF-DW1 fluid) is the first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, the solenoids may need to be inspected and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: With age and mileage, the rear suspension can start to sag, especially if the vehicle is frequently loaded with cargo or passengers. This can lead to a lower ride height in the rear, affecting handling and ride comfort.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and/or springs. Many owners opt for aftermarket springs designed to provide a slightly higher load capacity to combat this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Noisy Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn sway bar links, bushings, or ball joints.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery draining overnight or within a short period, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Disconnect aftermarket accessories one at a time to see if the drain stops. Replace the faulty module or battery as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Door Lock Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks not functioning correctly, either failing to lock/unlock or operating intermittently. This can be caused by a faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the rear wheel arches, especially in areas with harsh winters or where salt is used on the roads.
    *   Solution: Repairing the rust by sanding, patching, and repainting. Applying rust preventative measures to prevent future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per wheel arch, depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blowing warm air or not cooling effectively. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Recharge the refrigerant, repair the leak, replace the compressor, or replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sun Visor Sagging/Broken**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors drooping down or breaking at the hinge.
    *   Solution: Replace the sun visor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per visor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Honda CR-V is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as excessive oil consumption, VTC actuator rattle, harsh shifting, and suspension problems. Electrical and interior issues are also possible. While some of these issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like engine or transmission repairs, can be quite costly. Being aware of these potential problems can help buyers make an informed decision and budget for potential repairs.
