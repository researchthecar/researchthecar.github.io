**Introduction:**

The 2013 Honda CR-V is a compact SUV available with two engine and three transmission options. The base engine is a 2.4L 4-cylinder that produces 185 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. A 2.4L 4-cylinder with Earth Dreams fuel-saving technology is also available, producing 192 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L Earth Dreams engine comes standard with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The base 2.4L engine offers the option of a 5-speed automatic transmission or the CVT. Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard, and all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional.
