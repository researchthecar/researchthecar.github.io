The 2018 Honda CR-V is a popular compact SUV known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. Two engine options were available: a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated inline-4 engine producing 184 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 190 horsepower and 179 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the CR-V's comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and user-friendly technology. Common complaints include the sensitivity of the Honda Sensing system, some CVT performance characteristics, and concerns about engine oil dilution in the 1.5L turbo engine.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Engine Oil Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel mixing with engine oil, leading to a higher-than-normal oil level, fuel odor in the oil, and potential engine damage over time. Symptoms often appear in colder climates or during short trips where the engine doesn't fully warm up. This can potentially lead to premature engine wear.
    *   Solution: Honda released a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) to improve engine warm-up and combustion, which helps to reduce fuel dilution. In some cases, an oil change may also be recommended. In extreme cases, engine replacement might be necessary if damage has already occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $50-$100 (oil change), $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: 2018 CR-V's were affected by safety recall 21V-215 for the improper programming of the Fuel Injection amount, which can lead to fuel mixing with the oil.

*   **Turbo Lag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay in acceleration when pressing the accelerator pedal. This is due to the time it takes for the turbocharger to spool up and provide boost.
    *   Solution: While not a "fix" per se, understanding the nature of turbo lag can help manage expectations. Some owners have opted for aftermarket tuning solutions to try and minimize the lag, but this can void the warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Naturally Aspirated Inline-4**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Shuddering/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shuddering or jerking sensation, particularly during low-speed acceleration or when climbing hills. This can be caused by wear or issues within the CVT itself.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control unit (TCU) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a CVT fluid change or even a complete CVT replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $150-$300 (CVT fluid change), $3,000 - $5,000 (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Simulated Gear Shifts - Hesitation/Lag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT attempts to simulate traditional gear shifts, leading to a brief hesitation or lag during acceleration, especially during passing maneuvers.
    *   Solution: While technically not a "problem", but a characteristic of how Honda implemented the CVT programming. No real solution other than getting used to the car. Some owners have had luck with aftermarket tunes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking, popping, or creaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. This can sometimes be attributed to the rear struts.
    *   Solution: Inspect and potentially replace the rear struts or related suspension components such as bushings or stabilizer bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+ depending on parts replaced and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, particularly if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine or needing frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Identify any parasitic draws. Replacing the battery with a high-quality AGM battery can sometimes help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 (battery replacement), $100+ (diagnostics for parasitic draw).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Honda Sensing System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic behavior from the Honda Sensing system, including false alerts, failure to detect objects, or sudden braking.
    *   Solution: Ensure the radar sensor and camera are clean and unobstructed. Recalibration of the system may be necessary. In some cases, a faulty sensor may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (cleaning), $100-$300 (recalibration), $500+ (sensor replacement).
    *   Recalls: Some 2018 CR-V's were affected by safety recall 18V-109 for the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) software error that could prevent the CMBS from engaging.

**Exterior**

*   **Paint Quality**
    * Description/Symptoms: There are reports about the quality of the paint being thinner than that of other cars. This can lead to the paint being more prone to damage.
    * Solution: Prevention is the best solution, but also can have the vehicle professionally repainted.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slow response times, freezing, or glitches with the infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates may improve performance. In some cases, replacing the infotainment system may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $500+ (infotainment system replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Honda CR-V, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most concerning is the potential for engine oil dilution in the 1.5L turbo engine, which can lead to costly engine repairs if not addressed promptly. The CVT can also exhibit some shuddering or jerking, particularly in its early years. Electrical issues and the Honda Sensing system malfunctions can be annoying, but are usually less severe. Potential buyers should inquire about the history of the oil dilution issue (if the vehicle has the 1.5L turbo), and carefully test drive the vehicle to check for any transmission or suspension problems. Overall, the 2018 CR-V remains a good choice in the compact SUV segment, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their decision-making process.
