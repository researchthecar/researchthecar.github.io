The 2011 Honda Element is a unique and versatile compact SUV known for its boxy shape, spacious interior, and easy-to-clean surfaces. It was only offered with one engine and transmission option. The engine is a 2.4L i-VTEC inline-4 producing 166 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels (or optional Real Time 4WD) through a 5-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the Element for its practicality, durable interior, and pet-friendly design. Common complaints include its fuel economy, road noise, and polarizing styling. The last Element produced was the 2011 model year, and Honda stopped making the car due to decreasing sales.

**Engine**

**2.4L i-VTEC Inline-4**

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold start-up, typically lasting for a few seconds. This is due to a faulty Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator not holding oil pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VTC actuator with an updated part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an excessive amount of oil between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil levels, engine knocking noises, and blue exhaust smoke. This can be caused by worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test can help pinpoint the cause. Depending on the cause, the solution might involve replacing the piston rings, valve stem seals, or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates or shifts roughly between gears. This could be due to worn clutch packs, faulty solenoids, or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required, potentially leading to solenoid replacement or a transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (fluid flush), $200 - $600 (solenoid replacement), $2000 - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can lead to poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more of the power door locks stops working, either not locking or unlocking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Window Defroster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear window defroster stops working, or only works intermittently. This is often due to broken defroster grid lines or a faulty relay.
    *   Solution: Repair broken defroster grid lines with a repair kit, replace the defroster relay, or replace the entire rear window.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50 (grid repair kit), $20 - $50 (relay), $300-$800+ (window replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Cracking Plastic Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic body panels (especially the unpainted gray or black sections) can become brittle and crack over time, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked panels, often requiring finding used parts as new panels can be expensive or unavailable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, depending on the panel and whether new or used parts are used. $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging or Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sun visors droop down or break at the pivot point.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sun visor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Honda Element, while a practical vehicle, can suffer from several common issues as it ages. Engine issues such as VTC actuator rattle and oil consumption can be moderate to severe and potentially costly to repair. Suspension and electrical problems are also common, with moderate repair costs. The cracking plastic body panels are a cosmetic concern and can vary in cost depending on the availability of replacement parts. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any existing problems.
