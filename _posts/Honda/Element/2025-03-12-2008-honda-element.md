The 2008 Honda Element is a unique and versatile compact SUV known for its boxy design, spacious interior, and durable construction. Its utilitarian focus made it popular with outdoor enthusiasts and those needing a practical vehicle for hauling cargo. It came with a 2.4L DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine producing 166 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciated the Element's washable interior, flexible seating arrangements, and available Real Time 4WD system. Downsides often cited include relatively poor fuel economy for its size and dated styling.
