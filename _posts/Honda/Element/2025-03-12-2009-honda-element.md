The 2009 Honda Element is a unique and versatile compact SUV known for its boxy shape, spacious interior, and durable construction. The Element came with only one engine option: the 2.4L i-VTEC inline-4, producing 166 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Element for its practicality, easy-to-clean interior, and ample cargo space, making it ideal for outdoor enthusiasts and pet owners. Common criticisms include its polarizing design, wind noise at highway speeds, and relatively poor fuel economy compared to other compact SUVs.

**Engine**

**2.4L i-VTEC Inline-4**

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold startup, typically lasting for a few seconds. This is caused by a faulty Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator, which controls camshaft timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the VTC actuator with an updated part (often a revised design to prevent recurrence).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated. Diagnostic codes indicate a faulty oxygen sensor, leading to poor fuel economy, rough idling, and potential catalytic converter damage if left unresolved.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor (either upstream or downstream, depending on the diagnostic code).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, slipping, or harsh shifts between gears, especially when cold. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, solenoid issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Vehicle may feel unstable or wander. Visual inspection reveals cracked or torn trailing arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear trailing arm bushings. It is often recommended to replace both sides simultaneously.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when turning or driving over bumps. Worn strut mounts can also cause alignment issues and premature tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected strut mounts. It is recommended to replace struts at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more power door locks fail to function, requiring manual locking/unlocking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio Display Dimming/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio display dims excessively or fails completely. This can be caused by a faulty display unit or internal component failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the radio unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Honda Element generally exhibits good reliability, but certain issues are more prevalent. Engine issues, particularly the VTC actuator rattle, are common but often have relatively straightforward fixes. Transmission issues can range from minor (fluid flush) to major (rebuild/replacement). Suspension and electrical problems also occur, and some interior and exterior components are prone to wear or failure. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, especially if involving the transmission. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchase decision, including budgeting for potential repairs.
