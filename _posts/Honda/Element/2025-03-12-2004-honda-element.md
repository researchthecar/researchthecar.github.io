The 2004 Honda Element is a unique and versatile vehicle known for its boxy design, spacious interior, and durable construction. The 2004 Honda Element came standard with a 2.4L i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Element for its practicality, easy-to-clean interior, and cargo-carrying capabilities. Common dislikes include its polarizing styling, road noise, and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**2.4L i-VTEC 4-Cylinder**

*   **VTC Actuator Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon cold startup, typically lasting for a few seconds. This is due to the VTC (Variable Timing Control) actuator not properly locking into place.
    *   Solution: Replacing the VTC actuator with an updated version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Loose Fuel Cap**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light (CEL) illuminated due to an evaporative emissions system leak.
    *   Solution: Check and tighten or replace the fuel cap if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (tighten) - $20 (replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found
