The 2005 Honda Element is a unique and versatile vehicle loved for its spacious interior, easy-to-clean surfaces, and boxy, utilitarian design. It's powered by a 2.4L i-VTEC inline-4 engine producing 160 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. The Element is praised for its reliability, cargo capacity, and suitability for outdoor adventures. However, some owners find the gas mileage to be less than ideal and the styling isn't for everyone. Common dislikes include road noise and a somewhat firm ride.
