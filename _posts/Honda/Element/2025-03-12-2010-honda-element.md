The 2010 Honda Element is a versatile and boxy compact crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, durable construction, and unique design that appeals to those seeking practicality and utility. All 2010 Honda Elements came equipped with a 2.4-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine producing 166 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque. The engine could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Element's easy-to-clean interior, ample cargo space, and dog-friendly features. On the other hand, some criticize its fuel economy and polarizing styling.
