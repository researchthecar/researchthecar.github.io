The 2006 Honda Element is a unique and versatile vehicle loved for its spacious interior, easy-to-clean surfaces, and boxy, utilitarian design. It came standard with a 2.4L i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine producing 156 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission and a 4-speed automatic transmission were available. The Element's practicality and cargo capacity are major selling points, but some owners dislike its unconventional styling and potential for wind noise. Some owners have found the fuel economy lacking compared to other compact SUVs.
