The 2019 Honda Insight is a hybrid sedan that combines fuel efficiency with a comfortable ride. It is exclusively offered with a 1.5-liter Atkinson cycle inline-4 engine paired with Honda's two-motor hybrid system, producing a combined 151 horsepower and 197 lb-ft of torque. The Insight utilizes an e-CVT (electronic continuously variable transmission). Owners appreciate the Insight's fuel economy, spacious interior, and smooth ride. However, some common complaints include the infotainment system's complexity, road noise, and the limited trunk space due to the battery pack.
