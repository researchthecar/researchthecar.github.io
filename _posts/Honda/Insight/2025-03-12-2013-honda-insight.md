The 2013 Honda Insight is a hybrid electric vehicle offering fuel efficiency in a compact package. It is powered by a 1.3-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. This combination produces a combined 98 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. The Insight is only available with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its fuel economy and affordability, while common complaints include lackluster acceleration, road noise, and a somewhat dated interior compared to newer competitors.

**Summary**

The 2013 Honda Insight, while generally reliable, has a few common issues to be aware of. The most significant potential expenses are related to the IMA battery and CVT transmission, both of which can require costly repairs or replacements. The catalytic converter is another possible issue that can be very expensive. The other issues are minor but still should be inspected when shopping for a 2013 Honda Insight. Regular maintenance, particularly CVT fluid changes, is crucial for maximizing the lifespan of these components and avoiding major repairs.
