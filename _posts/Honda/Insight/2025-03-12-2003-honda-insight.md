The 2003 Honda Insight is a subcompact hybrid car known for its exceptional fuel economy and distinctive aerodynamic design. It came with a 1.0L 3-cylinder engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. The engine produced 67 horsepower and 66 lb-ft of torque, while the electric motor added 13 horsepower and 49 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or a CVT. Owners often praise the Insight for its fuel efficiency and unique styling, while some criticize its limited passenger and cargo space, as well as its relatively low power output.

**Electric Motor**

**1.0L 3-Cylinder Engine with Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)**

*   **IMA Battery Degradation/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The IMA battery pack gradually loses capacity over time, resulting in reduced electric assist, decreased fuel economy, and the IMA light illuminating on the dashboard. In severe cases, the car may lose its ability to provide electric assist completely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IMA battery pack with a new or refurbished unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Motor Assist Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electric motor fails to assist the engine, resulting in reduced power and efficiency. This can be caused by various issues, including a faulty motor, wiring problems, or a failure in the IMA control system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the root cause of the failure and repair or replacement of the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, and a high clutch pedal engagement point.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT Transmission**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
