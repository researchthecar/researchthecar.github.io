The 2002 Honda Insight is a groundbreaking hybrid vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy and distinctive aerodynamic design. Equipped with a 1.0L 3-cylinder IMA (Integrated Motor Assist) engine, it produced 67 horsepower and 66 lb-ft of torque, further assisted by a 13 hp electric motor. The Insight was offered with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). People generally appreciate the Insight for its fuel efficiency and unique styling, but some dislike its limited passenger and cargo space and relatively low power output. This list details the most frequent issues reported by 2002 Honda Insight owners.

**Electric Motor**

**IMA System**
* **IMA Battery Degradation/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The most common issue is degradation or failure of the Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) battery. This manifests as reduced electric assist, decreased fuel economy, the IMA light illuminating on the dashboard, and potentially reduced overall power. Battery failure can lead to the electric motor being disabled and the car operating solely on the gasoline engine.
    * Solution: Replacing the IMA battery is the primary solution. Reconditioning or balancing the existing battery cells may provide a temporary fix, but replacement is typically required for a long-term solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ depending on whether you choose a new or refurbished battery, and whether you do it yourself or go to a dealership/shop.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Failed MCM (Motor Control Module)**
    * Description/Symptoms: A failed MCM can cause the IMA system to not function properly. This causes no electric assist, decreased fuel economy, the IMA light illuminating on the dashboard, and potentially reduced overall power.
    * Solution: Replacing the MCM is the solution
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can occur in areas of the car, especially near the rear wheel arches.
    * Solution: Remove and repair the damaged area, or replace the whole body panel.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard LCD Screen Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The LCD screen in the dashboard that displays fuel economy and other hybrid system information can fail or become difficult to read due to pixel degradation.
    * Solution: Replacement of the LCD screen or the entire instrument cluster is the usual remedy.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ depending on DIY repair vs. professional replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Trailing Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear trailing arm bushings can wear out, leading to clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can also affect handling and stability.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn trailing arm bushings resolves the issue. Replacing the entire trailing arm assembly may be necessary if the bushings are severely damaged or difficult to remove.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+ depending on whether only the bushings are replaced or the entire arm.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Failed Combination Switch**
    * Description/Symptoms: The combination switch on the steering column (that controls headlights, turn signals, etc.) has been known to fail over time.
    * Solution: Replacement of the combination switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+ depending on DIY vs. professional replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Honda Insight, while innovative, is prone to certain issues, particularly relating to its hybrid system. The most significant concern is the IMA battery failure, which can be costly to address. Other issues like suspension wear and electrical problems are common in older vehicles but generally less expensive to resolve. Before purchasing, a thorough inspection, especially of the IMA system, is highly recommended.
