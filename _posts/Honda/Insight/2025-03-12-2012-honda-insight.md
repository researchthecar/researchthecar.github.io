The 2012 Honda Insight is a compact hybrid vehicle known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It features a 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system, producing a combined 98 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. It is only available with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its excellent gas mileage and relatively low cost of ownership, but some dislike its somewhat underpowered feel and basic interior.

**Engine**

**1.3L i-VTEC Inline-4 with Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the oil light illuminating, needing to add oil more frequently than expected, and potentially seeing blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. In severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary, but this is costly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the catalytic converter, often indicated by a check engine light (typically a P0420 code - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold) and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Hybrid System**

*   **IMA Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced battery capacity over time leading to decreased fuel economy, longer cranking times, and less assist from the electric motor. A warning light related to the IMA system might appear.
    *   Solution: Battery replacement or reconditioning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ for new battery; $800-$1500+ for reconditioning.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Motor Assist Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky acceleration or a lack of power when the electric motor should be assisting the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the motor assist system, which may involve replacing the motor assist module or other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the failed components.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shuddering or juddering sensation during acceleration, particularly at low speeds. This is often more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT fluid is the first step. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or even a full transmission replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for fluid change, $800-$1500+ for valve body, $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the transmission, typically with inability to shift, loud noises, and/or illuminated warning lights.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leakage/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy ride and reduced handling. Visible signs of leakage are also common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (for both shocks)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, used for starting and powering accessories, can experience premature drain. This may result in difficulty starting the car, especially after short periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system to identify the source of the drain. Replacement of the battery may be required. Also, look for aftermarket accessories wired incorrectly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement, $100 - $500+ for diagnosing and repairing parasitic drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door lock actuators, resulting in doors that cannot be locked or unlocked with the remote or interior switch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, leading to reduced visibility and potential damage to the bulbs or wiring.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlight and resealing it, or replacing the headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for resealing, $300 - $800+ for replacement (per headlight)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, or use of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for a dash cover, $800+ for a replacement dashboard.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Honda Insight, while fuel-efficient and affordable, has some common issues to be aware of. The CVT transmission is a known weak point, potentially leading to costly repairs or replacement. The IMA battery degradation and excessive oil consumption can also be significant expenses. Suspension and electrical issues are less severe but should be considered. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major, expensive repairs.
