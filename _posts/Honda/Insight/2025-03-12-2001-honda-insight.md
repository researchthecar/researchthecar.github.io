The 2001 Honda Insight is a groundbreaking hybrid vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy and unique aerodynamic design. Powered by a 1.0L three-cylinder gasoline engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system, it produces a combined 73 horsepower and 91 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a CVT. Owners often appreciate the Insight's fuel efficiency and distinctive styling, but some dislike its limited passenger and cargo space, as well as the quirky hybrid system that can present unique maintenance challenges.

**Electric Motor**

**Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)**
*   **IMA Battery Degradation/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced assist from the electric motor, decreased fuel economy, warning lights (IMA, check engine), potential for complete battery failure and inability to start the car. Early models were particularly susceptible to battery degradation.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reconditioning of the IMA battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Motor Control Module (MCM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete loss of IMA assist, IMA light illumination, stalling, or inability to start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Motor Control Module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, high engagement point.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, slipping, jerky movements, CVT warning light illumination, complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid change, or CVT replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Trailing Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the rear suspension, poor handling, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear trailing arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the vehicle, especially in cold weather, dimming lights. The 12V battery in the Insight is smaller than typical car batteries, making it more susceptible to drain and failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery with a high-quality, compatible battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Gauge Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the digital gauge cluster.
    *   Solution: Gauge cluster repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Aluminum Body Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Although the Insight has an aluminum body to reduce weight, some models in certain climates experienced corrosion, particularly around seams and edges.
    *   Solution: Repairing the corroded areas, potentially requiring bodywork and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, depending on the severity and extent of the corrosion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Mounts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the seat mounts to the floor.
    *   Solution: Welding the cracked pieces back together, or replace the seat mounts if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Honda Insight, while innovative, is prone to specific issues related to its hybrid powertrain. The IMA battery is the most significant concern, both in terms of cost and frequency. Other potential problems include CVT failures and suspension wear. The severity of the issues ranges from minor electrical problems to expensive battery replacements, making pre-purchase inspections essential. While most of the issues are moderate in severity, the cost to fix them can vary widely from a couple hundred dollars to multiple thousands of dollars.
