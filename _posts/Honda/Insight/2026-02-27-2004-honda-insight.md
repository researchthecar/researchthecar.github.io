### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Honda Insight is a remarkably reliable vehicle, particularly for its age and hybrid technology. The primary concerns revolve around the longevity of the hybrid battery pack and, to a lesser extent, the IMA control module and CVT transmission. These components are expensive to replace but are not universally problematic. Routine maintenance, especially for the CVT fluid, is crucial. Beyond these hybrid-specific elements, the Insight exhibits typical automotive reliability, with few widespread issues reported in its engine, suspension, electrical (excluding the 12V battery), exterior, or interior components.
