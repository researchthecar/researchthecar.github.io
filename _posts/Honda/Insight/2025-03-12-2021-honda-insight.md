The 2021 Honda Insight is a hybrid sedan that offers a blend of fuel efficiency, practicality, and a refined driving experience. It comes exclusively with a 1.5-liter Atkinson-cycle inline-4 engine paired with a two-motor hybrid system, producing a combined 151 horsepower and 197 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (e-CVT). Owners often praise the Insight for its exceptional fuel economy and comfortable ride.
