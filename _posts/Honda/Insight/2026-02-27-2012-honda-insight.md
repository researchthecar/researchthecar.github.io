### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Honda Insight generally offers good reliability, particularly in its core powertrain components when maintained properly. The most significant potential issues revolve around the hybrid system, specifically the degradation of the hybrid battery pack and occasional failures of the inverter/converter. Transmission issues, while not extremely common, can manifest as shuddering or hesitation. Owners should be aware of the potential for premature 12V battery failure and monitor for oil consumption in the gasoline engine. Beyond these specific hybrid-related concerns, the Insight's suspension, exterior, and interior components tend to be robust, with no widespread critical failures reported.
