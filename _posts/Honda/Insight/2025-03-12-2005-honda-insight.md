The 2005 Honda Insight is a unique subcompact hybrid car known for its exceptional fuel economy and lightweight design. It was offered with a 1.0L 3-cylinder engine producing 67 horsepower and 66 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praised its fuel efficiency, distinctive styling, and nimble handling. However, common complaints include its limited passenger and cargo space, relatively low power output, and potential issues related to its Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system.

**Electric Motor**

**1.0L 3-Cylinder IMA System**

* **IMA Battery Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced assist from the electric motor, decreased fuel economy, the "check engine" light illuminating with IMA-related codes, and potential inability to start the car.
    * Solution: Replacement or reconditioning of the IMA battery pack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Motor Assist Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Jerky or inconsistent power delivery from the electric motor, particularly during acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: Software update for the IMA system, replacement of faulty sensors (e.g., battery voltage sensor), or replacement of the motor control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**CVT Transmission**

* **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining or grinding noises from the transmission, slipping during acceleration, hesitation or jerking during gear changes (simulated in the CVT), and complete transmission failure in severe cases.
    * Solution: Replacement or complete rebuild of the CVT transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Trailing Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps. The car may feel unstable in the rear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear trailing arm bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **12V Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery frequently drains, especially if the car is not driven regularly. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or requiring frequent jump starts.
    * Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery with a high-quality AGM battery, checking for parasitic draws, and ensuring the IMA system is properly charging the battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Headlight Dimming**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, particularly at idle or low speeds, which can be related to the IMA system's charging behavior or voltage regulator issues.
    * Solution: Check the IMA system, voltage regulator, and alternator. Repair or replace as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rear Hatch Struts**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch slowly descends or fails to stay open on its own.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear hatch struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or use of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2005 Honda Insight, while praised for its fuel efficiency, has a few common issues. The most concerning is the potential failure of the IMA battery pack and CVT transmission which are both expensive to repair. Other issues, like suspension bushings and 12V battery issues, are more manageable. Potential buyers should be aware of these possible repairs when considering a 2005 Honda Insight.
