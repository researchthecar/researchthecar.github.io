The 2020 Honda Insight is a hybrid sedan that offers excellent fuel economy and a comfortable ride. It is powered by a 1.5-liter Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 151 horsepower and 197 lb-ft of torque. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is the only transmission option. People like the Insight for its fuel efficiency, refined interior, and smooth hybrid system.
