The 2010 Honda Insight is a hybrid hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was offered with a 1.3-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. This combination produced a combined 98 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque. A Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) was the only transmission option. Some owners appreciate the Insight's excellent gas mileage and eco-friendly design. Common complaints include lackluster performance, a somewhat stiff ride, and limited rear passenger space.
