The 2004 Honda Insight is a subcompact hybrid vehicle known for its exceptional fuel economy. It was offered with a 1.0L inline-three cylinder engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. The engine produces 67 horsepower and 66 lb-ft of torque, while the electric motor adds 13 horsepower and 46 lb-ft of torque. It came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the Insight for its high MPG and unique styling, but common complaints include its lack of power, limited cargo space, and aging hybrid system components.

**Electric Motor**

**IMA Hybrid System**

*   **IMA Battery Degradation/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) battery pack degrades over time, leading to reduced electric assist, decreased fuel economy, and potential error codes on the dashboard. Eventually, the battery may completely fail, preventing the electric motor from assisting the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reconditioning of the IMA battery pack. Some owners opt for aftermarket battery replacements, while others attempt to recondition the existing pack by replacing individual cells.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DC-DC Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DC-DC converter charges the 12V battery from the high-voltage IMA battery. Failure results in a dead 12V battery, preventing the car from starting.
    *   Solution: Replace the DC-DC converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT can be prone to failure, especially at higher mileages. Symptoms include shuddering, slipping, erratic shifting, a whine or unusual noise, and failure to accelerate properly. Error codes may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the CVT.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Start Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The start clutch, which engages when the car is started or shifted into drive, can fail. This causes delayed or jerky engagement, especially when starting from a stop or when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT start clutch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Wheel Bearings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear wheel bearings are known to fail, especially at high mileage. The symptoms include a humming, roaring, or grinding noise from the rear of the vehicle, which increases with speed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected rear wheel bearing(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While the hybrid system handles much of the electrical load, the 12V battery is still crucial for starting the car and running accessories. The 12V battery can fail prematurely, leading to difficulty starting or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the 12V battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Light Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bulbs within the instrument cluster can burn out, making it difficult to read gauges and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the burnt-out bulbs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the undercarriage and body panels, especially in areas with road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Odometer LCD Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD screen that displays the odometer reading can fail, making it difficult or impossible to see the mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the instrument cluster or repair of the LCD screen (if possible).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Honda Insight, while offering excellent fuel economy, suffers from age-related issues, primarily concerning its hybrid system. The most significant and costly problems revolve around the IMA battery and the CVT transmission. Additionally, owners may encounter issues with the suspension, electrical components, and rust. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, the major repairs can be costly and may deter potential buyers.
