The 2011 Honda Insight is a hybrid subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency. It comes equipped with a 1.3-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine paired with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. This engine produces 98 horsepower and 123 lb-ft of torque combined. The Insight is only available with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the Insight's excellent fuel economy and affordability. However, some common complaints include a somewhat noisy engine, limited rear passenger space, and a less engaging driving experience compared to some other hybrids.
