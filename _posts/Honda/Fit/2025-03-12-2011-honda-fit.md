The 2011 Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, versatility, and spacious interior relative to its small size. It features a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 117 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Fit's practicality, reliability, and nimble handling. However, some common complaints include road noise, a somewhat stiff ride, and less-than-stellar acceleration compared to larger vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2011 Honda Fit is generally a reliable vehicle, but certain issues can arise. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption and VTC actuator noise can be costly to address. Transmission issues, while less common, can also be expensive. Other potential problems, such as suspension sag and electrical malfunctions, are typically less severe in terms of cost.
