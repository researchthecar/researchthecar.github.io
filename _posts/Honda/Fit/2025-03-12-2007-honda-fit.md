The 2007 Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior (thanks to Honda's "Magic Seat" system), and nimble handling. It came equipped with a 1.5-liter i-VTEC inline-4 engine producing 109 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its practicality, reliability, and fuel economy, but some common complaints include a harsh ride, road noise, and less-than-stellar acceleration.
