The 2017 Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback known for its impressive fuel economy, spacious interior (thanks to the "Magic Seat" system), and nimble handling. The 2017 model is part of the third generation (GK) Fit, which received a mid-cycle refresh for the 2018 model year. All 2017 Honda Fits are equipped with a 1.5-liter direct-injected DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual transmission (MT) (available only on LX and EX trims) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Fit's practicality, versatility, and reliability. Common complaints often revolve around the car's somewhat noisy ride, firm suspension, and the CVT's behavior, which some find less engaging than a traditional automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**1.5L DOHC i-VTEC 4-Cylinder**

* **Direct Injection Carbon Buildup**
    * Description/Symptoms: The direct injection system can cause carbon to build up on the intake valves over time, leading to rough idling, misfires, reduced fuel economy, and decreased performance.
    * Solution: A professional intake valve cleaning service, often involving walnut blasting, is typically required to remove the carbon buildup.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

* **Juddering/Shaking During Acceleration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported juddering or shaking, particularly during light acceleration from a stop or at low speeds. This is often described as feeling like the car is hesitating or vibrating.
    * Solution: A software update to the CVT control module may help. In some cases, a CVT fluid change or even CVT replacement has been necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change), $100 - $300 (software update), $3000 - $5000 (CVT replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hesitation/Lack of Power**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some drivers have noted a delay or hesitation when accelerating, especially when trying to pass or merge onto the highway. This can make the car feel underpowered, particularly with a full load of passengers or cargo.
    * Solution: First check and clean the air filter. Check for any engine codes that may be present. In extreme cases, the CVT may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 (air filter replacement), $100 - $200 (diagnosis), $3000 - $5000 (CVT replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This may be caused by worn or loose suspension components.
    * Solution: Inspection of the rear suspension components, including shocks, struts, bushings, and sway bar links, is recommended. Replacement of worn or damaged parts may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the parts needing replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure is a common complaint. Symptoms include difficulty starting the engine, especially in cold weather, and the need for frequent jump-starts.
    * Solution: Replacement of the battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Display Screen Issues (Infotainment)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the infotainment system's display screen, including freezing, black screens, or unresponsiveness to touch inputs.
    * Solution: Restarting the infotainment system may temporarily resolve the issue. A software update may be available to address the problem. In some cases, the entire unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (restart), $0-$200 (software update), $500 - $1500 (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Rattling/Buzzing Sounds**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many owners report various rattling or buzzing sounds emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces. These noises can be particularly noticeable on rough roads.
    * Solution: Locating and isolating the source of the rattles or buzzes and then applying felt tape, foam padding, or other sound-dampening materials to secure loose parts or dampen vibrations.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly, can be a DIY fix, or $100 - $300+ at a shop.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Magic Seat Latch Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty latching the Magic Seats into their upright or folded-down positions, or latches failing completely.
    * Solution: Inspecting the latch mechanism for obstructions, lubrication, or damage. Replacement of the latch may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Honda Fit is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with the CVT, particularly juddering or hesitation during acceleration. Carbon buildup on the intake valves is another concern. Other potential problems include suspension noise, electrical issues (battery and display screen), and interior rattling. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help maintain the vehicle's performance and longevity. The most expensive potential repair is the CVT replacement.
