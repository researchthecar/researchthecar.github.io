The 2018 Honda Fit is a subcompact car known for its exceptional fuel economy, versatile interior space (thanks to the "Magic Seat" system), and nimble handling. It comes equipped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 128 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People generally like the Fit for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and surprising cargo capacity for its size. Common dislikes include a sometimes noisy ride, and the CVT transmission's droning sound during acceleration.
