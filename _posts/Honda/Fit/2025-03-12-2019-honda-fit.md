The 2019 Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback known for its exceptional fuel economy, spacious interior (thanks to the "Magic Seat" system), and nimble handling. It is powered by a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 128 horsepower and 113 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual (on the base trim) and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). People generally like the Fit for its practicality, reliability, and affordability. Common dislikes include the somewhat noisy engine and the firm ride. The following are common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2019 Honda Fit.

**Engine**

**1.5L Four-Cylinder**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes. This may manifest as the low oil level light illuminating, or a noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick.
    * Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some owners have had success with switching to a different oil viscosity or brand. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely. Switching oil is inexpensive. Piston ring replacement can range from $1,500 - $3,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
* **Juddering/Shaking During Acceleration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a noticeable juddering or shaking sensation, particularly during light acceleration at low speeds (around 20-40 mph). This may feel like the transmission is "hunting" for the correct gear ratio.
    * Solution: A CVT fluid change with genuine Honda HCF-2 fluid may resolve the issue. In some cases, a software update for the CVT control module may be necessary. In more severe cases, CVT replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change: $100 - $200. Software update: $50 - $150. CVT replacement: $3,000 - $5,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can occur, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days. This can manifest as a slow crank or a complete inability to start the engine.
    * Solution: Thoroughly check for parasitic draws (anything drawing power while the car is off). Common culprits include aftermarket accessories installed incorrectly, faulty door switches causing interior lights to stay on, or a failing alternator diode. Battery replacement with an AGM battery is sometimes required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Parasitic draw diagnosis: $100 - $200+. Battery replacement: $150 - $300+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions if integrated into the system.
    * Solution: Check for software updates for the infotainment system and install the latest version. Performing a hard reset of the system may temporarily resolve the issue. If the problem persists, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: Usually free (dealer visit may incur a labor charge). Infotainment unit replacement: $500 - $1,500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling noises emanating from the dashboard area, particularly on rough roads. This can be caused by loose trim pieces or components within the dashboard assembly.
    * Solution: Locate the source of the rattle and secure any loose trim pieces. Adding foam padding or felt tape behind trim panels can help dampen vibrations.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on severity and complexity. Minor fixes may be DIY. Professional repair: $100 - $300+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shock Absorber Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted a clunking or squeaking noise emanating from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This may indicate worn or damaged rear shock absorbers.
    * Solution: Inspect the rear shock absorbers for leaks or damage. Replace the shock absorbers in pairs if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Rear shock absorber replacement (pair): $300 - $600+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Honda Fit generally enjoys a good reputation for reliability, but like any vehicle, it is not without its potential issues. The most commonly reported problems involve the CVT transmission (juddering/shaking), electrical gremlins (battery drain, infotainment issues), and interior rattles. Engine issues such as excessive oil consumption can be costly to repair but are not widespread. Severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect the vehicle, including test driving it under various conditions, before making a purchase.
