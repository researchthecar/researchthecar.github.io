**Honda Fit 2019**

The 2019 Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback with sharp handling, compact size, and fuel efficiency. Power comes from a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine with 130 horsepower and 114 pound-feet of torque, mated to either a six-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Fit is popular due to its versatility, value, and high-reliability ratings. However, some owners have encountered various issues with their vehicles.
