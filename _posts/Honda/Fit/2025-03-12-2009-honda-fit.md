The 2009 Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, surprising cargo capacity (thanks to its "Magic Seat" system), and nimble handling. It came with a single engine option, a 1.5-liter i-VTEC inline-4 producing 117 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its practicality, reliability, and fun-to-drive nature. However, some common complaints include a somewhat stiff ride, road noise, and relatively basic interior features compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**1.5L i-VTEC Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust pipe can also indicate oil burning.
    *   Solution: Checking oil levels frequently and using the correct viscosity oil (0W-20) as specified by Honda is recommended. In severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ for piston ring replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating are common symptoms. Diagnosis often reveals a faulty ignition coil.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil. It's often recommended to replace all coils at the same time to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on whether individual coil or all)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Hesitation or Jerking During Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation or jerky shifts, particularly when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid drain and fill with Honda ATF-Z1 fluid is often the first step. In some cases, a more thorough flush may be required. If the problem persists, valve body issues could be the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for fluid change; $500-$1500+ for valve body repair/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing over bumps, and clunking noises from the rear of the vehicle. Visible oil leaks on the shock absorbers are a sign of failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ for both shocks and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may stop working or become slow and erratic in their operation. A grinding noise from the window motor is also a sign of failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Tail Light Bulb Socket Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tail lights may flicker, become dim, or stop working entirely. Corrosion is often visible on the bulb sockets.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the corrosion from the bulb sockets or replacing the sockets entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the extent of the damage and if a full wiring harness repair is needed
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard material, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacement of the entire dashboard, which can be very costly, or use a dashboard cover to prevent further damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system blows warm air instead of cold, or makes unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air conditioning compressor and potentially other components of the AC system, such as the receiver drier and expansion valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Honda Fit is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any car, it has its share of potential issues. The most concerning problems include excessive oil consumption and potential issues with the automatic transmission, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical problems related to the tail lights and power windows are also fairly common. Dashboard cracking, although not a mechanical issue, can affect the car's appearance and resale value. While some of these issues can be expensive to fix, the overall reliability of the Fit makes it a decent option for a fuel-efficient and practical vehicle, provided potential buyers are aware of these common issues and have the vehicle inspected before purchasing.
