The 2015 Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback known for its exceptional fuel economy, spacious interior, and versatile "Magic Seat" configuration. It comes with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 130 horsepower and 114 lb-ft of torque. This engine is available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Fit's practicality, nimble handling, and reliability. However, some common complaints include the road noise, basic interior features, and, for some, the performance of the CVT.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Engine Oil Dilution**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel smell in the oil, rising oil level on the dipstick, and potential engine damage due to reduced lubrication.

**Summary**

The 2015 Honda Fit, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission, which can exhibit shuddering or even fail prematurely. Engine-related issues, such as carbon buildup and oil dilution, can also occur. Suspension noises and electrical problems are less severe but can still be annoying. The cost to address these issues varies, with CVT repairs potentially being the most expensive. Buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic to assess the condition of the transmission and engine.
