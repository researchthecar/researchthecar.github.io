The 2008 Honda Fit is a subcompact car known for its exceptional fuel economy, surprising cargo space thanks to its "Magic Seat" system, and nimble handling. Its single engine option is a 1.5L i-VTEC inline-4, producing 109 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Fit for its reliability, versatility, and fuel efficiency. However, common complaints include a somewhat noisy cabin, a firm ride, and the engine's lack of power when fully loaded or climbing hills.
