The 2010 Honda Fit is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and nimble handling. Powered by a 1.5-liter inline-4 engine producing 117 horsepower and 106 lb-ft of torque, it was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its practicality, reliability, and fun-to-drive nature. However, some common complaints include a somewhat noisy cabin, a firm ride, and limited features compared to some competitors.
