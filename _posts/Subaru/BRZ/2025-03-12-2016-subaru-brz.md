The 2016 Subaru BRZ is a rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its handling and affordability. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed (flat/boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the BRZ's precise steering, balanced chassis, and engaging driving experience. Criticisms generally focus on the engine's modest power output and the car's relatively basic interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Horizontally Opposed 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, sometimes requiring a quart every 1,000 miles or less. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and fouled spark plugs. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be observed.
    *   Solution: The issue is often attributed to piston ring design. Subaru issued a service bulletin and has, in some cases, replaced the engine short block with an updated design. In some cases, the affected parts could be replaced without replacing the whole short block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A potential valve spring failure can cause the engine to run roughly, misfire, or stall. It could trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty valve springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Synchro Wear/Grinding Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly 2nd and 3rd, especially when the transmission is cold. This is often attributed to premature synchro wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected synchros or rebuilding the transmission. In some cases, using a different transmission fluid may alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains while the vehicle is not in use, especially after a few days. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Identify the parasitic draw by testing each fuse in the car to see which one has the parasitic draw. Once you know what module is drawing power when the car is off, you need to replace that module. In some cases, it is not a faulty module but rather improperly installed aftermarket electronics.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Freezing or Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory-installed navigation or infotainment system can freeze, lag, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Updating the software or replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Subaru BRZ, while praised for its handling, can suffer from issues such as excessive oil consumption, transmission problems, and electrical quirks. The most serious and expensive problems relate to potential engine rebuild or replacement, and addressing synchro issues in the manual transmission. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and carefully inspect the car before purchase.
