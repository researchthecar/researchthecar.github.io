The 2017 Subaru BRZ is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe known for its sharp handling and engaging driving experience. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder (boxer) engine producing 205 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque when paired with the six-speed manual transmission (200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque with the six-speed automatic). Owners typically praise the BRZ for its affordability, responsive steering, and balanced chassis, making it a fun car on twisty roads and ideal for tuning. Common complaints revolve around the lack of low-end torque, engine noise, and somewhat basic interior features.

**Engine**

**2.0L FA20 Engine (Manual Transmission)**

* **Engine Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the timing cover, valve cover gaskets, or oil pan. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets and resealing the leaking areas.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Spring Recall**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some 2013-2017 BRZ models were subject to a recall due to faulty valve springs that could fracture, leading to engine stalling or failure.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve springs with updated parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Covered by recall)
    * Recalls: 18V733000
    * Notes: This recall impacted specific production dates and VIN ranges. Verify if your specific vehicle was affected.

**2.0L FA20 Engine (Automatic Transmission)**

* **Engine Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the manual transmission version, oil leaks can occur from the timing cover, valve cover gaskets, or oil pan. Visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels are common symptoms.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets and resealing the leaking areas.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Spring Recall**
    * Description/Symptoms: Identical to the manual transmission models, certain 2013-2017 BRZ models equipped with the automatic transmission were subject to a recall due to faulty valve springs.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve springs with updated parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Covered by recall)
    * Recalls: 18V733000
    * Notes: This recall impacted specific production dates and VIN ranges. Verify if your specific vehicle was affected.

**Transmission**

**Aisin TL-70 6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Synchro Wear/Grinding Gears**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into certain gears, especially 2nd and 3rd, accompanied by a grinding noise. This indicates worn synchros.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected synchros or rebuilding the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether it's a rebuild or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Aisin AWR6B45 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifting between gears, especially noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and software update can improve shifting. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for an extended period. This can be caused by parasitic draw from electrical components.
    * Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing individual circuits and components. A new battery may also be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Tail Light Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Condensation or moisture buildup inside the tail light housings.
    * Solution: Removing the tail lights, drying them out, and resealing the housings. Some owners drill small drain holes, although this can void any remaining warranty.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Poor Air Conditioning Performance**
    * Description/Symptoms: Weak or inconsistent airflow from the air conditioning system, especially in hot weather.
    * Solution: Checking the refrigerant levels, inspecting the compressor and condenser, and potentially replacing faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Subaru BRZ, while a fun and engaging sports car, does have some common issues. The most significant and potentially costly problems relate to engine oil leaks and valve spring failures (covered by recall, if applicable). Transmission issues, particularly synchro wear in the manual and harsh shifting in the automatic, can also be expensive to repair. Electrical issues like battery drain are less severe but can be frustrating. Owners should be aware of these potential problems when considering a used 2017 BRZ and perform a thorough inspection before purchase.
