The 2023 Subaru BRZ is a popular rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its sharp handling, engaging driving experience, and relatively affordable price point. It comes standard with a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated horizontally-opposed (Boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 228 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. While praised for its fun factor and updated engine compared to the first generation, some owners have reported certain issues. Common complaints include road noise, a somewhat spartan interior, and limited practicality due to the small rear seats and trunk.

**Summary**

The 2023 Subaru BRZ is generally considered a reliable sports car, but like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The most concerning reports are related to the engine and transmission, specifically excessive oil consumption in the engine and harsh shifting in the automatic transmission. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery are also worth noting. Exterior paint can also be prone to damage. Many of the reported issues are minor and can be addressed relatively easily, but engine and transmission repairs can be costly.
