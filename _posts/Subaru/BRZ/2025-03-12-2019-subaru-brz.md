The 2019 Subaru BRZ is a rear-wheel-drive sports coupe known for its sharp handling and engaging driving experience. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated horizontally-opposed four-cylinder engine, producing 205 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque when paired with the 6-speed manual transmission or 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque with the 6-speed automatic. The BRZ is praised for its affordability, lightweight design, and communicative steering. However, some owners find its engine lacking in low-end torque and its interior somewhat basic.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Horizontally-Opposed Four-Cylinder (FA20)**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The amount of oil consumed varies.
    * Solution: Subaru issued a service bulletin about this issue, but there is no solution. Some have tried heavier weight oil or changing oil brands, but this is not a fix. Replacing the piston rings may reduce oil consumption in some cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Recall (Earlier FA20 Engines, but some 2019s impacted)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Potential for valve spring fracture, leading to engine stall or failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve springs.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**
* **Occasional Grinding or Difficulty Shifting into Certain Gears**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a grinding noise or difficulty engaging specific gears, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can sometimes be resolved by double-clutching or allowing the transmission to warm up.
    * Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid with a higher-quality synthetic fluid can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ depending on severity.

    * Solution: Tightening loose trim pieces, applying sound-deadening material, or replacing worn-out clips and fasteners.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the severity and location of the noise.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Subaru BRZ is a generally reliable sports car, but owners should be aware of a few potential issues.
