The 2013 Subaru BRZ is a lightweight, rear-wheel-drive sports coupe that shares its platform and many components with the Scion FR-S (later Toyota 86). It is powered by a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated horizontally-opposed (Boxer) four-cylinder engine, producing 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the BRZ for its engaging handling, responsive steering, and affordability, making it a popular choice for enthusiasts. Common complaints include the engine's lack of low-end torque, the relatively small size of the cabin and trunk, and road noise.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Boxer Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible exhaust smoke (especially under acceleration), and the need to add oil every few hundred miles. This issue is more prevalent in later model years as well.
    *   Solution: Initially, Subaru issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) to address this issue. It involved performing an oil consumption test. If the consumption exceeded a certain threshold, the engine would be replaced or rebuilt under warranty. Later fixes have involved replacing piston rings with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ (depending on repair severity and if the engine needs to be replaced).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Recall (Later Years)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While the 2013 model year wasn't directly affected by the valve spring recall that hit later years (2013-2014 FR-S, 2013 BRZ) due to a manufacturing defect, it's worth noting as a potential concern as cars age and parts are sometimes swapped. The faulty valve springs could fracture, leading to engine failure. Symptoms included rough running, misfires, and eventually complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Affected vehicles received new valve springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This repair should be covered under the original recall if valve springs from those years are present.
    *   Recalls: Refer to NHTSA recall campaigns related to valve springs for the BRZ and FR-S for affected VINs and remedy procedures.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Reverse Gear Grinding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging reverse gear, often accompanied by a grinding noise. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Some owners have found that fully depressing the clutch and waiting a few seconds before engaging reverse helps. In some cases, the issue is due to worn synchronizers and may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether a rebuild or replacement is necessary).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, the problem may be due to low transmission fluid or worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and required repairs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Exterior**

*   **Tail Light Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture or condensation accumulating inside the tail light housings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the tail light assembly or sealing the existing unit to prevent moisture intrusion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per tail light (depending on whether a new assembly is purchased or the existing one is sealed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Buzzing Noise from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A buzzing or rattling noise emanating from the dashboard, often around the center console or instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: This is often a difficult noise to pinpoint. Some owners have traced it to loose trim pieces, wiring harnesses, or other components within the dashboard. Applying foam padding or securing the loose parts can sometimes resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the complexity of the repair and whether professional help is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Subaru BRZ, while lauded for its driving dynamics, has some common issues. The most significant is potential excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to repair if not addressed promptly. Reverse gear grinding in the manual transmission is another frequently reported issue, though often manageable with driving technique. Other problems, like tail light condensation and dash buzzing, are more minor annoyances. Overall, the BRZ is generally reliable but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems, especially the oil consumption issue.
