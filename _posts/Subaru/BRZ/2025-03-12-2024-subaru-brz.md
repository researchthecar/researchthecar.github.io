The 2024 Subaru BRZ is a popular rear-wheel-drive sports coupe known for its engaging driving dynamics, lightweight design, and affordability. It comes standard with a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated horizontally opposed (Boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 228 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners typically praise the BRZ for its sharp handling, communicative steering, and overall fun-to-drive character.
