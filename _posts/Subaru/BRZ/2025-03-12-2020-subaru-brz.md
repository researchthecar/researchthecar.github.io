**Engine**

**2.0L Boxer Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may manifest as the low oil light illuminating frequently or noticing a burning smell.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. For severe cases, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test. If consumption is excessive, possible repairs include piston ring replacement or even engine replacement, depending on the severity.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+ (depending on the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported fuel injector failure. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and potential stalling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). Diagnosis may involve checking fuel trims, injector pulse width, and performing a fuel injector balance test.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported difficulty shifting into first or second gear, particularly when the transmission is cold. Grinding noises may also be present.
    * Solution: Possible solutions include changing the transmission fluid with a higher-quality synthetic fluid, adjusting the clutch cable, or replacing worn synchros. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable at lower speeds.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush may help in some cases. However, more serious issues may require valve body replacement or transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the battery draining quickly, particularly if the car is left unused for several days. This may be due to a parasitic draw.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair the parasitic draw by systematically testing circuits to identify the source of the drain. This might involve replacing a faulty module or fixing a wiring issue.

**Summary**

The 2020 Subaru BRZ has a few common issues. Engine-related problems like excessive oil consumption and fuel injector failure can lead to moderate to high repair costs. Transmission issues, especially with the manual gearbox, can also be costly if a rebuild is required. Electrical problems, such as battery drain, are generally less severe but require diagnosis. The 2020 BRZ is generally reliable, but prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
