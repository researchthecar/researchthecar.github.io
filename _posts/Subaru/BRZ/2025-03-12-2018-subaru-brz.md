The 2018 Subaru BRZ is a rear-wheel-drive sports car known for its sharp handling, engaging driving experience, and affordability. All BRZ models come standard with a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder boxer engine producing 205 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque when paired with the six-speed manual transmission, and 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque when paired with the six-speed automatic transmission. Drivers appreciate the BRZ for its responsive steering, well-balanced chassis, and playful character. Common complaints include a lack of low-end torque and relatively modest power output. Some owners also report concerns about road noise and the quality of interior materials.

**Summary:**

The 2018 Subaru BRZ is generally a reliable sports car, but owners have reported issues such as valve spring failures, premature clutch wear (manual transmission), leaking rear shock absorbers, infotainment system glitches, and battery drain. The valve spring failure is addressed by a recall, so it should not be an issue if the recall service has been performed. Clutch wear is dependent on driving style, but it can be an expensive repair. The other issues are less common but should be considered when evaluating a used BRZ. Overall, while there are some potential issues to be aware of, many are not widespread and can be addressed with proper maintenance and repair.
