The 2022 Subaru XV, also known as the Crosstrek in some markets, is a subcompact SUV known for its standard all-wheel-drive, fuel efficiency, and off-road capability. The 2022 models were equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque. A plug-in hybrid version was also available. The primary transmission option is a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the XV's practicality, safety features, and reliability, but some criticisms include the base engine's lack of power and the sometimes-sluggish CVT performance.

**Engine**

**2.0-Liter Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure warning light illuminating or noticing a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The dealership may perform an oil consumption test to determine the extent of the issue. If consumption exceeds Subaru's specifications, repairs can range from replacing piston rings to potentially replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder Engine**

No Issues Found

**Electric Motor**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is struggling to find the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: A software update for the TCU (Transmission Control Unit) might be available to improve shifting logic. In more severe cases, the CVT may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for software update; $3,000 - $8,000+ for CVT replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Wheel Bearings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear or failure of the rear wheel bearings. Symptoms include a humming or grinding noise from the rear of the vehicle, which increases with speed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ per wheel bearing
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dead Battery/Electrical Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report instances of the battery draining quickly, particularly if the vehicle sits for a few days without being driven. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the electrical system to identify parasitic drain. This could involve testing individual circuits to find the source of the drain (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory). Replacement of the battery if it has been damaged by repeated deep discharges.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for battery replacement; $100 - $500+ for electrical diagnosis and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system becomes unresponsive, freezes, or crashes intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: Software update for the infotainment system. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced if software updates do not resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates (usually covered under warranty); $500 - $1500+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises from Dashboard or Door Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard or door panels, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identification and insulation of the source of the noise. This may involve tightening loose fasteners, applying felt tape to contact points, or replacing worn clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Subaru XV/Crosstrek presents a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. While the infotainment glitches and interior noises are more of an annoyance, issues like CVT hesitation, electrical drain, and potential wheel bearing failures could lead to substantial repair costs. Owners should be vigilant in monitoring oil levels due to reported consumption issues.
