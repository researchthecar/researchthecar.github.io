The 2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek is a compact crossover known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and off-road capability. It was offered with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate its practicality, fuel economy, and standard AWD. Common dislikes include its relatively slow acceleration and somewhat noisy cabin.

    * Solution: Replacing the piston rings may resolve the issue in some cases, but this is a major repair. In some instances, Subaru has offered partial reimbursement for these repairs. Regular oil level checks are also recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Spring Recall**
    * Description/Symptoms: A small number of 2015 XV Crosstreks were included in a recall for potentially defective valve springs. This could lead to engine stalling or failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected valve springs by a Subaru dealer under the recall.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Covered by recall)
    * Recalls: WRG-18

**Summary**

The 2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek, while generally reliable, can suffer from a few notable issues. Excessive oil consumption and CVT transmission problems are the most significant concerns in terms of potential repair costs. Valve spring recall is a major concern if the affected vehicles were not already repaired. Electrical issues like battery drain can be a nuisance. While some of these issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive to address, so potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect any used XV Crosstrek before purchasing.
