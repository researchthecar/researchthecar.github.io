The 2018 Subaru XV, also known as the Crosstrek in some markets, is a compact crossover known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. The 2018 model is part of the second generation of the XV. All models are equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder boxer engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The XV is available with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the XV for its off-road capabilities (for its class), comfortable ride, and good fuel economy. Common complaints revolve around its somewhat underpowered engine and occasional issues with the infotainment system.
