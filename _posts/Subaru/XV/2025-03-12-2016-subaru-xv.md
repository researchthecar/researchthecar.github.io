The 2016 Subaru XV, also known as the Crosstrek, is a compact crossover SUV that combines the practicality of a hatchback with the ruggedness of an SUV. It was offered with a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the XV for its standard all-wheel-drive system, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include the engine's lack of power, especially when fully loaded or driving uphill, and the CVT's sometimes sluggish response.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, engine knocking, and in severe cases, engine damage.
    *   Solution: Oil consumption tests can be performed by a qualified mechanic to determine the exact amount of oil being burned. If excessive, possible solutions include replacing the piston rings, valve stem seals, or in extreme cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues of the engine stalling while driving, typically occurring at low speeds or when idling.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is necessary to determine the cause of the stall. This could be due to a faulty mass airflow sensor, a vacuum leak, or issues with the idle air control valve. Repair may involve replacing the faulty component or addressing the underlying issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Lineartronic CVT**

*   **CVT Shudder/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced shuddering or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds or when the transmission is cold. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the correct gear ratio.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid flush and replacement with Subaru-approved CVT fluid may help alleviate the issue. In some cases, a software update or complete CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) to $4,000+ (CVT replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that wheel bearings fail sooner than expected. Symptoms include a humming or grinding noise that increases with vehicle speed, especially when turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing(s) is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per wheel bearing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dead Battery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the car battery frequently dying. This can be caused by a parasitic drain, a faulty alternator, or a weak battery.
    * Solution: Replacing the battery, inspecting the charging system (alternator and voltage regulator), and identifying and fixing any parasitic draws.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues include freezing, lagging, unresponsive touch screen, and Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available) may resolve some issues. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update) to $500+ (head unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained about the windshield being prone to cracking easily from small impacts or temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Windshield replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2016 Subaru XV/Crosstrek presents a mixed bag of potential issues. The most concerning are the potential for excessive oil consumption in the engine and the shuddering/hesitation issues with the CVT transmission, as these can lead to significant repair costs. While some issues, such as infotainment system problems and dead battery issues, are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, like premature wheel bearing failure and windshield cracking, can be a recurring nuisance. Overall, while the XV offers a comfortable ride and standard AWD, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
