**2019 Subaru XV**

The 2019 Subaru XV is a compact crossover SUV that offers a comfortable and fuel-efficient ride. It comes with a standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Buyers can also opt for a more powerful 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that generates 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, mated to a CVT or a six-speed manual transmission.
