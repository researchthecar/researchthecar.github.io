The 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek is a compact crossover known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and slightly raised suspension for light off-road capability. The 2014 XV Crosstrek was only available with one engine option, the 2.0-liter horizontally-opposed four-cylinder (boxer) engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praised the XV Crosstrek for its practicality, fuel economy, and all-weather capability, but some common complaints include the lack of power, especially when fully loaded or going uphill, and the somewhat basic interior.

**Summary**

The 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine problems, particularly excessive oil consumption and head gasket leaks, can be costly to repair if not addressed promptly. The CVT transmission is another area of concern, with valve body and torque converter issues potentially leading to expensive repairs or even complete transmission replacement. Suspension and electrical issues are also present, but occur less frequently. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, pay attention to any unusual noises or symptoms during a test drive, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, especially regarding the CVT transmission and potential engine issues.
