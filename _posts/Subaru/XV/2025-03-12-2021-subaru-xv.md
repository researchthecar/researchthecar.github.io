The 2021 Subaru XV, also known as the Crosstrek in some markets, is a compact SUV that appeals to buyers seeking a blend of practicality, off-road capability, and fuel efficiency. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder boxer engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). A more powerful 2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine, producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, became available in some trim levels for the 2021 model year, exclusively paired with the CVT. Owners generally appreciate the XV's standard all-wheel-drive system, comfortable ride, and ample cargo space for its size. Common dislikes include the base engine's perceived lack of power, especially when fully loaded or driving uphill, and the sometimes sluggish response of the CVT.
