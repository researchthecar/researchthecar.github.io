### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Subaru XV presents a generally solid reliability record, with its standard AWD being a significant advantage. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the 2.0L Boxer engine's potential for oil consumption and coolant leaks, and the CVT transmission's occasional hesitation. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system's Bluetooth, and minor exterior light condensation are also noted.

The manual transmission and most other systems, including suspension, exterior body, and interior trim, are considered robust. Overall, the XV is a dependable choice, especially if routine checks and addressing minor issues promptly are maintained.
