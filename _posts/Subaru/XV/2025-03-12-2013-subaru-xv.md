The 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek is a compact crossover known for its fuel efficiency, standard all-wheel drive, and rugged styling. The XV Crosstrek came standard with a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed (boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. While praised for its practicality and off-road capability, some owners have noted its somewhat underpowered engine and basic interior. It came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission).

**Engine**

**2.0L FB20 Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating and the need to add a quart or more of oil frequently.
    * Solution: In some cases, Subaru has issued Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) addressing oil consumption concerns. The solutions can range from software updates to re-flashing the ECM or, in severe cases, replacement of the piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ for piston ring replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes often indicate misfires in one or more cylinders.
    * Solution: Replacing faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or addressing vacuum leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the cause and parts needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Jutter/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a juddering or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like a slight shaking or surging.
    * Solution: In some instances, a CVT fluid change using Subaru's specified fluid can alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body or full CVT replacement is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300+ for fluid change; $1,500 - $5,000+ for valve body or CVT replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Rear Wheel Bearings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Humming, grinding, or roaring noise coming from the rear wheels, particularly noticeable at higher speeds.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ per wheel, depending on the shop and parts used.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Head Unit Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent freezing, crashing, or failure to respond to inputs on the factory head unit. Bluetooth connectivity issues can also arise.
    * Solution: Software updates (if available) or replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ depending on the replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sun Visor Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sun visors fail to stay in the upright position and sag down, obstructing the driver's view.
    * Solution: Replacement of the sun visors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per visor, depending on whether it is replaced with OEM parts.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**
The 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek has some notable issues. Engine issues like oil consumption and misfires can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to more costly repairs. The CVT transmission can experience juddering, potentially leading to expensive repairs. Suspension issues like wheel bearing failures are also common. The interior has issues with the sun visors sagging. Overall, while the XV Crosstrek is known for its reliability, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor potential repair costs into their purchasing decision.
