The 2015 Subaru XV Crosstrek is a compact crossover SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and rugged styling. The sole engine option for this model year is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder horizontally opposed (Boxer) engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Crosstrek's fuel economy, off-road capability, and reliability. However, some common complaints revolve around its relatively low horsepower and acceleration performance, road noise, and the CVT transmission's behavior.
