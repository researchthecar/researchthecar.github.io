The 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek, also known as the Subaru Crosstrek in later years, is a compact crossover SUV that offers practicality, fuel efficiency, and Subaru's renowned all-wheel-drive system. The 2014 model was exclusively available with a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder (boxer) engine, producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Crosstrek for its fuel economy, ground clearance, and all-weather capability. Common complaints revolve around its somewhat sluggish acceleration, especially when fully loaded or going uphill, and the noise of the CVT transmission.
