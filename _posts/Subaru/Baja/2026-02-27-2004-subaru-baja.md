### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Subaru Baja, while offering a unique blend of utility and car-like comfort, presents some common reliability concerns typical of vehicles of its era. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the engine, particularly head gasket leaks on both naturally aspirated and turbocharged variants, and potential oil leaks. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting or slipping. Suspension components like struts and shocks are also noted for wear. Electrical issues such as failing window regulators and alternators are not uncommon. Externally, rust can be a concern on the rear quarter panels, and the bed liner may delaminate. Internally, the HVAC blower motor is a known failure point. Despite these potential issues, many owners find the Baja to be a durable and capable vehicle when properly maintained, with most repairs being manageable within reasonable cost ranges for its age.
