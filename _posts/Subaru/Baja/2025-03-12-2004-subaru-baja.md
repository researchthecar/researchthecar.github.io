The 2004 Subaru Baja is a unique vehicle, blending the practicality of a small pickup truck with the comfort and handling of a sedan. The 2004 Baja came with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Baja's all-wheel drive capability, versatility, and distinctive styling. However, common complaints include the somewhat limited cargo bed size and the issues associated with aging Subaru engines and transmissions.

Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting and clutch wear, are also common. Suspension components can also wear out, leading to a reduced ride quality. Electrical and interior issues are less severe but still worth considering. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, but potential buyers should factor in the age of the vehicle and the potential for significant repairs when considering a purchase.
