The 2006 Subaru Baja is a unique vehicle that blends the practicality of a pickup truck with the comfort of a Subaru wagon. It was offered with two engine options: a naturally aspirated 2.5L SOHC EJ25 engine producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5L DOHC EJ255 engine producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Baja's versatility, its all-wheel-drive capability, and its distinctive styling. However, some common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy (especially with the turbo engine), limited rear passenger space, and some of the reliability issues that plague older Subaru models.

**Summary**

The 2006 Subaru Baja, while a unique and desirable vehicle, does suffer from some common issues. The most significant issues involve the engine, particularly head gasket failures and oil leaks. The turbocharged models can also experience turbocharger problems. Suspension components tend to wear out, and electrical gremlins can appear due to grounding issues. Rust can also be a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing gaskets to more substantial expenses like replacing the turbocharger or performing head gasket work. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, including the cost of maintenance and repairs.
