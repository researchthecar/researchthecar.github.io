### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Subaru Baja, while a unique and capable vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and Subaru's engineering of that era. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the engine, particularly head gasket failures on both naturally aspirated and turbocharged variants, and potential oil leaks. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can also arise. Electrical components like the alternator and BCM can be sources of trouble.
