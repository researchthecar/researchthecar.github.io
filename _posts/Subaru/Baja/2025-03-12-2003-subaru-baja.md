The 2003 Subaru Baja is a unique vehicle, blending the functionality of a small pickup truck with the comfort of a Subaru wagon. It came standard with a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated engine producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. Some models were equipped with a 2.5L turbocharged engine producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Baja's all-wheel drive capability and distinctive styling, but common complaints revolve around its age-related maintenance needs and fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2003 Subaru Baja, while a unique and desirable vehicle, is now subject to age-related problems. Engine issues such as head gasket failure and oil leaks are relatively common and can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic transmission's torque converter, can also arise. Suspension components like struts and wheel bearings are also common failure points. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can be quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect any used 2003 Subaru Baja and be prepared for potential maintenance and repair expenses.
