The 2005 Subaru Baja is a unique vehicle, a blend of a passenger car and a pickup truck. It came standard with a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated engine producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. An optional 2.5L turbocharged engine was also available, boosting output to 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Baja's versatility, all-wheel drive capability, and distinctive styling. However, some common complaints include limited bed space, lower fuel economy compared to similar sedans, and the potential for rust.

Head gasket failures (for naturally aspirated engines) and turbocharger issues (for turbocharged engines) can be quite costly. Rust is a common problem, especially in areas with harsh winters. While the Baja offers unique versatility, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision and budget for repairs.
