### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Subaru Baja is a unique vehicle with a generally acceptable reliability record for its age. The most common significant issues tend to be related to the engine, particularly head gasket failures on both the naturally aspirated and turbocharged variants, and oil leaks. Transmission issues, while not epidemic, can occur with higher mileage automatics. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are typical wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and alternators, are also reported. Exterior concerns often revolve around rust, especially in the rear quarter panels, and potential delamination of the bed liner. Interior issues are less common but can include HVAC blower motor failures. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are crucial for maintaining the Baja's reliability.
