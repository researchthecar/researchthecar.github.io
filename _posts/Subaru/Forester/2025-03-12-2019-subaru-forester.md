The 2019 Subaru Forester is a popular compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and good safety ratings. The 2019 model came with a single engine option, a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder "FB25" engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque. It was exclusively paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). People generally like the Forester for its practicality, reliability, and off-road capability, while some dislike its somewhat bland styling and occasionally sluggish acceleration.
