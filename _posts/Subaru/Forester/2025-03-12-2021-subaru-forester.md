The 2021 Subaru Forester is a popular compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and excellent safety ratings. It comes equipped with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While owners generally appreciate its reliability, fuel efficiency, and practicality, some common complaints include lackluster acceleration, a somewhat noisy CVT, and certain electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**2.5L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The oil consumption issue may manifest as low oil level warnings or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: A dealer oil consumption test is often performed to determine the severity. Depending on the results, possible solutions include replacing the PCV valve or, in more severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve) - $5,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or stalling while accelerating from a stop or during low-speed maneuvers. This issue may be intermittent and difficult to replicate.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include fuel delivery issues, sensor malfunctions, or software glitches. The solution may involve updating the engine control module (ECM) software, replacing faulty sensors (e.g., mass airflow sensor, oxygen sensor), or addressing fuel system problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have described experiencing jerking or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. The CVT may feel unresponsive or exhibit a "rubber band" effect.
    *   Solution: This issue may be related to the CVT's programming. In some cases, a software update from the dealer may improve the transmission's behavior. However, more severe cases might require CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported problems with the infotainment system, including freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and malfunctioning touchscreens.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting steps may include restarting the system, updating the software, or performing a factory reset. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+ (Head Unit Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: This issue may be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component that is not shutting off properly. Diagnosis involves identifying the source of the drain and repairing or replacing the faulty component. A new battery may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (New Battery) - $500+ (Diagnosis and Repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **EyeSight System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the EyeSight driver-assist system, including false warnings, system deactivation, and failure to detect obstacles.
    *   Solution: Issues may be caused by sensor obstructions, software glitches, or camera misalignment. The solution may involve cleaning the sensors, updating the software, or recalibrating the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Cleaning Sensors) - $500+ (Recalibration)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Windshield cracking is a concern with some owners. The cracking may occur spontaneously or from small impacts. Some owners believe the issue is due to a design flaw or thinner glass.
    * Solution: Windshield replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or creaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area, especially when driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and addressing it with padding, tightening of fasteners, or replacement of worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Subaru Forester generally has a good reputation for reliability, but like any vehicle, it's not without its issues. The most common concerns relate to the engine (oil consumption), the CVT transmission (jerking), electrical components (infotainment system and battery drain), and interior rattles. While some issues can be resolved with relatively inexpensive fixes like software updates or sensor replacements, others, such as engine or CVT replacement, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase.
