The 2004 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and standard all-wheel drive. The most common engine option for this year is the 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine, producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. A turbocharged 2.5L engine was available in the XT trim. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Forester for its cargo space, all-weather capability, and longevity. Common complaints include its relatively bland styling, fuel economy, and the potential for some age-related maintenance issues.
