The 2003 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV known for its practicality, reliability, and standard all-wheel drive. The most common engine option is a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing around 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Forester's cargo space, fuel efficiency (for its class), and all-weather capability. Some common complaints include the somewhat dated interior, road noise, and potential for head gasket issues in the 2.5L engine.
