### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Subaru Forester offers a compelling package for those seeking an all-wheel-drive vehicle. Its reliability is generally good, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The most significant concern is the potential for head gasket failure on both naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines, which can be a costly repair. Automatic transmission issues like harsh shifting are also noted. On the positive side, the manual transmission and many suspension components tend to be robust. Electrical issues like instrument cluster and window regulator failures are not uncommon. Exterior rust, particularly in certain climates, and interior HVAC blower motor problems are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate many of these potential reliability concerns.
