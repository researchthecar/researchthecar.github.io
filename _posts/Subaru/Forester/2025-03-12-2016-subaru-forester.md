The 2016 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. The most common engine option is a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder Boxer engine producing 170 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. A turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, also a Boxer four-cylinder, is available on the XT trim, delivering 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5i models are typically paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 2.0XT uses a different, higher-performance CVT. Owners appreciate the Forester's reliability, practicality, and all-weather capability. However, some common complaints include the CVT's behavior (especially with the 2.5i engine), the infotainment system's responsiveness, and some reported oil consumption issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2016 Forester owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning light, engine knocking, and visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: A Subaru Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) addresses this issue, recommending an oil consumption test. If the consumption exceeds a certain threshold, Subaru may recommend replacing the piston rings or even the entire short block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**CVT (2.5i Models)**

*   **CVT Hesitation and Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation upon initial acceleration and jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds. This is a common complaint with CVTs and how they operate differently from automatic transmissions
    *   Solution: Software updates to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may improve the CVT's performance. In some cases, a CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (for software update) $4,000 - $8,000 (for CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT (2.0XT Models)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Stabilizer Bar Bushing Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported squeaking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This is often attributed to worn or dry rear stabilizer bar bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear stabilizer bar bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially in colder climates. Difficulty starting the car after short periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery with a higher-capacity AGM battery. Diagnosing and addressing any parasitic draws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset. Updating the infotainment system software to the latest version. In some cases, replacing the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for system reset or software update) $500 - $1500+ (for head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Driver's Seat Creaking/Clicking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A creaking or clicking noise coming from the driver's seat, especially during acceleration, braking, or cornering.
    *   Solution: Tightening the seat bolts. Lubricating the seat tracks and springs. In some cases, replacing the seat frame may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Subaru Forester has some notable issues, particularly regarding engine oil consumption and CVT performance. The oil consumption issue can be quite severe and expensive to fix, while the CVT problems are more often related to feel and drivability, though CVT replacements are also possible. Electrical issues with the battery and infotainment system are also reported. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have any used Forester thoroughly inspected before purchase.
