The 2013 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and reliability. Engine options include a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque (available on the XT trim). The 2.5-liter engine could be paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), while the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine was exclusively paired with a CVT. Owners generally praise the Forester for its spacious interior, good visibility, and all-weather capability. Common complaints include the relatively unrefined CVT (especially with the base engine), and some reported issues with excessive oil consumption.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report that the engine consumes an excessive amount of oil between oil changes, sometimes requiring a quart or more every 1,000-2,000 miles. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and the need for frequent oil top-offs. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    * Solution: Subaru issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) and extended the warranty for affected vehicles to address this issue. The fix often involves replacing the piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair shop.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are evident around the valve cover gasket. This may result in a burning oil smell and oil dripping onto exhaust components.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining or screeching noises from the engine bay, and potentially a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both Engine Options)**

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, jerking or shuddering during shifts, and generally rough or unpredictable behavior.
    * Solution: Replacement of the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop or during light throttle applications.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing or swaying, reduced handling stability, and noises (clunking, squeaking) from the rear suspension.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear struts/shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not driven for a few days. This can result in difficulty starting the car.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the parasitic drain, which may involve replacing the battery, or identifying and repairing faulty modules or wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Bluetooth Connectivity Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty pairing devices, intermittent disconnections, and audio distortion during calls or music playback.
    * Solution: Software updates, replacing the head unit, or repairing wiring connections.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, particularly around the headliner.
    * Solution: Cleaning and resealing the sunroof drains, or replacing the sunroof seal.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters either don't work at all or only work intermittently.
    * Solution: Replacing the seat heater element or switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Subaru Forester, while generally reliable, has some known issues. The most concerning is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, which can lead to costly repairs. CVT issues are also common and can affect driveability. Other issues, such as suspension and electrical problems, are less severe but still worth considering. The cost to fix these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history, check for signs of oil consumption, and test drive the vehicle thoroughly to identify any potential transmission issues.
