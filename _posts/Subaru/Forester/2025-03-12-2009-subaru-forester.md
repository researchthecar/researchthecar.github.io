The 2009 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV known for its practicality, standard all-wheel drive, and reliability. Available engine options included a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. This engine could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. A turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, producing 224 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque, was also available, paired exclusively with a 5-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the Forester's cargo capacity, all-weather capability, and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include the fuel economy, especially with the automatic transmission, and some concerns about reliability as the vehicles age, primarily with the 2.5L engine.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, external coolant leaks around the head gasket.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the head gaskets. Machining the cylinder heads may be necessary to ensure a proper seal.

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in oil level between oil changes, requiring frequent top-offs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In mild cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil may help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (oil change) - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency (P0420), reduced engine performance, and potential failure to pass emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
