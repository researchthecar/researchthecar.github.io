The 2014 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and reliability. It comes with two engine options: a 2.5L naturally aspirated horizontally-opposed (boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged horizontally-opposed (boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine is paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 2.0L turbo engine is exclusively paired with a CVT. Owners appreciate the Forester's spacious interior, good fuel economy (especially with the 2.5L engine), and off-road capability. Common dislikes include the CVT's sometimes sluggish response and the base engine's lack of power for some drivers, as well as infotainment system limitations.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2014 Foresters with the 2.5L engine experience excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Symptoms include the oil level dropping quickly, the oil light illuminating, and in severe cases, engine knocking.
    *   Solution: A Subaru Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) outlines a procedure involving oil consumption testing. If the vehicle fails the test, the repair may involve replacing the piston rings. In some cases, Subaru offered to cover the cost of this repair under an extended warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Airbag Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms:
    *   Solution: Replace the defective sensor
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-400
    *   Recalls: 2020 recalls for faulty sensors

**2.0L Turbocharged Engine**

**CVT (Both Engine Options)**

*   **CVT Chain Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT used in the 2014 Forester (both with the 2.5L and 2.0L turbo engines) has been reported to have issues with the chain slipping and potentially breaking. Symptoms include jerky acceleration, shuddering, loss of power, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire CVT unit is typically the required solution.

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging/Weak Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report that the rear suspension springs can sag prematurely, especially if the vehicle is frequently loaded with cargo or passengers. This can lead to a reduced ride height and a less comfortable ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear springs with new, potentially upgraded, springs is the usual fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Subaru Forester has some common issues. The most serious and potentially expensive problems relate to excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine and CVT failures in both engine options. Suspension and electrical issues are also reported. These problems range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and potential buyers should be aware of these issues when considering a used 2014 Forester. Due to the age of the vehicle, these repairs could be more frequent and expensive.
