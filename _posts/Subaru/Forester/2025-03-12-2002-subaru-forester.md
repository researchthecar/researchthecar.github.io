The 2002 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV known for its reliability, practicality, and standard all-wheel drive. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Available transmissions included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise its handling, fuel efficiency for an AWD vehicle, and cargo space. Common complaints include the car's somewhat bland styling, potential for head gasket issues, and the relatively noisy engine.
