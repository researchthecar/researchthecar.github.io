### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Subaru Forester is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly praised for its AWD system. However, potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues such as head gasket failures (especially on the 2.5L engines), oil leaks, and potential transmission problems with the automatic variant. Turbocharged models (XT) may also face turbocharger-specific issues.

Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Despite these potential drawbacks, addressing these issues proactively can ensure the longevity and continued enjoyment of this practical SUV.
