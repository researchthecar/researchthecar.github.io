The turbocharged engine variants can experience turbocharger or direct injection system issues. The CVT transmission, while generally robust, has seen some reports of fluid leaks or overheating. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. The manual transmission, suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread significant problems. Regular maintenance, especially for the CVT fluid, is crucial for long-term dependability.
