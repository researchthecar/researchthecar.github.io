The 2020 Subaru Forester is a popular compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and good safety ratings. It's powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder Boxer engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Many owners appreciate the Forester's comfortable ride, fuel efficiency, and cargo space, while some criticisms include the somewhat underwhelming acceleration and the occasionally unrefined operation of the CVT.
