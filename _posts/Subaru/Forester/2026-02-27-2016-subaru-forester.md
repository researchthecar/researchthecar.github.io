### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Subaru Forester presents a generally strong reliability record, particularly with its standard AWD and practical design. The most frequently cited concerns revolve around the 2.5L engine's potential for oil consumption and, less commonly, head gasket issues. The CVT transmission can sometimes exhibit minor performance quirks, often addressable with software updates. Electrical issues, such as infotainment screen glitches and battery drain, are also noted but not universally prevalent. The turbocharged 2.0L engine and manual transmission variants appear to be less prone to widespread issues. Overall, proactive maintenance and attention to oil levels are key for owners of the 2.5L engine. Despite these points, the Forester remains a dependable choice in its segment.
