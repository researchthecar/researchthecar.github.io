The 2015 Subaru Forester is a popular compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine was paired with either a 6-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 2.0L turbo was exclusively paired with a CVT. People generally like the Forester for its reliability, practicality, and off-road capability, while some dislike its relatively bland styling and the sometimes-unrefined nature of the CVT.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2015 Foresters with the 2.5L engine experienced excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms included the low oil light illuminating, the need to add oil frequently, and in severe cases, engine damage.
    *   Solution: Subaru issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) 02-157-14R addressing this issue. The recommended fix involved an oil consumption test, and if the engine failed the test, replacement of the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Oxygen Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Oxygen sensor is located on the exhaust, and monitors the amount of oxygen leaving the engine. Over time, these can go bad which can cause symptoms like engine misfires, rough running, poor fuel economy, or trouble codes such as P0131, P0137, P0171, P0172, or P0420.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Engine**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both Engine Options)**

*   **CVT Chain Slippage/Juddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported experiencing CVT chain slippage, juddering, or hesitation, particularly during acceleration or when climbing hills. This could be caused by wear on the CVT chain or issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change could alleviate the problem temporarily. However, if the issue persisted, a CVT valve body replacement or complete CVT replacement was often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ for valve body replacement, $4,000 - $8,000+ for complete CVT replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Strut Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported that the rear struts sagged prematurely, leading to a lower ride height in the rear and potentially affecting handling. In some cases, the struts could also fail completely, resulting in a bouncy ride and reduced stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear struts and potentially the springs if they were also worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported issues with premature battery drain on the 2015 Forester. This issue can cause the car to not start, especially after sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: This issue can be tricky to diagnose. Some have been successful by replacing the battery with a high-quality AGM battery and ensuring all electrical connections are clean and tight. Other times the issue is a faulty component that is draining power.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Unit/Infotainment System Freezing or Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Sometimes a software update or a system reset can resolve the issue. If not, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent issues with Bluetooth connectivity, including difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, and poor audio quality.
    *   Solution: Attempting to update the infotainment software or unpairing and repairing devices can sometimes resolve the problem. In some cases, the Bluetooth module itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Subaru Forester, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most concerning are the excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine and potential CVT problems, both of which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues and suspension problems are also relatively common. While not all Foresters will experience these issues, it's important to have a pre-purchase inspection performed to check for these potential problems. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
