The 2008 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and reliability. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L DOHC turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 224 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Forester's all-weather capability, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. Common dislikes include the somewhat bland styling, road noise, and the 4-speed automatic transmission's performance.
