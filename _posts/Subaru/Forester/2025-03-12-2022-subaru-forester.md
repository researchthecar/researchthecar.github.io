The 2022 Subaru Forester is a popular compact SUV known for its practicality, standard all-wheel drive, and reputation for reliability. It's powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Forester for its spacious interior, good visibility, and off-road capability, while common complaints revolve around the somewhat lackluster engine performance and the behavior of the CVT transmission.

**Engine**

**2.5L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating and noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The fix varies. Some have had success with switching to a different oil type or viscosity. In more severe cases, the dealer might perform an oil consumption test and potentially replace piston rings or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or stalling upon acceleration, particularly from a stop or at low speeds.
    *   Solution: The issue may be related to the fuel system or engine management software. Potential fixes include software updates or replacement of faulty sensors (e.g., mass airflow sensor).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers experience a jerking or hesitation sensation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. It can also feel like a "rubber band" effect, where the engine revs but the car doesn't accelerate immediately.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) are often the first attempt at resolving the issue. In more severe cases, replacement of the CVT may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A whining or unusual noise coming from the transmission, particularly during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is needed. Potential causes include low transmission fluid, worn internal components, or a failing torque converter. Depending on the cause, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100+ (diagnosis) - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, resulting in difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify parasitic drain. Common culprits include faulty infotainment systems, aftermarket accessories, or a defective battery. Replacement of the battery or repair of the draining component is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (battery replacement) - $500+ (electrical diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often the first step. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (infotainment system replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their windshield is prone to cracking easily, even from small impacts.
    * Solution: Windshield replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Vibrations**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises coming from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Locating and securing the source of the rattle. This may involve tightening loose screws, adding insulation, or replacing faulty clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the severity and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Subaru Forester, while generally reliable, does have some common issues reported by owners. Engine problems such as excessive oil consumption and hesitation can be concerning, potentially leading to costly repairs. The CVT transmission may exhibit jerky behavior or unusual noises, warranting attention. Electrical issues, like battery drain and infotainment system malfunctions, can also be frustrating. Interior rattles are common but usually less severe. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic. Depending on the issue, repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to potentially several thousand dollars for major component replacements.
