**Introduction:**
The 2012 Subaru Forester is a compact SUV that comes in four trims (2.5X, 2.5X Premium, 2.5X Limited, and 2.5XT Premium). It is powered by a standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine that produces 170 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. A 2.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine that produces 224 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque is optional on the 2.5XT Premium trim.
