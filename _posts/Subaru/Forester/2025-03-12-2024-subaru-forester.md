The 2024 Subaru Forester is a popular compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and reliability. It comes standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Drivers often praise the Forester for its spacious interior, excellent visibility, and off-road capability. Some criticisms include the somewhat lackluster acceleration and the occasionally noisy CVT.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil warning lights and noticeable oil level decrease on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Subaru has issued Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) related to oil consumption. The first step is often an oil consumption test performed by a dealership. If consumption is excessive, potential fixes may include replacing piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Lineartronic CVT**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation or jerking, particularly during low-speed acceleration or when transitioning between different driving modes.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve this issue. In some cases, a CVT fluid change may be recommended. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) to $5,000+ (CVT replacement)

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dead Battery**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure, requiring jump starts or battery replacement sooner than expected. This can be caused by parasitic draw from electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery with an upgraded AGM battery and diagnosing any potential parasitic draws in the electrical system.
