The 2023 Subaru Forester is a popular compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and safety features. It is powered by a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder boxer engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque. All Forester models come equipped with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the Forester for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and good visibility.
