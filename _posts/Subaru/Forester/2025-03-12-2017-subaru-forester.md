The 2017 Subaru Forester is a popular compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and reliability. It came standard with a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque and mated to either a 6-speed manual transmission (base model only) or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine was also available, producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a CVT. Owners often praise the Forester for its spacious interior, good visibility, and off-road capability. Common complaints include the relatively unrefined CVT in the base model, road noise, and somewhat dated interior styling.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil level warning light illuminating, the engine running rough, or eventually engine damage if left unattended.
    * Solution: Subaru issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) addressing this issue, which may involve performing an oil consumption test. If excessive consumption is confirmed, possible solutions include replacing the piston rings or the entire engine block.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $7,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed (piston rings vs. engine replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leak around the valve cover area, visible oil residue on the engine block. Can cause burning smell and potential fire hazard if oil drips onto hot exhaust components.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling or whining noise from the turbocharger, check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) - Both Engine Options**

* **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh shifting, jerking, or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds.
    * Solution: A software update for the CVT control module may resolve some of these issues. In more severe cases, CVT valve body replacement or full CVT replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for software update. $800 - $1,500 for valve body replacement. $4,000 - $8,000 for full CVT replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Strut Mount Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Creaking or squeaking noise from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    * Solution: Replace the rear strut mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery drains quickly, especially after the car has been sitting for a few days, leading to difficulty starting or a dead battery.
    * Solution: Diagnose parasitic drain (aftermarket accessories often cause this), replace the battery, or replace the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for a new battery, $300 - $500 for an alternator replacement, $100 - $300 for diagnosing and fixing a parasitic draw.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Head Unit Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, reboot randomly, or experience Bluetooth connectivity issues.

**Summary**

The 2017 Subaru Forester has several common issues, with the most concerning being excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine and potential CVT issues. Turbocharger failures are also a concern for the 2.0L engine. Electrical issues like battery drain and head unit problems are relatively common, as is a propensity for windshield cracking. Dashboard cracking is mostly a cosmetic issue, though replacing the dashboard can be costly. Overall, while the Forester is generally reliable, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive engine or transmission repairs.
