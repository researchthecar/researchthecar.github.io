The 2018 Subaru Forester is a popular compact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and good safety ratings. The 2018 model year offered two engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine in the Forester XT, producing 250 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine was paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission), while the 2.0L Turbo was also mated to a CVT. Owners appreciate the Forester's reliability, practicality, and off-road capability. Common complaints include lackluster acceleration with the base engine, road noise, and the design of the infotainment system.

The most concerning issues are excessive oil consumption with the 2.5L engine and potential CVT problems, as these can lead to major engine or transmission repairs. Electrical issues, particularly with battery drain and the infotainment system, are also common.
