The 2021 Subaru WRX STI is a high-performance sedan known for its turbocharged engine, sporty handling, and iconic all-wheel-drive system. It came equipped with a 2.5-liter turbocharged horizontally-opposed four-cylinder (boxer) engine producing 310 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual transmission was the only transmission option available. Owners typically praise the car's driving dynamics, turbocharged power, and overall performance capabilities. Common criticisms include the relatively low fuel economy, somewhat dated interior design, and firm ride quality.

**Summary:**

The 2021 Subaru WRX STI, while a performance-oriented vehicle, does have some common issues. The most concerning potential issues are related to the engine (oil consumption and ringland failure), which can lead to costly repairs. The infotainment system can be a source of frustration, and general maintenance items like clutches may require replacement sooner than expected if the car is driven aggressively. Overall, while the STI is a fun and capable car, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
