### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Subaru WRX STI is a capable performance car, but its high-strung nature means certain components, particularly the engine and transmission, can be prone to issues if not maintained meticulously or if subjected to aggressive driving. The EJ257 engine, while powerful, has documented weaknesses like piston ring lands and head gaskets that can fail under stress. The manual transmission, while generally robust, can experience clutch wear and synchro issues. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior are generally reliable. Owners should prioritize regular maintenance, use high-quality fluids, and be mindful of driving habits to mitigate potential reliability concerns.
