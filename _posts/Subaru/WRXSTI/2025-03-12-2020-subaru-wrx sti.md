The 2020 Subaru WRX STI is a performance-oriented sedan known for its turbocharged engine, all-wheel-drive system, and sporty handling. It comes exclusively with a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 310 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed manual transmission. People often praise the STI for its engaging driving experience, rally-inspired performance, and strong aftermarket support. Some common criticisms include the relatively outdated interior, firm ride quality, and less-than-stellar fuel economy.
