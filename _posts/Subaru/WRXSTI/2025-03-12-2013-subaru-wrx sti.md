*   **Ringland Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking noises from the engine, loss of power, increased oil consumption, and ultimately engine failure. Often attributed to detonation, pre-ignition, or lean running conditions.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement with stronger pistons. Ensuring proper tuning and addressing any underlying issues causing detonation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported excessive oil consumption. This may be related to the ringland failure.
    *   Solution: Some owners have changed to a heavier oil to try and reduce the oil consumption
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 - $50
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the turbocharger, loss of boost pressure, reduced engine power, and potentially smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Inspecting oil lines and intake system for blockage or damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Summary**

The 2013 Subaru WRX STI is a high-performance vehicle that can be rewarding to own, but it is prone to some specific issues. The most serious and potentially expensive concern is engine-related, particularly ringland failure, which can lead to costly engine rebuilds or replacements. Transmission issues, such as clutch failure and gear grinding, are also common and can be expensive to address. Other issues, such as electrical or suspension problems, are generally less severe but still require attention.
