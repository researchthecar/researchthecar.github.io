### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Subaru WRX STI is a capable performance car, but its high-strung engine and transmission require diligent maintenance, especially if driven hard. The 2.5L turbocharged engine is prone to issues like head gasket failure and piston ring land damage, particularly if not properly maintained or if subjected to aggressive driving without adequate cooling. The manual transmission, while robust, can experience accelerated clutch wear and synchro issues. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior generally hold up well, with no widespread critical failures reported. Owners should prioritize regular fluid changes, monitor engine temperatures, and address any unusual noises or performance changes promptly to mitigate potential costly repairs.
