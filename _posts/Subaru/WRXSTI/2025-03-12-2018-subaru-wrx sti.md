The 2018 Subaru WRX STI is a performance-oriented sedan known for its turbocharged engine, all-wheel drive, and sporty handling. It's equipped exclusively with a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder boxer engine producing 305 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise its engaging driving experience and rally-inspired heritage, but some criticisms include its firm ride, dated interior, and relatively poor fuel economy. Common complaints include engine reliability issues, particularly related to ringland failure, and a notchy transmission.
