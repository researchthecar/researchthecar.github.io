**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Flat-Four (EJ257)**

*   **Ringland Failure/Piston Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a widespread issue. Symptoms can include loss of power, misfires, excessive oil consumption, knocking sounds, and eventually engine failure. It's often triggered by aggressive tuning or high boost levels but can occur even on stock vehicles.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement with stronger pistons. Upgrading to forged pistons is a common preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and if it is rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many 2015 WRX STI owners report higher than normal oil consumption, sometimes requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Sometimes switching to a higher viscosity oil can help. Other times it requires more invasive work like a piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for oil changes. $3,000 - $6,000+ for engine work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and/or coolant mixing with oil.
    *   Solution: Head gasket replacement. It's often recommended to machine the cylinder head surface to ensure proper sealing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
