**1992 Subaru Loyale**

The 1992 Subaru Loyale is a compact station wagon that was available with two engine options: a 1.8-liter flat-four engine producing 92 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.2-liter flat-four engine producing 110 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Loyale was praised for its all-wheel drive system, which provided excellent traction in slippery conditions. However, it was criticized for its poor fuel economy and lack of power.
