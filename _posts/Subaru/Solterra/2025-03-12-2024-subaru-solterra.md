The 2024 Subaru Solterra is Subaru's first all-electric SUV, developed in partnership with Toyota (Toyota bZ4X). It is powered by a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system producing 215 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque. The Solterra is praised for its comfortable ride, standard safety features, and all-wheel-drive capability. Some common dislikes include the limited range compared to other EVs, infotainment system usability, and slower charging speeds.
