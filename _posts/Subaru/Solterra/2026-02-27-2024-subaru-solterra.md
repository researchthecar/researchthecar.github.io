# 2024 Subaru Solterra

### Overview
The 2024 Subaru Solterra, an all-electric SUV developed in partnership with Toyota, aims to blend Subaru's renowned capability with zero-emission driving. As an early model year for this platform, initial reliability data is still emerging, but early indications suggest a generally solid performance. The Solterra utilizes a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system and a substantial battery pack, focusing on practicality and off-road readiness for an EV. Owners have reported a few specific areas of concern, primarily related to software and charging, which are not uncommon for new electric vehicle architectures. However, core mechanical and powertrain components have shown good resilience in early reports, aligning with Subaru's reputation for durability. Ongoing monitoring will be crucial as more vehicles accumulate mileage.
