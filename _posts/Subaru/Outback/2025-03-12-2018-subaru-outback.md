The 2018 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its reliability, standard all-wheel drive, and spacious interior. Two engine options were available: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally praise the Outback for its comfortable ride, practicality, and off-road capability, while some criticize its somewhat uninspired styling and the performance of the base engine.
