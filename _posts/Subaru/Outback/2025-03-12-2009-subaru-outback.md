The 2009 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and reliability. Engine options for the 2009 Outback included a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L DOHC naturally aspirated 6-cylinder engine producing 245 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L engine was only available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Outback for its go-anywhere capability and comfortable ride, while some complaints center on its fuel economy, particularly with the larger engine, and some reported maintenance issues.

**Summary**

The 2009 Subaru Outback, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most significant and costly is the potential for head gasket failure in the 2.5L engine. Other engine and transmission issues, such as oil leaks and slipping transmissions, can also be expensive to address. Suspension wear and tear, particularly in the rear, is another area to inspect. Electrical problems such as oxygen sensor failure can also occur. Rust can be a problem in certain regions. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can quickly add up, making it essential to have a pre-purchase inspection performed.
