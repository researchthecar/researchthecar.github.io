The 2016 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon known for its practicality, safety, and standard all-wheel-drive. It offered two engine choices: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine making 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Outback for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and off-road capability. Criticisms often include the somewhat unrefined CVT transmission, and the underwhelming performance of the base 2.5L engine when fully loaded.

**Summary**

The 2016 Subaru Outback has a few common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine and CVT transmission problems, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment issues, can be annoying but are typically less expensive to address. Although the severity of issues varies, it is advisable to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic, paying particular attention to the engine oil level and transmission performance.
