The 2011 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and reliability. Available engine options include a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L naturally aspirated six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (paired with the 2.5L engine only) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Outback's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and all-weather capability. Common complaints include the CVT's performance and the 2.5L engine's fuel economy, along with some concerns about reliability issues that arise as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil at a higher-than-normal rate, often requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Subaru issued a service bulletin and may have offered repair or replacement of the short block. In some cases, replacing piston rings and valve stem seals is done as an alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission exhibits rough or jerky behavior during acceleration or deceleration, particularly at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, reprogramming the transmission control module (TCM) can improve shift quality. Replacement of the entire CVT may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for TCM reprogramming, $4,000 - $6,000+ for transmission replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Weakness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension may sag over time, particularly when carrying passengers or cargo. This can lead to a bumpy ride and reduced ground clearance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear springs and/or shocks with heavier-duty components can address the issue. Adding spring spacers can also provide a temporary lift.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after sitting for a short period.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the parasitic drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working or function intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust develops on the rear wheel arches, particularly in areas with heavy road salt use.
    *   Solution: Repair involves sanding, rust treatment, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Subaru Outback has a mix of potential issues, with the most concerning being the excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine and the CVT transmission problems. Both of these issues can lead to costly repairs. Other, less severe, problems include suspension sag, electrical issues, and interior cracking. While the Outback is generally reliable, it's essential to inspect these areas when considering a used model. The severity and cost of repairs vary depending on the specific issue, but addressing these potential problems can help ensure the longevity and reliability of the vehicle.
