The 2023 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its practicality, standard all-wheel drive, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the Outback for its spacious interior, off-road capabilities, and safety features. Common complaints often revolve around the infotainment system's responsiveness and occasional CVT behavior.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, the need to frequently top off oil, and in some cases, a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The most common solutions involve closely monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed. In more severe cases, dealers may perform an oil consumption test to determine the extent of the issue. Depending on the results, possible fixes range from replacing the PCV valve to more significant engine work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: The cost to fix can range from a simple PCV valve replacement ($50 - $200) to more extensive engine repairs (potentially $1,000+).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Turbocharged Engine**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Lineartronic CVT (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can manifest as a momentary lag when pressing the accelerator or a sudden, jerky movement during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) are often the first step in addressing this issue. In some cases, a complete CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. CVT replacement can range from $3,000-$8,000 depending on if done at the dealer or an independent shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint involves the infotainment system freezing, lagging, or being unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio controls, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Subaru are often released to address these issues. Performing a hard reset of the system or, in more severe cases, replacing the head unit might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are usually free. Head unit replacement can range from $500-$1500.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Dead Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after short periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Dealers often perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the battery drain. Replacing the battery with a higher-capacity unit or addressing the underlying electrical issue are common solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement typically costs $150-$400. Resolving parasitic draw issues can vary greatly depending on the cause ($100-$1,000+).

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling or squeaking noises emanating from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: The source of the noise needs to be identified and isolated. This may involve tightening loose components, adding padding to reduce friction, or replacing worn parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: The cost to fix varies greatly depending on the source of the noise, but it can range from a simple DIY fix to more extensive repairs costing $100-$500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Subaru Outback generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, but some owners have encountered issues, primarily with the infotainment system, excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, and some transmission hesitation. The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor annoyances resolved by software updates, while others require more costly repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and consider having a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used vehicle.
