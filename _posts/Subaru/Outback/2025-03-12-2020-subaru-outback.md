The 2020 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its practicality, standard all-wheel drive, and comfortable ride. It offered two engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine delivering 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). People often praise the Outback for its spacious interior, off-road capability, and comprehensive safety features. Common complaints include the sometimes sluggish acceleration of the base engine, and the infotainment system's complexity.

**Summary:**

The 2020 Subaru Outback experiences a range of issues, with electrical problems being a prominent concern, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain. Interior rattles and vibrations can be annoying, while exterior issues like easily cracked windshields add to the cost of ownership. Engine and transmission issues, such as excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine and CVT hesitation, can be costly to repair. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs, so thorough inspection and maintenance are crucial.
