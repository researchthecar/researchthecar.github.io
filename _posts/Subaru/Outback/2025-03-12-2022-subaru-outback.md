The 2022 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and off-road capability. It comes with two engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the Outback for its safety features, comfortable ride, and cargo capacity. However, some common complaints include the infotainment system's responsiveness and complexity, as well as occasional issues with the CVT.

**Summary**

The 2022 Subaru Outback, while generally reliable, does have some reported issues. The most concerning issues relate to potential engine oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, CVT hesitation, infotainment glitches, and premature wear of rear wheel bearings. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to costly repairs. The infotainment glitches can often be resolved with software updates, but engine and transmission repairs are generally much more expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor them into their purchasing decision.
