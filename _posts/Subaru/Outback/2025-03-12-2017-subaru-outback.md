The 2017 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its practicality, standard all-wheel drive, and ample cargo space. It came with two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Outback's reliability, fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.5L), and comfortable ride. Common complaints include the infotainment system's responsiveness and the CVT's sometimes uninspiring driving experience.

**Summary:**

The 2017 Subaru Outback, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. The most concerning is the excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, which can be costly to repair. CVT issues can also be expensive, but software updates may provide a fix. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are less severe but can still be frustrating. Windshield cracks are a common nuisance. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed, paying close attention to oil levels, transmission performance, and electrical system functionality.
