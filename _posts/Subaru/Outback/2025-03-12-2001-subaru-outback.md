The 2001 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon known for its reliability, all-wheel drive capability, and practicality. It offered two engine options: a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L DOHC naturally aspirated six-cylinder engine producing 212 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, depending on the model. Owners often appreciate the Outback's versatility, comfortable ride, and all-weather performance. However, some common complaints include issues related to head gaskets, suspension components, and rust.

**Engine**

**2.5L SOHC Engine**

* **Head Gasket Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss (internal or external), white smoke from exhaust, coolant bubbling in the overflow tank, and milky oil. Can occur between 80,000-150,000 miles.
    * Solution: Replace the head gaskets. It's advisable to have the cylinder heads checked for flatness and resurfaced if necessary. Subaru updated the head gasket design later to address this issue, so using the updated gaskets is recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (depending on the shop and additional repairs needed, such as head resurfacing or valve work).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil drips on the ground, burning oil smell, low oil level. Common leak points include valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Clean the affected area to ensure the leak is stopped.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket: $200-$400. Oil pan gasket: $300-$600. Rear main seal: $500-$1000+ (requires transmission removal).
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L DOHC Engine**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.5L, oil leaks are a common issue, particularly from valve cover gaskets and the timing chain cover (if applicable).
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets. The timing chain cover leak is more labor-intensive due to its location.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket: $250-$450. Timing chain cover: $800 - $1500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shift Problems/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting, slipping between gears, rough shifting, or failure to shift at all.
    * Solution: In some cases, a fluid change and filter replacement may help. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change: $100 - $200. Valve body repair/replacement: $500 - $1200. Transmission rebuild: $2000 - $4000+. Transmission replacement: $3000 - $5000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Clutch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clutch slipping, difficulty shifting, clutch pedal sticking or feeling spongy, unusual noises when pressing the clutch pedal.
    * Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing. It's also recommended to resurface the flywheel or replace it if it's excessively worn.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Sagging Rear Suspension**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than the front, especially when loaded. This is often due to worn-out rear struts and springs.
    * Solution: Replace the rear struts and springs. Upgrading to stiffer springs or self-leveling struts (if originally equipped) may improve ride height and load-carrying capacity.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per pair (depending on parts and labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and uneven tire wear can also occur.
    * Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings. In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to replace the entire control arm.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing replacement: $200-$500 per control arm (depending on labor). Control arm replacement: $300-$700 per control arm.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough idling, or stalling. Oxygen sensors degrade over time and need to be replaced.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per sensor (depending on location and type).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard (battery light), difficulty starting the engine, or a dead battery.
    * Solution: Replace the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (depending on new or remanufactured).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust on the quarter panels, rocker panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage is a common issue, especially in areas with road salt.
    * Solution: Repairing rust damage can range from minor patching to extensive panel replacement. Prevention is key with rust inhibitors and regular washing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the extent of the rust. Minor surface rust: $100-$300. Significant rust repair/panel replacement: $500 - $3000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Power Window Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Windows not rolling up or down, slow window operation, or clicking noises from the window motor. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Window motor replacement: $200 - $400. Regulator replacement: $250 - $500. Switch replacement: $50 - $200.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Subaru Outback is generally a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The most significant concerns are head gasket failures (2.5L engine), oil leaks (both engines), rust, and potential transmission issues. While some issues, like oxygen sensor replacement, are relatively inexpensive, others, like head gasket repair or transmission rebuild, can be costly. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify potential problems and negotiate a fair price. Be sure to check if any of the common issues listed are present.
