The 2015 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its reliability, standard all-wheel drive, and spacious interior. Engine options included a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder and a 3.6L six-cylinder. The 2.5L produced 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the Outback's fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.5L), comfortable ride, and cargo capacity. Common complaints revolve around the CVT's performance (some find it sluggish), the infotainment system's responsiveness, and the overall driving experience not being particularly sporty.

**Engine**

**2.5L H4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2015 Outbacks with the 2.5L engine experienced excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, low oil level warning lights illuminating, and potential engine damage if the oil level is consistently too low. This is most prevalent with FB25 engines.
    *   Solution: Subaru issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) regarding oil consumption. The recommended solution typically involves performing an oil consumption test, and if the vehicle exceeds a certain threshold, the short block may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (short block replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
