**Introduction:**

The 2009 Subaru Outback is a midsize crossover SUV known for its ruggedness, versatility, and all-wheel drive capabilities. It came with a choice of two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0-liter six-cylinder with 245 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a five-speed manual, six-speed manual, and five-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Outback's ample cargo space, off-road handling, and safety features but have expressed concerns about some reliability issues.

**Engine**

* **2.5-liter four-cylinder**
    * **Head gasket failure:** Premature failure of the head gasket occurs, leading to coolant and oil leaks. The engine may overheat or lose compression.
        * Solution: Replace the head gasket and resurfaced cylinder heads.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
        * Recalls: None Found
* **3.0-liter six-cylinder**
    * **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt, which synchronizes the operation of the engine's valves and pistons, can fail prematurely, leading to catastrophic engine damage.
        * Solution: Replace the timing belt and related components.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500
        * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **Five-speed automatic:**
    * **Transmission slipping:** The transmission loses power while driving, causing the vehicle to hesitate or lose acceleration.
        * Solution: Replace the transmission or rebuild it.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
        * Recalls: NHTSA Campaign Number: 11V527000
* **Six-speed manual:**
    * **Clutch failure:** The clutch, which engages the transmission to the engine, can wear out prematurely or fail. This results in difficulty shifting gears or a loss of power.
        * Solution: Replace the clutch assembly.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500
        * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2009 Subaru Outback is a reliable vehicle overall, but it has some notable issues that can be costly to repair. Serious issues like head gasket failure and timing belt failure can lead to catastrophic engine damage, while transmission issues and suspension failures can impact driving safety. Electrical issues and interior problems are less severe but can still be annoying and require expensive repairs. Owners should be aware of these potential issues before buying and consider budgeting for maintenance and unexpected repairs.
