The 2002 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon known for its practicality, reliability (generally), and standard all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 2.5L SOHC EJ25 flat-4 engine producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L DOHC EZ30 flat-6 engine producing 212 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L engine came exclusively with the 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Outback's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and off-road capability, while common complaints include head gasket issues on the 2.5L engine and the age-related issues that come with owning a 20+ year old vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2002 Subaru Outback is a generally reliable vehicle, but given its age, common issues include head gasket failure (primarily on the 2.5L engine), oil leaks, rust, and suspension wear. Electrical issues and interior wear and tear are also common. Repair costs can range from relatively minor fixes (e.g., headlight restoration) to more substantial expenses (e.g., head gasket replacement, transmission repair). Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the vehicle's overall condition and identify any potential problems.
