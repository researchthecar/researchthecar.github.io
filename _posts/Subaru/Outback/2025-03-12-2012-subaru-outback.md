The 2012 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its practicality, standard all-wheel drive, and spacious interior. Engine options included a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine was available with either a 6-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 3.6L was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Outback for its off-road capability, reliability, and cargo capacity. Common complaints include the sometimes sluggish performance of the 2.5L engine, especially when fully loaded, and reports of various electrical issues and CVT problems (on models so equipped).

**Summary:**

The 2012 Subaru Outback, while generally reliable, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, which can lead to costly repairs. CVT issues, particularly in the 2.5L models, and electrical problems are also relatively frequent. While the 3.6L engine avoids the oil consumption issues of the 2.5L, it is more expensive and has worse gas mileage. Suspension sag is another common issue, though less critical. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. A thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2012 Outback is highly recommended.
