The 2005 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its reliability and off-road capabilities thanks to its standard all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated 4-cylinder boxer engine producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L H6 DOHC naturally aspirated 6-cylinder boxer engine producing 250 horsepower and 219 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L engine was only available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Outback's practicality, all-weather performance, and comfortable ride. Common complaints include somewhat lackluster fuel economy (especially with the H6 engine), and some specific reliability concerns that have surfaced over time.
