The 2008 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon known for its practicality, standard all-wheel drive, and reliability. Engine options for the 2008 Outback include a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L H6 engine producing 245 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque.
