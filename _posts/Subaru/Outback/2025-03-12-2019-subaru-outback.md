The 2019 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and strong safety ratings. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the Outback for its reliability, practicality, and off-road capabilities. However, some common complaints include the sometimes sluggish acceleration of the 2.5L engine, infotainment system quirks, and wind noise at highway speeds.
