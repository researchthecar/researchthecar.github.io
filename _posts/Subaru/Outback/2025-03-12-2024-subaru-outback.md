The 2024 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and off-road capability. It offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and a reputation for reliability. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Engine options include a 2.5L naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Some common dislikes include the sometimes sluggish response of the base engine, and the infotainment system's learning curve.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil level light illuminating or noticing a significant decrease in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The solution depends on the severity. Initially, monitoring oil consumption and topping off as needed is common. If consumption is excessive, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test to determine if further action is needed. In some cases, piston ring replacement or engine replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly; monitoring has no cost. Testing may be minimal cost and up to $100. Piston ring replacement can be several thousand dollars. Engine replacement can exceed $5000-$8000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**Lineartronic CVT (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience jerky or harsh shifts, especially at low speeds or during acceleration. Hesitation upon acceleration can also be present. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer to recalibrate the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. In more severe cases, a valve body replacement or even complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: Free to $150; Valve body replacement: $800-$1500; Transmission replacement: $4000-$8000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This can affect access to navigation, audio, and climate controls. The screen may also go black or reboot unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer is the most common solution. In some cases, a head unit replacement may be necessary. Performing a hard reset can sometimes temporarily resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: Free to $150; Head Unit Replacement: $500-$1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle sits for an extended period. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: The dealer can perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Potential causes include a faulty module not shutting down properly, accessories left on, or a defective battery. Replacing the battery or addressing the source of the draw is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement: $150-$300; Parasitic draw diagnosis and repair: $100-$500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues can include the sunroof failing to open or close properly, unusual noises during operation, or leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a technician is required to determine the cause. The repair could range from lubricating the tracks to replacing the motor or the entire sunroof assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2024 Subaru Outback experiences a few notable issues. The most concerning may be the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, as this could lead to significant repair costs if not addressed promptly. Infotainment system glitches and battery drain issues are also common, although often resolved with software updates or minor repairs. CVT issues can also be present, which also could result in a costly repair if the issue is determined to be a failure of the transmission assembly. Overall, while the Outback has its issues, they are fairly common for modern vehicles, and can be mitigated with regular maintenance and prompt attention to any unusual symptoms.
