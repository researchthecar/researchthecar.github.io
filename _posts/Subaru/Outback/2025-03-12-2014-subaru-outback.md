The 2014 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon known for its practicality, reliability, and standard all-wheel drive. Two engine options were available: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder. The 2.5-liter produced 173 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5-liter was available with either a 6-speed manual or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission), while the 3.6-liter was paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Outback's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and off-road capability. Common complaints include the somewhat underwhelming performance of the 2.5-liter engine and some reported issues with the CVT transmission, particularly with earlier model years.
