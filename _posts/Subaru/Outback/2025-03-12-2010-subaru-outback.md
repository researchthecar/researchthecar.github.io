The 2010 Subaru Outback marked a significant shift for the model, moving further away from its wagon roots and more towards a crossover SUV. Two engine options were available: a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5L engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), while the 3.6L engine was only available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Outback's versatility, spacious interior, and standard all-wheel drive. Common complaints revolved around the base engine's perceived lack of power, the CVT's behavior, and some reliability concerns.
