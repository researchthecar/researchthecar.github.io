The 2013 Subaru Outback is a popular wagon/SUV known for its practicality, all-wheel-drive capability, and ample cargo space. Available with either a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 173 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque or a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine, the Outback caters to different performance needs. The 2.5i models come standard with a 6-speed manual transmission with the option for a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission), while the 3.6R models are exclusively paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Common praises for the Outback include its reliability and off-road capability, while complaints often center on the CVT's performance and occasional electrical issues.

**Summary**

The 2013 Subaru Outback, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners have reported. The most severe and costly issues involve the CVT transmission (on 2.5L models) and the 2.5L engine's oil consumption problems. Suspension and electrical issues are generally less severe and costly to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have any used Outback thoroughly inspected before purchase, paying particular attention to the transmission and engine health. The 3.6L models are generally considered more reliable due to the lack of CVT and less common oil consumption issues, but potential buyers should still be aware of potential issues.
