### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Subaru Outback is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly praised for its standard AWD system. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, most notably head gasket failures, which can be a significant expense across all engine variants. Oil leaks are also common as the vehicle ages. Transmission issues, while not widespread, can manifest as harsh shifting in automatics or clutch wear in manuals. Suspension components like sway bar links and strut mounts are typical wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure have been reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the blower motor and seat fabric may show wear. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate many of these potential problems.
