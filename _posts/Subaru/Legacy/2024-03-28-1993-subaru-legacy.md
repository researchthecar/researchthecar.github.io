**Introduction**

The 1993 Subaru Legacy is a midsize sedan that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base model came with a 2.2-liter flat-four engine that produced 130 horsepower and 153 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.5-liter flat-four engine that produced 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque was available as an option.
