The 2021 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that generates 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Some owners appreciate the Legacy's spacious interior, standard safety features, and all-weather capability. Common dislikes include the unremarkable styling and the CVT's performance, which can feel sluggish at times.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. The symptoms can include the low oil pressure warning light illuminating or noticing a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and top-offs as needed. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: For minor top-offs, the cost is minimal (cost of oil). Engine repair or replacement can range from $3,000-$7,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.

**Summary**

The 2021 Subaru Legacy has some reported issues, with the most common concerns relating to the transmission, infotainment system, and, in some cases, excessive oil consumption on the 2.5L engine.
