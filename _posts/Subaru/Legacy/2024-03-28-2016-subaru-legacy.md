**Introduction:**

The 2016 Subaru Legacy is a midsize sedan that offers a blend of reliability, performance, and value. It is available with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a CVT or a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The Legacy is praised for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and excellent safety ratings. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues.

**Engine**

- **2.5L Four-Cylinder Engine:**
  - **Fuel Injector Failure:** Leaking or clogged fuel injectors can cause rough idling, loss of power, and increased emissions. Solution: Replace or clean fuel injectors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $400+

- **3.6L Six-Cylinder Engine:**
  - **Intake Valve Carbon Buildup:** Over time, carbon deposits can accumulate on intake valves, causing reduced airflow and engine performance. Solution: Clean or replace intake valves. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600+

**Transmission**

- **CVT:**
  - **Transmission Slipping:** The CVT may experience slipping, shuddering, or hesitation during acceleration. Solution: Replace or repair transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+

**Summary:**

The 2016 Subaru Legacy is a generally reliable vehicle, but it does have some reported issues. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the problem. While some issues, such as dashboard squeaks or condensation in the headlights, are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, like engine or transmission failures, can be more costly and affect the vehicle's performance and durability. It is important for owners to be aware of these potential problems so they can address them promptly if needed.
