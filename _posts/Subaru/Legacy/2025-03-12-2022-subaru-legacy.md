The 2022 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive, comfortable ride, and good fuel economy. Engine options include a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Many owners appreciate the Legacy's practicality, safety features, and all-weather capability. Some common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired styling and the occasionally sluggish performance of the base engine.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating or noticing a decrease in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Subaru has issued technical service bulletins (TSBs) related to oil consumption in some of their engines. Dealers may perform an oil consumption test. If excessive consumption is confirmed, the repair may involve replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the extent of the repair, but replacing piston rings can range from $2,000 - $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Turbocharged Engine**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Lineartronic CVT**

*   **Hesitation or Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced a hesitation or slight jerking sensation, particularly during low-speed acceleration or when transitioning from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software update or CVT recalibration performed by the dealer may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a valve body replacement or complete CVT replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically covered under warranty. Valve body replacement could range from $1,500 - $2,500. Full CVT replacement could exceed $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, controlling navigation, audio, and climate functions, may freeze, become unresponsive, or spontaneously reboot.
    *   Solution: Often, a software update from the dealership will resolve this issue. In some cases, a hardware replacement of the infotainment unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free or covered under warranty. Replacing the infotainment unit can range from $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently or is only used for short trips. Symptoms include difficulty starting the engine or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Possible causes include a faulty battery, parasitic drain from an electrical component, or a malfunctioning alternator. Replacement or repair of the affected component is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement can range from $150 - $300. Alternator replacement could range from $400 - $800. Diagnosing and repairing a parasitic drain can vary widely, from $100-$500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattling/Wind Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises or excessive wind noise emanating from the sunroof area, especially at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: The dealer may need to adjust the sunroof mechanism, replace weather stripping, or apply lubricant to reduce friction.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Adjustment or lubrication may be covered under warranty or cost less than $100. Replacing weather stripping could range from $100 - $300.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Subaru Legacy generally experiences relatively few major issues. The most commonly reported problems revolve around the infotainment system, potential excessive oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, and some CVT transmission concerns with the Lineartronic CVT transmission. While some of these issues can be addressed with software updates or minor repairs, others, like replacing piston rings or the CVT, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure the vehicle has been properly maintained and inspected before purchase.
