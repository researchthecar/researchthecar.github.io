The 2018 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive, comfortable ride, and reputation for reliability. Engine options include a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter naturally aspirated six-cylinder engine that produces 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the Legacy's all-weather capability and spacious interior, but some criticize its somewhat bland styling and occasionally sluggish acceleration with the base engine.
