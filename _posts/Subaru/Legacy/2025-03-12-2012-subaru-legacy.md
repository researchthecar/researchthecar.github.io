The 2012 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive, a feature that sets it apart from many competitors in its class. Engine options for the 2012 Legacy include a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine, producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine. The 2.5-liter engine could be paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 3.6-liter engine was only available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Legacy for its reliability, safety features, and all-weather capability. Common complaints include the somewhat uninspired styling and the lack of some advanced tech features compared to rivals.
