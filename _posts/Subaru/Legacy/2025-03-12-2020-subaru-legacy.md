The 2020 Subaru Legacy marked the start of the seventh generation of this mid-size sedan. It was available with two engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) with paddle shifters and an 8-speed manual mode. Many owners praised the Legacy for its standard all-wheel drive, comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints included the somewhat bland styling and the occasionally sluggish performance of the base engine.

**Summary**

The 2020 Subaru Legacy, while generally a reliable vehicle, has some reported issues. The most concerning is the potential for CVT failure, which can be costly to repair. Excessive oil consumption in the base engine is another area to monitor. Electrical issues, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also relatively common. While some issues are minor annoyances (rattles), others can significantly impact the driving experience and reliability of the vehicle. The average repair cost for the identified issues ranges from relatively inexpensive fixes to potentially significant expenses, particularly if CVT replacement or major engine work is required.
