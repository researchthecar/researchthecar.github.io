## 2015 Subaru Legacy

The 2015 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan that offers a combination of practicality, safety, and all-wheel drive capability. It comes with a choice of two engines: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Legacy received high praise for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and excellent safety ratings. However, it has also been plagued by several issues that have affected owners' satisfaction.

### Engine

**2.5-liter Four-Cylinder**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption:** Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups. Symptoms include low oil levels, blue smoke from the exhaust, and decreased engine performance. This issue can be caused by worn piston rings or valve guides. The solution involves replacing the affected parts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
* **Timing Chain Noise:** A rattling or ticking noise coming from the engine may indicate a stretched or worn timing chain. This can lead to decreased engine power and performance. The solution is to replace the timing chain and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Head Gasket Failure:** A blown head gasket can cause coolant and oil to mix, leading to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include a milky substance in the oil, white smoke from the exhaust, and a loss of coolant. The solution involves replacing the head gasket and associated parts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+

**3.6-liter Six-Cylinder**

* **Piston Ring Failure:** Some owners have experienced piston ring failure, resulting in excessive oil consumption and decreased engine performance. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, low oil levels, and engine knock. The solution involves rebuilding or replacing the engine. Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+

### Transmission

**CVT**

* **Hesitation and Jerking:** Some owners have reported hesitation, jerking, or shuddering during acceleration or shifting. This can be caused by worn or damaged CVT components. The solution involves replacing the affected parts or reprogramming the transmission control module. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
* **Transmission Failure:** In severe cases, the CVT can fail completely, resulting in a loss of power and drivability. Symptoms include a noisy transmission, slipping gears, and a lack of response to input. The solution involves replacing the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+

### Suspension

* **Strut Failure:** Worn or damaged struts can lead to a loss of stability and handling, as well as an uncomfortable ride. Symptoms include excessive body roll, poor cornering, and a vibrating or shaking sensation. The solution involves replacing the affected struts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per strut
* **Rear Sway Bar Links:** Worn or snapped rear sway bar links can affect the vehicle's stability and handling. Symptoms include excessive body roll and a loose or rattling rear end. The solution involves replacing the affected sway bar links. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per link

### Electrical

* **Electrical Shorts:** Some owners have reported electrical shorts causing various issues, such as battery drain, blown fuses, and flickering lights. The solution involves identifying and repairing the affected electrical components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

### Exterior

* **Door Handle Recall:** The Subaru Legacy was subject to a recall (NHTSA Campaign Number 15V563000) due to faulty door handles that could break off, posing a safety hazard. The recall involved replacing the affected door handles free of charge.
* **Windshield Stress Cracks:** Some owners have experienced stress cracks developing on the windshield, even in the absence of any impact. The solution involves replacing the windshield. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

### Interior

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Some owners have reported issues with the climate control system, such as inoperative buttons or erratic temperature regulation. The solution involves repairing or replacing the affected climate control components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Seatback Latch Failure:** A failed seatback latch can prevent the seat from reclining or remaining in the upright position. The solution involves replacing the affected latch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
* **Sunroof Drain Plugs:** Clogged or damaged sunroof drain plugs can cause water to accumulate and leak into the interior. The solution involves cleaning or replacing the affected drain plugs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

### Summary

The 2015 Subaru Legacy has faced a range of issues affecting the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and interior. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be severe and costly. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and take appropriate precautions, such as regular maintenance and repairs, to minimize the risk of experiencing them.
