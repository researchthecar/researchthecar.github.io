**Introduction:**

The 2020 Subaru Legacy is a midsize sedan offered with a choice of two engines: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, or a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder generating 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Legacy is praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and advanced safety features. However, it has also been criticized for its lackluster acceleration and uninspiring handling.
