The 2005 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan/wagon known for its standard all-wheel drive, which is one of its major selling points. The 2005 model year came with three engine options: a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated flat-4 producing 168 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L SOHC turbocharged flat-4 producing 250 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque (Legacy GT), and a 3.0L DOHC naturally aspirated flat-6 producing 250 horsepower and 219 lb-ft of torque (Legacy 3.0R). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic (2.5i), and a 5-speed automatic (Legacy GT and 3.0R). People appreciate the Legacy for its reliability, all-weather capability, and comfortable ride. Common complaints include its somewhat bland styling and potential for high maintenance costs, particularly with the turbocharged engine.
