**Introduction:**
The 1996 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The standard engine was a 2.2-liter flat-four that produced 135 horsepower and 153 lb-ft of torque. A 2.5-liter flat-four was also available, producing 155 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The Legacy was praised for its spacious interior, all-wheel drive capability, and decent fuel economy, but it was criticized for its lackluster performance and outdated design.

**Summary:**
The 1996 Subaru Legacy is a reliable vehicle overall, but it is not without its issues. The most severe and expensive problem is head gasket failure, which can occur in both the 2.2-liter and 2.5-liter engines. Other common issues include intake valve sticking, transmission slippage, and alternator failure. While some of these issues can be costly to repair, many of them are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix.
