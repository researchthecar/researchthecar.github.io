The 2009 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel-drive, a feature that sets it apart from many competitors. Engine options included a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder, producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 256 horsepower and 257 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L six-cylinder engine producing 245 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic (with the 2.5L non-turbo), and a 5-speed automatic (with the 2.5L turbo and 3.0L six-cylinder). Owners often appreciate the Legacy's practicality, all-weather capability, and comfortable ride. Some common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the turbo engine), the somewhat bland interior, and potential maintenance costs associated with the all-wheel-drive system.

**Summary**

The 2009 Subaru Legacy can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine, particularly head gasket issues in the naturally aspirated 2.5L engine and turbocharger problems in the turbocharged 2.5L engine. Other potential problems include oil leaks, suspension issues, and electrical problems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but addressing them promptly can help prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's reliability. The head gasket issue and turbocharger failures can be quite expensive repairs, while other issues like oxygen sensor failures and wheel bearing replacements are generally more manageable. A thorough pre-purchase inspection is recommended.
