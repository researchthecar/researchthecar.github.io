**Introduction**
The 1998 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliable performance. It is powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 150 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options include a 2.2-liter four-cylinder and a 3.0-liter six-cylinder. The Legacy is known for its excellent handling and all-wheel drive capability, but it has some common issues that potential owners should be aware of before buying.

**Engine**

**2.5-liter Four-Cylinder**
* **Head gasket failure:** A blown head gasket can cause coolant leaks, overheating, and engine damage. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and decreased engine power. The repair involves replacing the head gasket and resurfacing the cylinder head. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500
* **Valve cover gasket leak:** A leaking valve cover gasket can cause oil leaks and reduced engine performance. Symptoms include oil stains on the engine around the valve cover and a burning oil smell. The repair involves replacing the valve cover gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400
* **Timing belt failure:** A timing belt that fails can cause significant engine damage. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, engine misfiring, and decreased engine power. The repair involves replacing the timing belt and related components. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000
* **Intake manifold gasket leak:** A leaking intake manifold gasket can cause vacuum leaks, rough idling, and decreased engine performance. Symptoms include a hissing sound from the engine, increased fuel consumption, and engine check light illumination. The repair involves replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $600
* **Fuel injector failure:** A faulty fuel injector can cause engine misfiring, rough idling, and decreased engine performance. Symptoms include difficulty starting the engine, hesitation during acceleration, and increased fuel consumption. The repair involves replacing the fuel injector. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400 per injector

**2.2-liter Four-Cylinder**
* **No Issues Found**

**3.0-liter Six-Cylinder**
* **Head gasket failure:** Symptoms and repair are the same as the 2.5-liter engine. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,000

**Transmission**

**Four-Speed Automatic**
* **Transmission slip:** A slipping transmission can cause delayed shifting, hesitation during acceleration, and decreased fuel economy. Symptoms may worsen over time. The repair involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $2,500 - $4,000
* **Transmission shift solenoid failure:** A faulty shift solenoid can cause shifting problems, including delayed shifting, harsh shifts, or the transmission getting stuck in one gear. Symptoms may vary depending on the solenoid that fails. The repair involves replacing the shift solenoid or rebuilding the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,500

**Suspension**

* **Strut mount bearing failure:** A worn strut mount bearing can cause knocking or clunking noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps or turning. Symptoms may also include vibration in the steering wheel. The repair involves replacing the strut mount bearing. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400 per strut
* **Sway bar link failure:** A broken sway bar link can cause rattling or clunking noises from the suspension, especially over bumps. Symptoms may also include reduced stability during cornering. The repair involves replacing the sway bar link. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200 per link

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** A failing alternator can cause electrical problems such as flickering headlights, dim interior lights, and reduced battery power. Symptoms may also include difficulty starting the engine. The repair involves replacing the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000
* **Starter failure:** A faulty starter can cause difficulty starting the engine, especially in cold weather. Symptoms may include a clicking or grinding noise when turning the key. The repair involves replacing the starter. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $600
* **Battery drain:** A parasitic battery drain can cause the battery to discharge prematurely, especially after the car has been parked for an extended period. Symptoms may include difficulty starting the engine, dim interior lights, and a dead battery. The repair involves identifying and fixing the source of the parasitic drain. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $500

**Exterior**

* **Rear spoiler failure:** The rear spoiler on the Legacy can be prone to cracking or breaking, especially at the attachment points. Symptoms include visible damage to the spoiler. The repair involves replacing the spoiler. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400
* **Sunroof leak:** A leaking sunroof can cause water damage to the interior of the car. Symptoms may include water stains on the headliner, dashboard, or floor mats. The repair involves identifying and sealing the source of the leak. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000

**Interior**

* **Dashboard rattle:** A rattling dashboard can be caused by loose components or a defective sound insulation. Symptoms may include a distracting noise while driving over bumps or rough roads. The repair involves identifying and securing the loose components or replacing the sound insulation. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $300
* **Climate control failure:** A malfunctioning climate control system can cause problems with heating, cooling, or ventilation. Symptoms may include difficulty adjusting the temperature or fan speed, or a lack of air flow. The repair involves diagnosing and repairing the faulty component, such as the climate control module, blower motor, or refrigerant compressor. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $1,000

**Recalls**

* NHTSA Campaign ID: 98V151000: Headlight Failure
* NHTSA Campaign ID: 98V196000: Fuel Injector Failure

**Summary**

The 1998 Subaru Legacy is a reliable and versatile vehicle, but it has some common issues that potential owners should be aware of. The most severe issue is head gasket failure, which can lead to catastrophic engine damage if not repaired promptly. Other common problems include valve cover gasket leaks, transmission slip, and electrical issues. While most of the issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, some, such as major engine or transmission repairs, can be quite costly. Overall, the Legacy is a solid choice for those seeking a comfortable and practical sedan, but buyers should factor in the potential cost of repairs before purchasing.
