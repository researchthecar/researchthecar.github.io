The 2024 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive and reputation for safety and reliability. It offers a comfortable ride and ample interior space. Available engine options include a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that generates 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Common criticisms of the Legacy often involve the somewhat uninspiring driving dynamics and the reliance on the CVT transmission, which some drivers find less engaging than a traditional automatic. On the other hand, owners appreciate the standard AWD, comfortable interior, and comprehensive suite of safety features.
