## 2000 Subaru Legacy

The 2000 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.2-liter four-cylinder that produced 142 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. A 2.5-liter four-cylinder was also available, producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive was standard on all models.

The Legacy was praised for its roomy interior, comfortable ride, and standard all-wheel drive. However, some drivers complained about the car's lackluster performance and high fuel consumption.
