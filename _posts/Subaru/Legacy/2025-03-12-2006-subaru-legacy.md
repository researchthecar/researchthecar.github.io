The 2006 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan and wagon known for its standard all-wheel drive, comfortable ride, and practical nature. Engine options included a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 169 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L SOHC turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L DOHC six-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 219 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual transmission and a 4-speed automatic transmission (for the non-turbo 2.5L) and a 5-speed automatic transmission (for the turbo 2.5L and the 3.0L). Owners generally appreciate the Legacy's all-weather capability and reliability. Some dislike the somewhat bland styling and fuel economy compared to some competitors.
