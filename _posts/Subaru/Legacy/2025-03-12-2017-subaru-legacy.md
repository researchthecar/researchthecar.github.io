The 2017 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive, a desirable feature in regions with inclement weather. The Legacy came with two engine options: a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). People generally liked the Legacy for its AWD capability, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common dislikes include the somewhat underwhelming base engine performance and the drone sometimes associated with CVT transmissions.
