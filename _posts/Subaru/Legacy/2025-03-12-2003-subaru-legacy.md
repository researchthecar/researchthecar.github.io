The 2003 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan and wagon known for its standard all-wheel drive and reliability. Engine options included a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 280 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque (primarily in the GT models, not available in all markets). Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Legacy's all-weather capability and durability, but some dislike its somewhat bland styling and fuel economy.

Turbocharger issues and boost leaks are the main problems with the 2.0L turbo engine. Suspension wear and electrical problems like window regulator failure are also common. Rust can be a major problem. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
