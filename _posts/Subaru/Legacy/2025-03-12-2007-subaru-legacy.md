**Summary**

The 2007 Subaru Legacy, while generally reliable, has a few common problem areas. Head gasket failures on the 2.5L naturally aspirated engine and oil leaks on the 2.5L turbocharged and H6 engines are significant concerns, potentially leading to high repair bills. Suspension issues, particularly with wheel bearings and strut components, can also arise. Electrical problems, such as battery drain, can be frustrating. Rust, especially in regions with harsh winters, is another factor to consider. Overall, while the Legacy offers the benefits of all-wheel drive and a comfortable ride, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. Repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes to costly engine or transmission overhauls.
