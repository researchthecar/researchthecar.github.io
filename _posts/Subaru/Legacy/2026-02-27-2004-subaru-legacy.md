### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Subaru Legacy is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues, particularly head gasket failures on both naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, and wear on suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also noted. Electrical problems such as alternator failure and window regulator issues can arise. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior HVAC blower motor failures are also points to consider. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Legacys have proven durable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
