The 2010 Subaru Legacy marked the beginning of the fifth generation of this mid-size sedan. It was available with three engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder (170 hp, 170 lb-ft of torque), a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (265 hp, 258 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder (256 hp, 247 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 6-speed manual (2.5L only), a 5-speed automatic (2.5L and 3.6L), and a CVT (2.5L only). Owners generally appreciate the Legacy's standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include the base engine's perceived lack of power and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2010 Subaru Legacy has some notable problem areas. The 2.5L engine can suffer from excessive oil consumption, and the CVT transmission has been known to have valve body failures. Turbocharger issues can affect the 2.5L turbo engine. Other issues, such as oxygen sensor failures and wheel bearing problems, can occur across the models. Rust is also a potential concern, especially in regions with heavy road salt usage. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. The severity of these issues varies, but addressing them promptly is crucial for maintaining the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
