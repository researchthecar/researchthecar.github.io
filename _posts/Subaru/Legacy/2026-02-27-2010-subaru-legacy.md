### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Subaru Legacy is a generally dependable vehicle, with its all-wheel-drive system being a significant draw. The most commonly cited significant mechanical concern is head gasket failure, particularly on the naturally aspirated 2.5L engine, though this was less prevalent than in earlier generations. Turbocharged models can experience issues related to the turbocharger and piston rings. Automatic transmission torque converters can also be a point of concern. Electrical components like power window motors and alternators are not immune to failure. However, for many owners, these issues are infrequent, and the Legacy remains a solid choice for those seeking all-weather capability and a comfortable ride, provided regular maintenance is performed.
