The 2019 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Engine options include a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Legacy's reliability, safety features, and fuel efficiency (particularly with the 2.5L engine). Common complaints include the somewhat uninspired styling and the CVT transmission's occasional sluggishness and droning noise, as well as the infotainment system.

**Summary**

The 2019 Subaru Legacy generally offers decent reliability but it's worth noting the potential issues related to oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, the CVT transmission, and the infotainment system. The cost of repairs can range from relatively minor software updates to more significant expenses like CVT replacement or engine work. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection, especially focusing on the CVT's performance and any signs of oil consumption.
