# 2015 Subaru Legacy

### Overview
The 2015 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel-drive system and comfortable ride. It offers a choice between two horizontally opposed boxer engines: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder and a more powerful 3.6-liter six-cylinder. Both are paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Reliability for the 2015 model year is generally considered good, with owners reporting satisfaction with its performance and longevity. However, like any vehicle, there are specific areas that have seen more attention from mechanics and owners, particularly concerning the CVT and certain engine components. This analysis focuses on documented technical issues beyond routine maintenance.
