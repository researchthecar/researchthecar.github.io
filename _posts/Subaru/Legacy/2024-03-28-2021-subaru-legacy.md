**Introduction:**

The 2021 Subaru Legacy is a midsize sedan known for its spacious interior, standard all-wheel drive, and strong safety features. It offers two engine options: a 182-horsepower 2.5-liter naturally aspirated flat-four and a 260-horsepower 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four. Both engines come standard with a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

While the Legacy is appreciated for its reliability and value, it has received some criticism for its uninspired interior and lack of a hybrid option.
