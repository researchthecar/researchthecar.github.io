The 2014 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive, a feature that sets it apart from many of its competitors. Engine options for the 2014 Legacy include a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 173 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine rated at 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. The 2.5-liter engine could be paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 3.6-liter engine was exclusively paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Legacy for its reliability, all-weather capability, and comfortable ride. Common complaints include the somewhat bland interior styling and the CVT transmission's performance in the 2.5L model.
