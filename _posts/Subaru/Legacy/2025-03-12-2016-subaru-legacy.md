The 2016 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior. Engine options included a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the car's comfortable ride, safety features, and all-weather capability, but some dislike the somewhat uninspired styling and the CVT's performance.

**Engine**

**2.5L Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2016 Subaru Legacy owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating, the need to add oil frequently, and blue-ish exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Some dealerships perform an oil consumption test to verify the issue. Depending on the severity, potential solutions include replacing the piston rings, valve seals, or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+ depending on the repair.

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car may throw a code indicating the catalytic converter is not operating properly, causing a check engine light. Performance can also suffer.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

**3.6L Six-Cylinder**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**Lineartronic CVT**

*   **CVT Juddering/Shaking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing juddering, shaking, or hesitation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT may require replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $5,000+ (CVT replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a day or two, especially if the car is not driven regularly.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the parasitic drain. This could involve testing individual components to see which one is drawing power when the car is off. Common culprits include the infotainment system, alarm system, or a faulty module. Replacement of battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$500+ depending on the root cause.

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, lag, or fail to respond to inputs. Issues may include Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation glitches, and unresponsive touch screen.
    *   Solution: Try a software update. If that doesn't work, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on software troubleshooting or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

**Summary**

The 2016 Subaru Legacy has some common issues, with engine-related problems (particularly oil consumption in the 2.5L engine) and CVT transmission concerns being the most significant. Electrical issues with the battery and infotainment system are also present, and some owners report exterior and interior issues like windshield and dashboard cracking. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly, but addressing the engine and transmission issues can be particularly expensive.
