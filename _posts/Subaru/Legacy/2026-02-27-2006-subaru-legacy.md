### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Subaru Legacy is a generally dependable vehicle, especially for those seeking all-wheel-drive capability. The most significant recurring issues tend to be head gasket failures, particularly on the 2.5L engines, and oil consumption. Turbocharged models (GT) can also experience turbocharger issues. Automatic transmissions, especially the older 4-speed, may develop shifting problems. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the Legacy to be a robust and enjoyable car when properly maintained. Addressing potential head gasket issues proactively can significantly enhance long-term reliability.
