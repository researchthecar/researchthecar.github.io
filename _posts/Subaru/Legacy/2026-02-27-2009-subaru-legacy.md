### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Subaru Legacy presents a generally solid reliability record, especially with its robust all-wheel-drive system. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly the head gasket failures prevalent in the 2.5L naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines, and oil consumption concerns. The 5-speed automatic transmission is generally more reliable than the older 4-speed automatic. Electrical issues like window regulators and alternators can also arise. While the 3.0L engine and manual transmissions are less prone to major mechanical failures, routine maintenance and inspection of these known weak points are crucial for long-term ownership satisfaction.
