### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Subaru Legacy generally offers good reliability, particularly with its robust all-wheel-drive system. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the engine, specifically head gasket leaks and oil consumption on the naturally aspirated models, and turbocharger issues on the turbocharged variant. The CVT transmission can sometimes exhibit hesitation or shuddering. Suspension components like sway bar links and strut mounts may require attention over time. Electrical issues are less common but can include infotainment glitches or battery drain. Exterior and interior issues are typically minor, such as headlight condensation or HVAC blower motor problems. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble can significantly extend the lifespan and reliability of the 2014 Legacy.
