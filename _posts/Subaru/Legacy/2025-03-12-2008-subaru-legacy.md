The 2008 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 243 horsepower and 241 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (for the non-turbo) or a 5-speed automatic (for the turbo). Owners often appreciate the car's all-weather capability and reliability, while some dislike the relatively bland styling and fuel economy compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2008 Subaru Legacy can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine-related problems, particularly head gasket failures in the naturally aspirated engine and turbocharger issues in the turbocharged engine, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, while less common, also represent a significant expense. Suspension and electrical problems are generally less expensive to address. Rust, especially in areas with road salt, can also be a concern. Overall, pre-purchase inspection focusing on these areas is highly recommended.
