### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Subaru Legacy is a capable vehicle, particularly praised for its all-wheel-drive system. However, potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues, most notably head gasket failures, which are prevalent on both naturally aspirated and turbocharged EJ25 engines. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, and wear on suspension components are also points to consider. Electrical gremlins like instrument cluster problems and window regulators can occur. Rust is a concern for vehicles in certain climates. Despite these potential drawbacks, addressing these issues can lead to a reliable vehicle, especially if well-maintained.
