**2004 Subaru Legacy**

The 2004 Subaru Legacy is a midsize sedan that was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that produced 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. A 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine was also available, producing 220 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.

The Legacy was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and standard all-wheel drive. However, some owners have reported issues with the vehicle's engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and interior.

**Engine**

**2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder**

* **Head gasket failure:** Blown head gaskets can cause coolant to leak into the engine oil, leading to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, low coolant levels, and an oily residue on the spark plugs. The fix involves replacing the head gaskets. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the movement of the crankshaft and camshaft. If the timing belt breaks, the engine can be severely damaged. Symptoms include a sudden loss of power and a loud banging noise. The fix involves replacing the timing belt and any damaged components. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+

**3.0-Liter Six-Cylinder**

* **Valve spring breakage:** Broken valve springs can cause the valves to stick open, leading to engine damage. Symptoms include a rough idle, misfiring, and reduced power. The fix involves replacing the broken valve springs. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+
* **Oil leaks:** Oil leaks can occur from various parts of the engine, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle and low oil levels. The fix involves replacing the leaking gaskets. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+

**Transmission**

**Five-Speed Manual**

* **Shift linkage problems:** The shift linkage can become loose or damaged, making it difficult to shift gears. Symptoms include a loose or sloppy shifter and difficulty shifting into specific gears. The fix involves tightening or replacing the shift linkage. Estimated cost: $100 - $300+
* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out over time, leading to difficulty engaging or disengaging the gears. Symptoms include slipping gears, difficulty shifting, and a burning smell. The fix involves replacing the clutch. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+

**Four-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip or hesitate when shifting gears. Symptoms include delayed or erratic gear changes and loss of power. The fix involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, leading to loss of power and transmission problems. Symptoms include shuddering or vibration during acceleration, difficulty shifting, and a lack of response from the transmission. The fix involves replacing the torque converter. Estimated cost: $800 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

* **Strut mount failure:** The strut mounts can wear out over time, leading to noise and vibration during driving. Symptoms include a clunking noise when hitting bumps, vibrations in the steering wheel, and uneven tire wear. The fix involves replacing the strut mounts. Estimated cost: $300 - $500+
* **Sway bar link failure:** The sway bar links can become loose or damaged, causing noise and instability during cornering. Symptoms include clunking or rattling noises when driving over bumps, increased body roll during cornering, and uneven tire wear. The fix involves replacing the sway bar links. Estimated cost: $100 - $200+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, leading to a loss of electrical power. Symptoms include dim headlights, flickering dashboard lights, and a dead battery. The fix involves replacing the alternator. Estimated cost: $400 - $600+
* **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, preventing the engine from starting. Symptoms include a clicking noise when turning the key and a lack of engine response. The fix involves replacing the starter. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+
