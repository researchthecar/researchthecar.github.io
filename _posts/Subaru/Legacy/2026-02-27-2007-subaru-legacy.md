# 2007 Subaru Legacy

### Overview
The 2007 Subaru Legacy, known for its Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system and boxer engines, generally offers a solid ownership experience. While many owners report high satisfaction and good long-term reliability, like any vehicle, it has specific areas that have seen more attention from mechanics and owners. This analysis focuses on documented common issues beyond routine maintenance, providing insights into potential concerns for the 2.5L naturally aspirated and 2.5L turbocharged engines, as well as the 5-speed manual and 5-speed automatic transmissions. Understanding these potential weak points can help prospective buyers and current owners make informed decisions regarding maintenance and repairs.

## Engine

### 2.5L Naturally Aspirated (EJ253)
**Head Gasket Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Coolant leaks, white smoke from exhaust, overheating, milky oil.
- **Solution:** Replacement of head gaskets and often associated components like head bolts.
- **Cost:** $1200 - $2500

**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Low oil level between changes, blue smoke on startup.
- **Solution:** Can range from PCV valve replacement to piston ring replacement or engine rebuild.
- **Cost:** $300 - $3000+


### 2.5L Turbocharged (EJ255)
**Head Gasket Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Similar to naturally aspirated, but can be exacerbated by higher boost pressures.
- **Solution:** Replacement of head gaskets and associated components.
- **Cost:** $1300 - $2600

**Turbocharger Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of power, whistling noises, excessive smoke, oil leaks around turbo.
- **Solution:** Turbocharger replacement or rebuild.
- **Cost:** $1000 - $2500

**Cracked Exhaust Manifold**
- **Symptoms:** Exhaust leak noise (ticking or puffing sound), especially on cold start.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the exhaust manifold.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Manual Transmission
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Clutch kit replacement (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $700 - $1200

**Input Shaft Bearing Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Grinding noise, especially when clutch is engaged or disengaged.
- **Solution:** Transmission disassembly and bearing replacement.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500


### 5-Speed Automatic Transmission
**Torque Converter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering, slipping, delayed engagement, fluid leaks.
- **Solution:** Torque converter replacement or transmission overhaul.
- **Cost:** $1000 - $2000

**Solenoid Malfunction**
- **Symptoms:** Harsh shifting, transmission fault codes, inability to shift gears.
- **Solution:** Replacement of transmission solenoids.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Sway Bar Links/Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking or rattling noises over bumps, especially at lower speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of sway bar links and/or bushings.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300

**Front Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Vague steering, clunking over bumps, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of control arm bushings or entire control arm assembly.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows, locks, or interior lights malfunctioning intermittently.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


### Alternator
**Premature Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Battery warning light, dimming lights, starting issues.

- **Cost:** $300 - $1000+


### Headlight Condensation
**Moisture Inside Headlights**
- **Symptoms:** Fogging or water droplets visible inside headlight assemblies.
- **Solution:** Sealing headlight assembly or replacement.
- **Cost:** $200 - $600


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Fan only works on highest setting, or not at all.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
- **Cost:** $100 - $250


### Seat Fabric Wear
**Wear on Driver's Seat Bolster**

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Subaru Legacy is a capable vehicle with a generally good reputation for reliability, especially its AWD system. However, potential buyers and owners should be aware of common issues such as head gasket failures (particularly on the 2.5L engines), oil consumption, and potential turbocharger issues on the turbocharged models. Transmission reliability is decent, but clutch wear on manuals and torque converter/solenoid issues on automatics can occur. Suspension components like sway bar links and control arm bushings are also known wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM, and rust on exterior panels are other points to consider. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can significantly mitigate these potential problems and ensure a longer service life for the vehicle.
