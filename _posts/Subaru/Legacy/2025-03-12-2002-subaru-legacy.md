**Summary**

The 2002 Subaru Legacy, while generally reliable, has its share of common issues. Engine-related problems, such as head gasket failures (especially on the 2.5L engine) and oil leaks (especially on the 3.0L), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues are less frequent but can also be expensive. Rust is another concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase.
