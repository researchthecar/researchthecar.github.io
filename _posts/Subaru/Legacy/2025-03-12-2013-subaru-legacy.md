The 2013 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive and reliability. Engine options included a 2.5-liter horizontally-opposed (boxer) four-cylinder engine producing 173 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter horizontally-opposed six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual (only available with the 2.5L) or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Legacy's all-weather capability, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common dislikes include the somewhat uninspired styling, occasionally sluggish acceleration with the 2.5L engine, and the droning sound of the CVT.

**Engine**

**2.5L H4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The engine may burn more oil than Subaru's stated acceptable limit.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Subaru extended the warranty on the affected engines and performed short block replacements to resolve the issue. For those outside of any warranty, options include replacing the piston rings or replacing the short block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature catalytic converter failure, leading to a check engine light and potential emissions test failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L H6**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Lineartronic)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported complete CVT failure at relatively low mileages. Symptoms include slipping, shuddering, and inability to accelerate.
    *   Solution: Complete CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration or jerking motions, especially at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported improvement with a CVT fluid change. In other cases, the valve body or entire CVT unit needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise from the rear of the vehicle, especially noticeable at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected wheel bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Creaking or popping noises from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replacing the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or the battery draining overnight.
    *   Solution: Identify the parasitic draw causing the battery drain. This may involve testing various circuits and components. Replacing the battery is often necessary as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the parasitic drain diagnosis
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the rear wheel arches, particularly in areas with harsh winter climates or road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair and repainting. The extent of the rust will determine the repair cost.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per wheel arch, depending on severity

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Subaru Legacy, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. The 2.5L engine is prone to excessive oil consumption, which can be a costly repair. The CVT transmission is the biggest concern, with some owners experiencing complete failures. Suspension components like wheel bearings and strut mounts can also wear out prematurely. The dashboard cracking and rear wheel arch rust are cosmetic issues but can detract from the vehicle's appearance. Severity ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures. Costs can vary widely, but CVT replacements or engine repairs can be quite expensive.
