The 2015 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine (3.6R) producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Legacy's safety features, fuel efficiency (with the 2.5L), and all-weather capability. Common complaints include lackluster acceleration with the 2.5L engine, a somewhat uninspiring interior, and occasional CVT-related issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may manifest as low oil level warnings or visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Regularly monitor oil levels and consider using a heavier weight oil. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (for oil top-offs) to $3,000+ (for engine repairs/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Six-Cylinder Engine**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting or jerking, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. The CVT can sometimes feel hesitant or produce unusual noises.
    *   Solution: A software update of the transmission control module (TCM) may address this issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (software update) to $3,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete CVT failure can occur. Symptoms include loss of power, inability to shift, and loud whining or grinding noises.
    *   Solution: CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Wheel Bearings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A humming or growling noise emanating from the rear of the vehicle, especially noticeable at higher speeds. Can also be felt as a vibration through the floorboards or steering wheel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected rear wheel bearing(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700 per wheel bearing
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for a few days. This can result in difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Common causes include a parasitic draw from an aftermarket accessory or a faulty battery. If the battery is the issue, replace it with a new one. If a parasitic draw is found, identify and repair the source.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (battery replacement) to $100 - $500+ (diagnosing and repairing parasitic draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes intermittently.
    *   Solution: Perform a system reset. Check for available software updates. If the problem persists, the head unit may need replacement.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Subaru Legacy, while generally reliable, can be prone to certain issues. The CVT transmission is a potential area of concern, and owners should be aware of potential oil consumption issues with the 2.5L engine. Electrical and suspension problems, while less common, can also arise. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, with transmission replacements being the most expensive potential repair. It's important to get a pre-purchase inspection done before buying a used 2015 Legacy, paying special attention to the transmission and engine health.
