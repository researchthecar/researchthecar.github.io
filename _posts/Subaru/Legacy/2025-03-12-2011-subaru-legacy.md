The 2011 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan offering practicality and Subaru's signature symmetrical all-wheel drive. Engine options include a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual (available only with the 2.5L engine) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for both engines. Owners often praise the Legacy for its all-weather capability, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. Common complaints include underwhelming fuel economy with the 3.6L engine, a somewhat bland driving experience, and some reported issues with the CVT transmission.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, blue exhaust smoke, or the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The problem may be caused by faulty piston rings. A compression test can help diagnose the issue. Repair options range from replacing the piston rings to replacing the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Six-Cylinder**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Software update from Subaru, replacement of valve body, or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension sagging, especially when the vehicle is loaded or after several years of use, leading to reduced ground clearance and a bouncy ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear struts and springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially in colder climates, causing difficulty starting the vehicle or requiring frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing faulty components such as the alternator, or parasitic draws from the battery
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **TPMS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensor failure, resulting in a warning light on the dashboard despite proper tire pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty TPMS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the rear wheel wells, especially in areas with heavy salt use during winter.
    *   Solution: Sanding down the rust, applying rust inhibitor, and repainting the affected areas. More extensive rust may require panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sun visors becoming loose and sagging, making it difficult to keep them in the upright position.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 per visor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Subaru Legacy has some common issues, with the most significant ones relating to potential oil consumption in the 2.5L engine and CVT issues in models equipped with that transmission. Suspension sag and electrical problems are also notable. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, engine or transmission work can be costly, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2011 Legacy.
