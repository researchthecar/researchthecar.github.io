The 2023 Subaru Legacy is a mid-size sedan known for its standard all-wheel drive and comfortable ride. The base engine is a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque. An optional engine is a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the Legacy's spacious interior, safety features, and standard all-wheel drive. Criticisms often focus on the CVT's sometimes sluggish response, and the relatively uninspired styling.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Engine**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Dealership inspection to determine the extent of the oil consumption. In some cases, Subaru has performed oil consumption tests and, if consumption exceeds a specified threshold, may replace the engine short block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly; could range from $0 (under warranty) to $3,000+ for an out-of-warranty short block replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Turbocharged Engine**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**CVT (Both Engine Options)**
*   **Hesitation/Jerky Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or a jerky feeling during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This is a common characteristic of CVTs, but some find it more pronounced in the Legacy.
    *   Solution: Software updates may improve the CVT's behavior, but this is often a characteristic of the transmission design. In rare cases, a full transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates; $5,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or unexpectedly reboot while driving. This affects navigation, audio, and other connected services.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset, applying software updates (if available), or replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for system reset/software updates; $500 - $1500+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery may drain prematurely, especially if the car is not driven frequently. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine or complete battery failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery with a higher-capacity version or ensuring all electrical accessories are turned off when the vehicle is not in use. Diagnostic testing to identify parasitic draws on the electrical system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for battery replacement; $100+ for diagnostic testing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or squeaking noises coming from the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck.
    *   Solution: Identifying and securing the source of the noise, which may involve adding padding or tightening fasteners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the complexity and if performed at a shop).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Subaru Legacy generally has a good reputation for reliability. However, some owners have reported issues such as excessive oil consumption with the 2.5L engine, hesitation or jerky acceleration from the CVT, infotainment system glitches, and premature battery drain. Rattling noises within the interior have also been reported. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, with some being minor annoyances while others require more significant repairs.
