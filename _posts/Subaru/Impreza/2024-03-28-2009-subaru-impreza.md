**Introduction:**
The 2009 Subaru Impreza is a compact car that offers a choice of two engines: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine with 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder boxer engine with 224 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque. The base engine comes standard with a five-speed manual transmission, while the turbocharged engine comes with a four-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard on all models. The Impreza is praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and safety features, but some owners have experienced various issues.

**Engine**

**2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine**

* **Head gasket failure:** Leaks coolant and oil, resulting in overheating and potential engine damage.
* **Intake manifold leak:** Causes a vacuum leak, leading to rough idling and reduced power.
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** Can cause the timing chain to slip, resulting in engine damage.

**2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder boxer engine**

* **Turbocharger failure:** Loss of power, smoke from the exhaust, and increased oil consumption.
* **Intake manifold runner control valve failure:** Causes a vacuum leak, leading to reduced power and fuel efficiency.
* **Crank pulley failure:** Can cause the crankshaft to seize and result in major engine damage.

**Transmission**

**Five-speed manual transmission**

* **Clutch master or slave cylinder failure:** Loss of clutch pressure, making it difficult or impossible to shift gears.
* **Synchro failure:** Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears.

**Four-speed automatic transmission**

* **Transmission fluid leak:** Can cause the transmission to overheat and malfunction.
* **Valve body failure:** Causes erratic shifting or transmission slipping.
* **Torque converter failure:** Can lead to loss of power and transmission failure.

**Suspension**

* **Strut mount failure:** Causes clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension.
* **Sway bar end link failure:** Can lead to excessive body roll and reduced handling.
* **Rear subframe cracking:** A serious safety issue that can result in the rear wheels detaching from the vehicle.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** Can lead to battery discharge and electrical system malfunctions.
* **Starter failure:** Difficulty or impossibility starting the engine.
* **Headlight switch failure:** Causes the headlights to flicker or not function.

**Exterior**

* **Door lock actuator failure:** Difficulty locking or unlocking the doors.
* **Window regulator failure:** Window does not roll up or down properly.
* **Wheel bearing failure:** Causes a grinding or humming noise from the wheels.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard rattle:** Excessive noise from the dashboard.
* **HVAC system failure:** Can lead to poor heating or cooling performance.
* **Seat heater failure:** Seat heaters do not function or become too hot.

**Summary:**
The 2009 Subaru Impreza has a number of potential issues, particularly with its engines, transmissions, and suspension. While not all models are affected by these problems, they can be costly to repair. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and consider regular maintenance and inspections to minimize the risk of costly repairs.
