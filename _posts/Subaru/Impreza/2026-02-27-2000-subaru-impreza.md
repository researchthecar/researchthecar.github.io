- **Cost:** $1200 - $2500

**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil drips under the vehicle, low oil level, burning oil smell.
- **Solution:** Replacement of seals and gaskets (e.g., valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket).
- **Cost:** $300 - $700


### 2.5L EJ25 DOHC Turbo (WRX/STI variants - though less common in base 2000 Impreza, important for context)
**Head Gasket Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Similar to SOHC, but can be exacerbated by higher boost pressures.
- **Solution:** Replacement of head gaskets, often with reinforced versions.
- **Cost:** $1500 - $3000

**Turbocharger Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of power, excessive smoke, whining noises from the turbo.

## Transmission

### 5-Speed Manual Transmission
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Clutch kit replacement (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $700 - $1200

**Synchronizer Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Grinding noise when shifting into certain gears, difficulty engaging gears.
- **Solution:** Transmission internal repair or rebuild.
- **Cost:** $1500 - $3000


### 4-Speed Automatic Transmission
**Harsh Shifting / Slipping**
- **Symptoms:** Jerky gear changes, delayed engagement, slipping between gears.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2500


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Struts/Shocks**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, poor handling, visible leaks from shock absorbers.
- **Solution:** Replacement of struts and/or shocks.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000

**Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn suspension components.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700


## Electrical

### General Electrical System
**Alternator Failure**

### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Subaru Impreza is a capable vehicle with a generally positive reliability record, especially its all-wheel-drive system. However, potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues such as head gasket failures on the 2.5L engines, which can be a significant repair cost. Both manual and automatic transmissions can experience wear over time, with clutch wear being common for manuals and potential for harsh shifting in automatics. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are also susceptible to wear. Electrical issues, particularly with the alternator and window regulators, can occur. Exterior rust is a concern for vehicles in rust-prone climates. Overall, while not immune to problems, many of these issues are age-related and can be managed with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
