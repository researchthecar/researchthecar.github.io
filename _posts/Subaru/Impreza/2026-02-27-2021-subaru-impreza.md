### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Subaru Impreza demonstrates strong overall reliability, particularly with its standard 2.0L Boxer engine and manual transmission. The CVT, while generally dependable, has a few reported instances of hesitation or minor jerking, often resolvable with software updates. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment screen unresponsiveness and occasional premature battery failure, are the most common non-wear-and-tear issues. Minor concerns like wiper blade wear and HVAC blower motor issues are also noted but are not indicative of systemic problems. For prospective buyers, the Impreza remains a solid choice for dependable transportation, especially for those valuing its standard AWD.
