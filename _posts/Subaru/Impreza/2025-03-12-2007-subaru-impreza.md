The 2007 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive and sporty handling. It was offered with two primary engine options: a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder in the WRX model producing 224 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Impreza for its reliability, all-weather capability, and fun-to-drive nature.
