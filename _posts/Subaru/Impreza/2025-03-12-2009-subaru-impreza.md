The 2009 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive and practicality. Engine options include a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine in the WRX model, which produces 265 horsepower and 244 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Impreza's all-weather capability and fuel efficiency, while some criticisms include the relatively basic interior and potential for higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, external coolant leaks. The head gaskets on this era of Subaru were known to fail prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the head gaskets with updated, multi-layer steel gaskets is the common fix. Machining the cylinder heads to ensure proper sealing may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: There is no definitive solution for this issue other than regularly monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be attempted, but this is a costly repair with no guarantee of resolving the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (WRX)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining noise from the turbocharger, excessive oil consumption, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. Diagnosing the cause of the failure (e.g., oil starvation, foreign object damage) is crucial to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Connecting Rod Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking noise from the engine, especially under load. Can lead to catastrophic engine failure. This is often caused by high mileage and aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild or replacement. Replacing the connecting rod bearings may be a temporary fix if caught early, but full engine disassembly and inspection are recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or harsh shifts.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $800 - $2,000+ (valve body/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, clutch pedal feels spongy or sticks.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement, including the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing. Inspecting the flywheel and resurfacing or replacing it is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Humming or grinding noise from the rear of the vehicle, especially noticeable at higher speeds. Noise may change or disappear when turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough idling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor (O2 sensor). Bank 1 Sensor 1 is the most common failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust on the quarter panels or rocker panels, especially in areas where road salt is used.
    *   Solution: Rust repair by cutting out the affected area and welding in new metal, followed by body filler, primer, and paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on severity and area
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Subaru Impreza has several potential issues owners could encounter. The most serious and potentially expensive are engine-related, particularly head gasket failure and oil consumption in the naturally aspirated engine and turbocharger or connecting rod bearing failure in the WRX. Transmission issues, while less common, can still be costly to repair. Suspension, electrical, and exterior issues are generally less severe and less expensive to address. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used 2009 Impreza before purchase.
