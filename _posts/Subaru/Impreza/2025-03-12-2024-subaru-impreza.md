The 2024 Subaru Impreza is a compact hatchback known for its standard all-wheel drive and practicality. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 152 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is available, producing 182 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Impreza for its reliability, standard AWD, and fuel efficiency. Common complaints include the base engine's lack of power and the CVT's driving feel.

**Engine**

**2.0-Liter Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and topping off as needed. If consumption is excessive (more than 1 quart per 1,200 miles), a dealer may perform an oil consumption test to diagnose the root cause. Potential fixes range from PCV valve replacement to piston ring replacement or even engine replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: PCV valve replacement $100-$200, Piston ring replacement $2,000+, Engine replacement $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or jerking during acceleration, especially from a stop or at low speeds. This can manifest as a momentary delay in power delivery or a jerky feeling as the transmission adjusts.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer may improve transmission behavior. In some cases, a CVT fluid change might help. For more severe cases, a CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update $0 - $150, CVT fluid change $200 - $400, CVT replacement $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Simulated Gear Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Although technically a CVT, Subaru programs in "gear shifts" to try to make it feel more like a conventional automatic. Some owners report these shifts are clunky, poorly timed, or generate excessive revving.
    *   Solution: There is no definitive fix. Some owners try aftermarket tuning or modifications, but these may void the warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash entirely. This may require a system reboot to restore functionality.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer may address these issues. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update $0 - $150, Head unit replacement $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle sits unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Ensure all accessories are turned off when the vehicle is not in use. A dealer can test the battery and charging system to identify any potential issues. Potential fixes include battery replacement or addressing parasitic drains.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement $150 - $300, Parasitic drain diagnosis and repair $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the windshield being prone to cracking from minor impacts.
    *   Solution: Windshield replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises coming from the dashboard or door panels.
    *   Solution: Identifying and securing the source of the rattle. This may involve adding foam padding or tightening loose screws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on labor

**Summary**
The 2024 Subaru Impreza generally offers a reliable driving experience, but owners have reported some common issues. Engine-related problems, particularly excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L engine, can be a concern and potentially costly to repair. The CVT transmission has some drivability complaints, but is generally reliable. Electrical gremlins, like infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also prevalent. While not every Impreza will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of them and factor them into their purchasing decision. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but some issues can be expensive to address, requiring engine or transmission replacement.
