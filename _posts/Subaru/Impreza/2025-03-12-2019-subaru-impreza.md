The 2019 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It comes with a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission (base model only) or a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the Impreza's safety features, fuel economy, and all-weather capability, but some find the acceleration sluggish and the CVT transmission uninspiring.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by the low oil light illuminating, or noticeable oil consumption on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: Subaru has issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) #02-169-22 for 2018-2020 model year Imprezas experiencing this issue. The TSB suggests an updated engine control module (ECM) software to address possible oil consumption. Some owners have reported needing piston ring replacement, but this is less common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically covered under warranty. Piston ring replacement can cost $2,000 - $4,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Lineartronic CVT**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation, jerking, or shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This is often more pronounced when the engine is cold or during initial acceleration.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, CVT valve body replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update is typically covered under warranty. Valve body replacement can cost $1,500 - $2,500.
    *   Recalls: None Found
* **Premature Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failure of the CVT transmission at or around 100,000 miles. Can also include slipping between gears, hesitation or shaking at certain speeds, and/or complete failure of the transmission.
    * Solution: Full replacement of the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $9,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature wear of struts, shocks, and sway bar links, leading to diminished ride quality, clunking noises, and compromised handling. This may be more common in areas with poor road conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the component and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the battery draining overnight or after a short period of inactivity, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is required to identify the source of the parasitic drain. Possible causes include a faulty sensor, relay, or aftermarket accessory. Replacement of the battery and/or faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates may address the issue. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free. Infotainment unit replacement can cost $500 - $1,500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the windshield is prone to cracking, even from small impacts.
    *   Solution: Windshield replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Reflection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can create a significant reflection on the windshield, especially in bright sunlight, potentially impairing visibility.
    *   Solution: Use of a dashboard cover or application of a matte film to reduce glare.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Subaru Impreza, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission, with reports of hesitation, jerking, and premature wear. Oil consumption in the engine is also a prevalent issue. While the cost of some repairs, such as software updates, may be relatively low, major repairs like CVT or engine work can be quite expensive. Owners should pay close attention to these potential problems and perform regular maintenance to mitigate the risk of costly repairs.
