The 2016 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. Available as a sedan or hatchback, it offers a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Impreza for its reliability in snowy conditions, good fuel economy, and spacious interior for its class. Common dislikes include the somewhat underpowered engine and the sometimes-noisy CVT transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L 4-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating or noticing a significant drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Subaru has performed oil consumption tests and, if deemed excessive, replaced the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (if piston ring replacement is necessary)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mass Air Flow sensor is a part that measures the mass of air that enters an engine. If this sensor is faulty, the car can idle irregularly, stall, and have diminished power.
    *   Solution: The solution is to replace the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be caused by issues with the CVT's internal components or software.
    *   Solution: A software update or replacement of the CVT valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ (depending on whether a valve body replacement or full transmission replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT can make a loud whining noise during acceleration.
    *   Solution: A software update or full CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7,000 (depending on whether a software update or full transmission replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Front Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of the front lower control arm bushings, leading to clunking noises from the front suspension, particularly when going over bumps. This can also affect steering precision.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front lower control arm bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dead Battery**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the battery has died early.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Oxygen Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car may idle roughly, misfire, have diminished power, and have a poor gas mileage. The check engine light will also illuminate on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the windshield cracking easily, even from small impacts.
    *   Solution: Windshield replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The A/C can stop blowing cold air. This is often the result of a leak in the system.
    *   Solution: Repair the leak, recharge the system, or replace the compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Subaru Impreza, while generally reliable, has some common issues to be aware of. The most significant issues revolve around the excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L engine and potential problems with the CVT transmission, which can lead to costly repairs. Other, less severe issues include premature wear of suspension components and potential electrical problems. Overall, potential buyers should pay close attention to the vehicle's service history, check for signs of excessive oil consumption, and test the CVT thoroughly during a test drive.
