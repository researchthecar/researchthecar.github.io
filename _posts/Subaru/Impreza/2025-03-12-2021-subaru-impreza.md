The 2021 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive and fuel efficiency. It offers a comfortable ride and good visibility, making it a practical choice for daily commuting. However, some owners find its acceleration lacking and the infotainment system to be somewhat dated. All 2021 Impreza models come equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a five-speed manual (on the base model) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) on all other trims.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil level light illuminating on the dashboard, and in some cases, visible blue exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Subaru has released technical service bulletins (TSBs) addressing oil consumption concerns in certain engines. The recommended fix typically involves performing an oil consumption test to measure the rate of oil loss. If the consumption exceeds a specified threshold, the dealer may recommend replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2021 Subaru Impreza generally presents with manageable issues. The most concerning issue is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the engine, which can be costly to repair if it requires piston ring replacement. CVT issues, infotainment glitches, battery drain, and fragile windshields are also reported, but seem to be less frequent. While some issues can be addressed with software updates or minor repairs, more significant problems may require more extensive and costly solutions. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and condition before making a purchase.
