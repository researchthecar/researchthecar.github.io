**Summary**

The 2005 Subaru Impreza, particularly the WRX, can be prone to engine and transmission issues that can be costly to repair. Head gasket failures on the naturally aspirated engines and turbocharger/oil starvation problems on the WRX are significant concerns. Rust is also a factor, depending on the car's location and maintenance history. Suspension and electrical issues are fairly typical for a car of this age. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
