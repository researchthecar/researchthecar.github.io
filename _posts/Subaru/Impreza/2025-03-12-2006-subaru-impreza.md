The 2006 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive and sporty handling. Engine options for this year include a 2.5L naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, primarily found in the Impreza 2.5i and Outback Sport trims, and a turbocharged 2.5L four-cylinder producing 230 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque in the WRX trim, and 293 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque in the WRX STI. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the Impreza's reliability, all-weather capability, and fun-to-drive nature. However, common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, particularly in the turbocharged models, and some reliability concerns with specific engine components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated (2.5i, Outback Sport)**
*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks (external or internal), white smoke from exhaust, bubbling in the coolant overflow tank.
    *   Solution: Replace the head gaskets. It's recommended to have both head gaskets replaced simultaneously, along with resurfacing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes more oil than usual between oil changes, requiring frequent top-ups.
    *   Solution: In some cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil or using oil additives may temporarily reduce consumption. For severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for oil additives or alternative oils, $2,500 - $5,000+ for piston ring replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbocharged (WRX, WRX STI)**

*   **Ringland Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of compression, rough running, excessive oil consumption, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Engine rebuild with stronger pistons and rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost, whistling or grinding noises from the turbocharger, and potential engine damage if debris enters the engine.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as Naturally Aspirated 2.5L, however turbocharged engines place more stress on head gaskets causing them to fail at lower milage. Overheating, coolant leaks (external or internal), white smoke from exhaust, bubbling in the coolant overflow tank.
    *   Solution: Replace the head gaskets. It's recommended to have both head gaskets replaced simultaneously, along with resurfacing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, and high engagement point.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. More severe problems may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for fluid flush, $800 - $2,000+ for valve body, $2,500 - $5,000+ for rebuild/replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise from the rear wheels, which worsens with speed.
    *   Solution: Wheel bearing replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or clunking sounds from the suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Strut mount replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400+ per corner
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough running engine.
    *   Solution: Oxygen sensor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per sensor

**Summary**

The 2006 Subaru Impreza, while a generally reliable vehicle, can experience issues that vary depending on the engine configuration. Head gasket issues are common across both naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines, while the turbocharged models are susceptible to ringland and turbocharger failures. Suspension components like wheel bearings and strut mounts are also known to wear out. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the vehicle's condition. The cost to fix these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major engine work.
