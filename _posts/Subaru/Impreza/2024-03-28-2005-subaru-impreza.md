**Introduction:**

The 2005 Subaru Impreza is a compact sedan or hatchback that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.0-liter naturally-aspirated four-cylinder with 123 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options included a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 227 horsepower and 216 lb-ft of torque, paired with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission; and a non-turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Impreza was praised for its handling and all-wheel-drive capability, but criticized for its lackluster interior and noisy engine.
