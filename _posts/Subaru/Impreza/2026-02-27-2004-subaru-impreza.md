### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Subaru Impreza, while offering engaging driving dynamics, particularly in its turbocharged variants, presents several potential reliability concerns. The EJ-series engines, especially the turbocharged versions found in the WRX and STI, are prone to head gasket failures and, in higher-performance models, internal component damage like piston ring issues. Manual transmissions can experience synchronizer wear, while the STI's 6-speed requires careful attention. Electrical gremlins like faulty window regulators and instrument clusters are not uncommon. Rust can also be a significant issue depending on climate. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are well-documented and repairable, making proactive maintenance and awareness key for owners of this enthusiast-focused vehicle.
