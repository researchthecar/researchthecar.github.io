**Introduction**

The 2006 Subaru Impreza is a compact car available in sedan and hatchback body styles. It offers two engine options: a 2.0-liter flat-four producing 158 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter flat-four turbocharged engine producing 224 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

People like the Impreza for its comfortable ride, excellent fuel economy, and all-wheel drive capability. However, they dislike its underpowered base engine, cramped interior, and lack of features.

**Engine**

**2.0-liter Flat-Four**

* **Leaking Head Gaskets:** Head gaskets can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, overheating, and a decrease in coolant level. The solution is to replace the head gaskets, which typically costs $1,200 - $1,600+.
* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt can break, causing catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include difficulty starting, rough idling, and a rattling noise from the engine. The solution is to replace the timing belt, which typically costs $500 - $700+.
* **Oil Consumption:** Some engines may consume excessive oil, requiring frequent top-ups. The problem can be caused by worn piston rings, valve guides, or turbocharger seals. The solution varies depending on the cause but can cost $1,000+.

**2.5-liter Flat-Four Turbocharged**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail, causing a loss of power and decreased fuel economy. Symptoms include a whining noise from the engine, smoke from the exhaust, and a decrease in boost pressure. The solution is to replace the turbocharger, which typically costs $2,000 - $3,000+.
* **Secondary Air Injection System Failure:** The secondary air injection system helps reduce emissions but can fail, causing rough idling and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the faulty components, which typically costs $400 - $600+.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Failure:** The clutch can wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting or a grinding noise. The solution is to replace the clutch, which typically costs $800 - $1,200+.

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** The transmission may slip or shudder during gear changes. Symptoms include a loss of power, delayed acceleration, and a whining noise. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission, which typically costs $2,000 - $3,500+.

**CVT**

* **Chain Stretch:** The CVT chain can stretch over time, causing slipping, hesitation, and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the CVT chain, which typically costs $1,500 - $2,000+.

**Suspension**

* **Strut Mount Failure:** The front strut mounts can fail, causing a clunking noise and decreased ride comfort. The solution is to replace the strut mounts, which typically costs $200 - $300+.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, causing a loss of electrical power. Symptoms include dim headlights, a dead battery, and a warning light on the dashboard. The solution is to replace the alternator, which typically costs $400 - $600+.
* **Battery Drain:** Some Imprezas may experience battery drain, caused by a faulty alternator or parasitic draw from other electrical components. The solution is to diagnose and repair the source of the drain, which can cost $100 - $500+.

**Interior**

* **Loose Door Panels:** Door panels may become loose and rattle. The solution is to tighten or replace the door panel clips, which typically costs $100 - $200+.
* **Window Switch Failure:** The window switches may fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. The solution is to replace the faulty switches, which typically costs $200 - $400+.

**Summary**

The 2006 Subaru Impreza is a reliable and fuel-efficient car with a spacious interior and good all-weather capability. However, it is not without its issues, including head gasket leaks, turbocharger failure, and transmission slippage. These issues can be costly to fix, but they are not common and most Imprezas will not experience any major problems.

Overall, the Impreza is a good value for the price, but potential buyers should be aware of its potential issues before making a purchase.
