**Introduction:**
The 1997 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its affordability, reliability, and sporty handling. It was available with three engine options: a 1.8L Naturally Aspirated (NA) engine, a 2.2L NA engine, and a 2.5L Turbocharged engine. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic.

**Engine**
**1.8L NA Engine**
* **Head Gasket Failure:** Leaking or blown head gasket, resulting in oil and coolant leaks, overheating, and reduced engine performance. $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Leaking intake manifold gasket, leading to vacuum leaks, rough idling, and reduced fuel efficiency. $500 - $1,000
**2.2L NA Engine**
* **Timing Belt Failure:** Broken or slipped timing belt, causing engine damage and possible catastrophic failure. Routine replacement is recommended every 60,000-100,000 miles. $500 - $1,000
**2.5L Turbocharged Engine**
* **Rod Knock:** Noisy knocking or rattling sound from the engine, indicating worn or damaged connecting rod bearings. $3,000 - $5,000+
* **Turbocharger Failure:** Failed or malfunctioning turbocharger, leading to reduced boost pressure, power loss, and increased exhaust smoke. $1,500 - $3,000+

**Transmission**
**5-Speed Manual**
* **Clutch Failure:** Worn or damaged clutch, resulting in slipping, difficulty shifting, or inability to engage gears. $500 - $1,500

**Suspension**
* **Strut Failure:** Worn or failing struts, causing poor handling, reduced stability, and increased noise. $500 - $1,000 per pair
* **Ball Joint Failure:** Worn or damaged ball joints, leading to play in the steering and suspension, and increased tire wear. $200 - $500 per joint

**Electrical**
* **Alternator Failure:** Malfunctioning alternator, resulting in insufficient charging of the battery, electrical problems, and possible engine stalling. $500 - $1,000
* **Battery Failure:** Premature battery failure due to age, deep discharge, or electrical issues. $100 - $200+

**Exterior**
* **Door Lock Actuator Failure:** Faulty door lock actuators, causing difficulty locking or unlocking doors, or intermittent door operation. $200 - $500 per lock

**Interior**
* **Broken Window Regulators:** Malfunctioning window regulators, resulting in difficulty rolling up or down windows. $200 - $500 per window
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Inoperative climate control system due to failed blower motor, control module, or wiring issues. $500 - $1,500+

**Summary:**
Overall, the 1997 Subaru Impreza has some common issues that can be costly to repair. Engine problems, particularly head gasket failure for the 1.8L engine and turbocharger failure for the 2.5L engine, are the most significant concerns. Transmission, suspension, and electrical issues are also prevalent, though they tend to be less severe and less expensive to fix.
