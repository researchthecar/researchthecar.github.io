The 2002 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel-drive and rally-inspired performance, particularly in the WRX trim. Engine options included a 2.5L SOHC naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing around 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0L DOHC four-cylinder engine (WRX only) producing around 227 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. People often praise the Impreza for its reliability, handling in all weather conditions, and sporty character, while common complaints include road noise and fuel economy (especially with the WRX).

**Summary**

The 2002 Subaru Impreza, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners should be aware of. Head gasket failures (especially on the 2.5L) and oil leaks are significant engine concerns. Suspension components wear with age, requiring occasional replacement. Electrical issues with sensors can also occur. Rust can be a major issue, particularly in regions with harsh winters. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the severity and location of the problem, but addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the Impreza's reliability and performance.
