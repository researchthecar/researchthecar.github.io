**2002 Subaru Impreza Introduction**

The 2002 Subaru Impreza is a compact car available in sedan and hatchback body styles. It is powered by a 2.0-liter, four-cylinder boxer engine that produces 125 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. The Impreza is offered with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

* **2.0-liter, four-cylinder boxer engine**
    * **Head gasket failure:** Premature failure of the head gasket can lead to coolant and oil leaks, overheating, and engine damage. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and overheating. The fix involves replacing the head gasket and associated components. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500-$2,500.
    * **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt is responsible for synchronizing the movement of the camshaft and crankshaft. Failure of the timing belt can result in catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include engine stalling, difficulty starting, and unusual noises from the engine. The fix involves replacing the timing belt and any damaged components. Estimated cost to fix: $500-$1,000.

**Transmission**

* **Five-speed manual transmission**
    * **Grinding gears:** Difficulty shifting gears smoothly can indicate worn-out synchronizers or damaged gear teeth. The fix involves replacing the affected components. Estimated cost to fix: $500-$1,000.
* **Four-speed automatic transmission**
    * **Slipping gears:** Failure of the transmission to engage gears or a loss of power during acceleration may indicate a problem with the transmission clutches or valve body. The fix requires rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500-$3,000.

**Suspension**

* **Lower control arm bushings:** Premature failure of the lower control arm bushings can cause a variety of suspension issues, such as tire alignment problems, excessive vibration, and instability during cornering. The fix involves replacing the worn bushings. Estimated cost to fix: $200-$400.
* **Rear suspension springs:** Sagging or broken rear suspension springs can affect the ride height and handling of the vehicle. Replacing the springs is the most common solution. Estimated cost to fix: $150-$300.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** A failing alternator may not provide sufficient power to the electrical system, leading to battery drain and potential electrical failures. Symptoms include dim headlights, slow cranking, and warning lights on the dashboard. The fix involves replacing the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $300-$600.
* **Ignition coil failure:** A faulty ignition coil can prevent the spark plugs from receiving power, causing engine misfires and rough running. Symptoms include loss of power, difficulty starting, and uneven engine performance. The fix involves replacing the ignition coil and associated components. Estimated cost to fix: $200-$500.
* **Battery drain:** A parasitic draw on the battery can lead to a drained battery, even when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by faulty electrical components, such as a faulty alternator diode or a malfunctioning electrical module. The fix involves identifying and repairing the affected component. Estimated cost to fix: $50-$200.

**Exterior**

* **Tail light condensation:** Moisture buildup inside the tail lights is a common issue caused by a faulty seal. This can cause the tail lights to become obscured and less visible to other drivers. The fix involves replacing the tail light assembly or resealing the affected areas. Estimated cost to fix: $100-$250.
* **Fog light failure:** The fog lights may fail to illuminate or may dim over time due to faulty bulbs, wiring, or a malfunctioning fog light switch. The fix involves replacing the affected components. Estimated cost to fix: $50-$200.

**Interior**

* **Clock failure:** Malfunctioning or inaccurate clock displays are a common issue that can be caused by a faulty clock module or wiring problems. The fix involves replacing the clock module or repairing the wiring. Estimated cost to fix: $100-$200.
* **Heater core leak:** Leaks in the heater core can lead to coolant loss and the presence of a sweet smell inside the vehicle. The fix involves replacing the heater core and associated gaskets. Estimated cost to fix: $500-$1,000.

**Other**

* **Brake pads and rotors:** Worn brake pads and warped rotors can reduce braking effectiveness and lead to excessive noise. Replacing or resurfacing the affected parts is the most common solution. Estimated cost to fix: $200-$500.

****

**Summary**

The 2002 Subaru Impreza is generally a reliable vehicle, although it has experienced some notable issues. The most severe problems include head gasket failure and transmission failure, which can be costly to repair. However, many of the other issues are relatively minor and can be addressed at a reasonable cost. Overall, the Impreza remains a popular choice for its affordability, performance, and all-weather capability.
