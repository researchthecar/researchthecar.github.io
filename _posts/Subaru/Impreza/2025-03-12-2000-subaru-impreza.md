The 2000 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and rally-inspired performance. The base engine is a 2.2L SOHC flat-4 producing around 142 horsepower and 149 lb-ft of torque. A 2.5L SOHC flat-4 with around 165 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque was available on the RS trim. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. People appreciate the Impreza for its all-weather capability, handling, and reliability. Common dislikes include the relatively basic interior, some road noise, and fuel economy that isn't stellar compared to front-wheel-drive competitors.
