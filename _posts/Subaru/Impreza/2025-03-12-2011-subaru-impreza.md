The 2011 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive and practicality. It offered a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Impreza's handling and fuel economy for an AWD vehicle, but some dislike the relatively small interior and somewhat bland styling.

**Engine**

**2.5L Naturally Aspirated 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2011 Impreza models, particularly those with higher mileage, have been reported to consume excessive amounts of engine oil. This can manifest as a low oil level warning light illuminating frequently, the need to add oil between scheduled oil changes, and, in severe cases, engine damage.
    *   Solution: Addressing this can involve replacing the PCV valve, performing an engine decarbonization, or, as a last resort, replacing the piston rings or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+ depending on the severity and chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Subaru's of this era are known for head gasket failures. Symptoms may include overheating, coolant leaks (internal or external), white smoke from the exhaust, and bubbling in the coolant overflow tank.
    *   Solution: Head gasket replacement is the standard repair. This may also involve machining the cylinder heads to ensure proper sealing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing hard or jerky shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $800 - $1500+ (valve body)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature clutch wear or failure can occur. Symptoms include slipping clutch, difficulty shifting, and a high engagement point.
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is the standard repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable humming or grinding noise from the rear of the vehicle, which increases with speed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination, poor fuel economy, and potentially rough engine running. The oxygen sensors monitor the exhaust gases.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. Can be caused by a parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and repair the faulty component. This may involve testing various circuits and components to pinpoint the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the ideal solution, but it can be expensive. Dashboard covers or aftermarket repair kits are alternative options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) to $1,500+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Subaru Impreza, while a reliable vehicle, has some common issues. The most concerning are the engine-related issues, such as excessive oil consumption and head gasket failures, which can be costly to repair. Other issues, like suspension and electrical problems, are generally less severe and less expensive to address. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these common problems before making a purchase, paying close attention to the engine's oil level and any potential leaks.
