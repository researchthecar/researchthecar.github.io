The 2018 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. The Impreza is available as a sedan or hatchback. The sole engine option is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder Boxer engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options are a 5-speed manual or a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the Impreza's safety features, fuel economy, and all-weather capability. Common dislikes include the underpowered engine, the CVT's droning sound during acceleration, and some reported infotainment system issues.
