The 2014 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It was available as a sedan or a hatchback. The sole engine option was a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder (Boxer) engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People generally like the Impreza for its reliability, all-weather capability, and fuel economy, while some common complaints include its relatively underpowered engine and the noise level of the CVT transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Horizontally Opposed Four-Cylinder (FB20)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, often requiring owners to add oil between changes. This can lead to low oil levels, potential engine damage, and premature catalytic converter failure.
    *   Solution: Subaru issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) for oil consumption issues which might include re-programming the ECU or replacing the short block if oil consumption is excessive after the ECU re-program.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (short block replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (per coil)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, rough running engine, illuminated check engine light. Diagnosing the faulty sensor with an OBD2 scanner.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Lineartronic)**

    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the CVT valve body. In some cases, a complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Chain Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or whining noises from the transmission, slipping, and loss of power. Can also cause the vehicle to stall completely or refuse to move.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT chain. In severe cases, a complete transmission replacement is required.

**Summary:**

The 2014 Subaru Impreza has some common issues, with the most concerning being the potential for excessive oil consumption and CVT transmission problems. The oil consumption issue can lead to costly engine repairs, while CVT issues can result in significant transmission repairs or replacement. Suspension and electrical problems are also present but are generally less severe and less costly to repair. Dashboard cracking is a cosmetic issue but can be unsightly and impact resale value. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and condition before purchasing.
