**Summary**

The 2003 Subaru Impreza, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to watch out for. Engine problems, particularly head gasket failures on the 2.5L engine and turbocharger issues on the 2.0L WRX, can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical issues are also fairly common, although generally less expensive to address. Rust is also a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the car for these issues and factor repair costs into their purchase decision.
