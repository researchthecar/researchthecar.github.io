### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Subaru Impreza, particularly the WRX and STI models, can be prone to more significant engine issues like piston ring land failure and connecting rod bearing wear, often exacerbated by aggressive driving or inadequate maintenance. Naturally aspirated models are more susceptible to head gasket failures. Transmission issues, while not universal, can include clutch wear on manuals and torque converter problems on automatics. Suspension components like sway bar links can wear out, and electrical issues such as alternator failure are also reported. Rust can be a concern on the exterior, especially in colder climates. Overall, while offering engaging performance, potential buyers should be aware of these common reliability concerns and factor in potential repair costs.
