The 2023 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive, a rarity in its class. It comes with a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine, producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission (base model only) or a Lineartronic Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). People often appreciate the Impreza's fuel efficiency, standard AWD, and overall practicality. Common criticisms include its somewhat lackluster acceleration and basic interior features in lower trims.

**Engine**

**2.0L Horizontally Opposed Four-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms may include low oil level warnings, engine knocking, or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The repair varies depending on the severity. It may involve replacing the PCV valve, valve stem seals, or piston rings. In some cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve) - $5000+ (Engine Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Misfires**
  * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine misfires. Symptoms may include rough running, CEL codes, loss of power, or poor gas mileage.
  * Solution: The repair varies depending on the cause of the misfire. It may involve replacing the spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Spark Plugs) - $1000+ (Fuel Injectors)
  * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Lineartronic CVT**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly from a standstill or at low speeds. This can feel like the transmission is struggling to find the right gear.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $5000+ (CVT Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining noise coming from the transmission area, especially during acceleration. The noise can increase in pitch with vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: This is often a sign of internal wear within the CVT. While a fluid change *might* offer temporary relief, a rebuild or replacement of the CVT is typically necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (Fluid Change) - $5000+ (CVT Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, which controls audio, navigation, and other vehicle functions, may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can be intermittent or occur frequently.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $1000+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Requires diagnosis to determine the source of the parasitic drain. Possible causes include faulty sensors, modules not shutting down properly, or a defective battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+ (Varies greatly depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported windshields cracking easily, sometimes with no apparent impact.

**Interior**

* **Rattling/Buzzing Noises**
  * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling and buzzing noises, particularly in the dashboard, door panels, and rear hatch area.
  * Solution: Often requires locating and isolating the source of the noise. Possible fixes include tightening loose fasteners, adding foam padding, or replacing damaged clips.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Subaru Impreza, while generally reliable, does exhibit a few common issues. The most concerning are related to the CVT transmission and potential engine issues. While not every Impreza will experience these problems, they are worth being aware of, especially for those considering purchasing a used model. Repair costs can range from relatively minor (e.g., software updates) to significant (e.g., CVT or engine replacement), so a thorough inspection before purchase is highly recommended.
