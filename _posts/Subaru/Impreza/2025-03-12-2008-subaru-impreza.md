The 2008 Subaru Impreza marked a significant redesign for the model, moving to a hatchback-focused design while still offering a sedan. Engine options included a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 170 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque and a turbocharged 2.5-liter engine in the WRX trim producing 224 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (depending on trim and engine). Owners often appreciated the Impreza's standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and fuel economy. Common complaints include the somewhat underpowered base engine, road noise, and the relatively bland interior compared to rivals.

**Summary**

The 2008 Subaru Impreza has some common issues, with engine-related problems being the most potentially severe and costly, especially for the WRX model. Head gasket issues in the naturally aspirated engine and potential oil starvation in the WRX can lead to major repairs. Suspension and electrical problems are generally less expensive to address. Rust can be a significant issue in certain climates. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems, especially signs of engine issues and rust.
