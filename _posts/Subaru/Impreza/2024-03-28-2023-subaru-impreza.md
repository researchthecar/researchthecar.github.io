**Introduction:**

The 2023 Subaru Impreza is a compact car that offers a choice of two engines: a 2.0-liter flat-four with 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter flat-four with 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Impreza is known for its spacious interior, standard all-wheel drive, and good fuel economy. However, it has also been criticized for its lackluster performance and unrefined interior.
