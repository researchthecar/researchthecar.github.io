**Summary**

The 2001 Subaru Impreza, while a reliable and enjoyable car, is subject to common issues typical of vehicles of its age. The most concerning problems are engine-related, specifically head gasket failure in the 2.5L engine and oil starvation in the 2.0L WRX engine, which can be costly to repair. Rust is another significant issue, particularly in areas with harsh winter conditions. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also be expensive. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when making a purchase decision.
