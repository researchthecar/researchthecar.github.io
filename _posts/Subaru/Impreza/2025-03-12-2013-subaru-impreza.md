The 2013 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. Engine options include a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder (Boxer) engine, producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the Impreza's handling in various weather conditions and its fuel economy. However, some dislike its relatively low power and somewhat bland interior.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2013 Imprezas, particularly those built within a specific date range, experience excessive oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, low oil level warnings, and potentially engine damage if oil levels are not monitored and maintained.
    *   Solution: Subaru issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) and extended warranty coverage for affected vehicles. The fix often involves replacing the piston rings and potentially other engine components. A software update may also be performed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair and whether it's covered by warranty)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Spring Recall**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Certain 2013 Imprezas may have been subject to a valve spring recall. Defective valve springs could fracture, leading to engine stalling or failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected valve springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered by the recall (free of charge to the owner if performed by an authorized Subaru dealer)
    *   Recalls: NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V544000

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report hesitation upon acceleration, particularly from a stop. Jerking or shuddering during low-speed driving can also occur.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (for software update); $4,000 - $8,000 (for CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Wheel Bearings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of the rear wheel bearings. Symptoms include a humming or grinding noise coming from the rear wheels, especially noticeable at higher speeds.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per wheel (parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the car is not driven frequently. This can result in difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing parasitic draws. This may involve replacing the battery, checking the charging system, and testing for electrical shorts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the cause of the drain)

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Subaru Impreza has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concern is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the engine, which can lead to costly repairs. The CVT transmission can also exhibit hesitation or jerking, and in rare cases require replacement. Rear wheel bearings are prone to wearing out and prematurely failing. Electrical issues, such as battery drain, can occur, and dashboard cracking is a cosmetic concern for some owners. The valve spring recall is important to verify as completed if purchasing a used model. Overall, while the Impreza is a reliable car, addressing these potential issues is crucial for long-term ownership.
