The 2022 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder boxer engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque.

**Summary**
The 2022 Subaru Impreza exhibits a mix of minor and moderate issues. The oil consumption issue with the engine and the potential for CVT issues, particularly hesitation or valve body failure, are the most concerning due to the potential for higher repair costs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery problems are more common, while suspension and interior issues are less prevalent but still reported. Overall, while the Impreza maintains a reputation for reliability, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
