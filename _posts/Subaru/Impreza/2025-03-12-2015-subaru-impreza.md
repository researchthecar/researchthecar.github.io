The 2015 Subaru Impreza is a compact car known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. Engine options for the 2015 Impreza include a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated horizontally opposed 4-cylinder (boxer) engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Impreza for its reliability, safety features, and all-weather capability. Some common dislikes include the somewhat lackluster acceleration and the sometimes-noisy CVT transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated Boxer Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000 - 3,000 miles. Blue-ish smoke may be visible from the exhaust pipe.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success switching to a different brand or weight of oil. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating are common symptoms. OBDII scan tool will report a misfire code, likely pointing to a specific cylinder.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil. It is recommended to replace all coils at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+ depending on the number of coils replaced and if it is DIY or performed by a technician.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Harsh Engagement/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have complained of harsh engagement, jerking, or hesitation when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer can sometimes improve the shift quality. Fluid changes can also help. In severe cases, valve body or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for fluid change; $800-$1,500 for valve body; $4,000 - $7,000 for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, jerking, hard shifts, and/or failure to shift into gear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Strut Mount Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps. This is often attributed to worn or faulty rear strut mounts.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear strut mounts can resolve the noise. It's often recommended to replace both rear strut mounts at the same time for balanced performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 for parts and labor to replace both rear strut mounts.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or excessive battery drain, particularly when the vehicle sits for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Test the charging system and look for parasitic draws on the battery. Replace the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners in hotter climates may experience cracking of the dashboard, particularly in the area around the airbags. This can be unsightly but is generally a cosmetic issue.
    * Solution: There is no permanent fix for this other than replacing the dashboard. Some owners use dashboard covers to conceal the cracks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ for dashboard replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no air flow from the vents. Sometimes, the blower motor may only work intermittently or at certain speeds.
    *   Solution: Replace the HVAC blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Subaru Impreza generally offers good reliability, but owners should be aware of potential issues like excessive oil consumption, CVT issues (particularly jerking or valve body failure), and electrical issues such as battery drain. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to costly repairs. The cost to address these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
