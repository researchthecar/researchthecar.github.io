### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Subaru Ascent demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, with its primary concerns centering around the powertrain, specifically the 2.4L turbocharged engine and the CVT transmission. Owners have reported instances of oil leaks and turbocharger issues, which can be costly to repair. The CVT, while functional, has seen some complaints regarding hesitation and potential overheating. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system's responsiveness and occasional battery drain, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components appear to be relatively robust, with no widespread critical failures reported in these areas. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of engine or transmission trouble are recommended for optimal long-term ownership.
