The 2020 Subaru Ascent is a popular three-row SUV known for its spacious interior, standard all-wheel drive, and safety features. All 2020 Ascents come with the same engine and transmission: a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise its comfortable ride and family-friendly design but commonly report issues with the infotainment system and the CVT.
