The 2023 Subaru Ascent is a popular three-row SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and suite of safety features. All 2023 Ascents are equipped with a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the Ascent for its comfortable ride, family-friendly features, and strong resale value. However, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, excessive fuel consumption (especially when towing), and occasional CVT issues.
