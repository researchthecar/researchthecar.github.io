The 2021 Subaru Ascent is a popular three-row SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, spacious interior, and focus on safety. It comes equipped with a single engine option: a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder (FA24F) producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Ascent's comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and suite of standard safety features. Some common complaints include perceived sluggish acceleration under certain conditions, issues with the infotainment system, and concerns about the long-term reliability of the CVT.
