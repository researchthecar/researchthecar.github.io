**Introduction**

The 2016 Subaru Crosstrek is a compact SUV known for its off-road capabilities, fuel efficiency, and value for money. It is available with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-4 and a 2.5-liter inline-4. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual, a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a 5-speed automatic. The Crosstrek is appreciated for its comfortable and spacious interior, good visibility, and user-friendly infotainment system.
