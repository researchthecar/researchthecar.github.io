The 2017 Subaru Crosstrek is a compact crossover known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It came equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder Boxer engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Crosstrek for its reliability, off-road capability, and spaciousness, but some common complaints include its lack of power and somewhat noisy cabin.

**Summary**

The 2017 Subaru Crosstrek presents a mix of potential issues, with some more serious and costly than others. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and stalling, transmission problems with the CVT, and electrical gremlins like battery drain and infotainment glitches seem to be the most prominent concerns. Suspension issues and exterior faults are also noted but less frequently. The severity and cost of these problems vary, but owners should be aware of the possibility of these issues arising and factor them into their purchasing and maintenance considerations.
