The 2020 Subaru Crosstrek is a popular subcompact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and off-road capability. It generally receives positive reviews for its comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and spacious cargo area for its class. Common complaints often cite its underpowered engine, particularly for highway passing, and its relatively basic interior compared to some competitors. The 2020 Crosstrek offered two engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque (available only on the Limited and Hybrid trims). Transmission options included a six-speed manual (only with the 2.0L) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

**Engine**

**2.0-Liter Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating, or noticing a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success switching to a different brand or viscosity of oil. More severe cases might require a compression test to diagnose potential piston ring issues. In extreme cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder Engine**
No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting or jerking, especially at low speeds or during acceleration. This can feel like a hesitation or a sudden surge of power.
    *   Solution: A software update or a CVT fluid change may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, CVT replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400 for fluid change. $5,000-$8,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or rough roads.
    *   Solution: Inspect and potentially replace worn suspension components such as sway bar bushings, end links, or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect access to navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer may resolve the issue. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update. $500 - $1,500+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, resulting in difficulty starting the vehicle or a dead battery. This issue is more common in vehicles that are not driven frequently or are used for short trips.
    *   Solution: Identify parasitic drain on the battery caused by an electrical component that is not shutting down when the car is off. Replace the battery with an upgraded AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) battery that better handles the electrical demands.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for a new AGM battery. Additional cost to identify parasitic drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the windshield is prone to cracking easily from small impacts, such as pebbles or road debris.
    *   Solution: Windshield replacement. Consider using a thicker aftermarket windshield if replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported that the sunroof may leak or not close properly.
    *   Solution: Check sunroof drain tubes and clear debris. Replacing the sunroof seal or motor may also fix the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300 for cleaning and seal replacement. $300-$1000+ for motor replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Subaru Crosstrek generally proves to be a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The most significant concerns appear to be related to excessive oil consumption in the 2.0-liter engine and occasional harsh shifting with the CVT transmission. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also noted. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, engine or transmission work can be costly. Prospective buyers should inspect the vehicle thoroughly, check for any signs of the reported issues, and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a trusted mechanic.
