**Summary**

The 2019 Subaru Crosstrek, while generally reliable, does exhibit some common issues. The most concerning is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L engine and CVT hesitation/jerking problems. Electrical problems, such as battery drain and Starlink issues, can also be a nuisance. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like replacing the short block or CVT, can be costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2019 Crosstrek.
