The 2021 Subaru Crosstrek is a popular subcompact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and off-road capability. It offers a comfortable ride, a well-equipped interior, and a good safety rating. However, like any vehicle, the 2021 Crosstrek has its share of common problems. The base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Some owners find this engine underpowered, especially when accelerating or climbing hills. A more powerful 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque is available on higher trim levels. Both engines are paired with either a six-speed manual transmission (only on the base trim) or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). People like the Crosstrek's practicality, standard AWD, and fuel economy, but some dislike the base engine's lack of power and the CVT's behavior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Engine**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. The rate of consumption can vary, with some needing to add a quart every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Subaru has issued Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) related to oil consumption in some of their engines. A potential fix can involve replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report instances of the engine stalling, particularly at idle or low speeds. This can occur intermittently and may be accompanied by a rough idle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis can involve checking the mass airflow sensor, idle air control valve (if applicable), and fuel system components. Cleaning or replacing faulty components can resolve the issue. Also could be caused by the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Engine**
*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

*   **Harsh or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds or during acceleration. This may feel like a hesitation or a clunk when the transmission engages.
    *   Solution: Some owners report improvement after a CVT fluid change or a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 (fluid change), $100 - $200 (software update), $4,000 - $7,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hesitation or Lag During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have described a noticeable lag or hesitation when accelerating, especially from a stop. This can make it difficult to merge onto highways or accelerate quickly in traffic.
    *   Solution: This is a characteristic of CVTs, but can be mitigated by proper maintenance. Some owners have reported improvements after resetting the ECU (Engine Control Unit) or performing a CVT fluid change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 (fluid change), $0-$100 (ECU reset)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Wheel Bearings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report premature wear of rear wheel bearings, leading to a humming or grinding noise from the rear of the vehicle, which increases with speed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing(s) is the standard repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per wheel bearing
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for a few days. This can result in difficulty starting the engine or needing to jump-start the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking for parasitic drains (components drawing power when the car is off). Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty door switches, or a failing battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (battery replacement), $100 - $500+ (diagnosis and repair of parasitic drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches such as freezing, screen blackouts, slow response times, or connectivity issues with smartphones.
    *   Solution: Software updates can often resolve these issues. In some cases, a hard reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update), $500 - $1,500+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their windshields are prone to cracking easily, even from small impacts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the windshield.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises in the Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling or buzzing noises emanating from the dashboard area, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: This may require pinpointing the source of the rattle and securing loose components or adding sound-dampening material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Subaru Crosstrek has some notable issues, though it is generally considered a reliable vehicle. The most concerning issues revolve around engine oil consumption and potential CVT transmission problems, which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues such as battery drain and infotainment system glitches are also common complaints. While not all owners will experience these problems, it is important to be aware of them when considering a used 2021 Crosstrek. The severity of these issues varies, but some can lead to significant repair bills.
