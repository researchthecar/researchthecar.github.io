The 2022 Subaru Crosstrek is a popular subcompact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, practicality, and off-road capability. It's available with two main engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0-liter engine can be paired with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 2.5-liter engine is exclusively mated to a CVT. People often appreciate the Crosstrek for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and generous cargo space for its class. Common dislikes include the base engine's lack of power and the somewhat basic interior.
