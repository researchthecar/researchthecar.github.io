The 2024 Subaru Crosstrek is a popular subcompact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, decent fuel economy, and off-road capability. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Some trims offer a more powerful 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, also paired with a Lineartronic CVT. Owners generally appreciate the Crosstrek's practicality, safety features, and standard AWD. Common complaints often revolve around the base engine's lack of power and the somewhat noisy CVT.
