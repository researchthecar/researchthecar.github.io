The 2023 Subaru Crosstrek is a popular subcompact SUV known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and practicality. It offers two engine options: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine available on the Sport and Limited trims, delivering 182 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque. The base and Premium trims are available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission), while the Sport and Limited trims are exclusively equipped with the CVT. People often praise the Crosstrek for its off-road capability, comfortable ride, and ample cargo space for its class. Some criticisms include the base engine's lack of power and the sometimes noisy CVT transmission.
