The 2016 Subaru Crosstrek is a compact crossover known for its standard all-wheel drive, fuel efficiency, and off-road capability. It's powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder Boxer engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its reliability, safety features, and practicality, while common complaints include the engine's lack of power, especially when fully loaded or driving uphill, and the relatively small cargo space.

**Engine**

**2.0L Four-Cylinder Boxer Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. The issue may manifest as a noticeable drop in the oil level on the dipstick, potentially leading to engine damage if left unaddressed. Some owners report adding a quart every 1,000 - 2,000 miles.
    *   Solution: Subaru issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) addressing this issue. The fix might involve replacing the piston rings with an updated design to improve oil sealing. In some cases, a short block replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and required repairs)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Spring Recall**
    * Description/Symptoms: A potential defect in the valve springs can lead to engine malfunction or stalling.
    * Solution: Replace the valve springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Recall repair, no cost to owner.
    * Recalls: Recall Number J37. This is for vehicles manufactured between February 16, 2016, and May 13, 2016.

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the CVT valve body, which can cause hesitation, jerking, or slipping during acceleration. This may also trigger the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body can resolve the issue. In some cases, a full CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Chain Stretching or Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT chain, responsible for transmitting power, can stretch or fail over time, leading to transmission slippage, noise, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: CVT replacement is usually the only reliable fix for a stretched or failed chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (CVT replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature rear wheel bearing failure can lead to a grinding or humming noise coming from the rear of the vehicle, especially at higher speeds. There could also be excessive play in the wheel.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty wheel bearing is the recommended solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (per wheel bearing)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, particularly when the vehicle is left parked for extended periods. This can result in a dead battery and the inability to start the car.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing parasitic draws on the electrical system is key. This can involve checking for faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or malfunctioning modules. Replacing the battery may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may affect audio, navigation, and other integrated features.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or updating the infotainment software can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, replacing the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $1,000+ (for head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the windshield is prone to cracking easily, even from small impacts.
    *   Solution: Windshield replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In vehicles exposed to prolonged sunlight and high temperatures, the dashboard can develop cracks.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or use of a dashboard cover to protect the dash from the sun.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the severity and repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor can fail, resulting in no airflow from the vents. This can impact heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.
    * Solution: Replacing the blower motor is the solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2016 Subaru Crosstrek, while generally reliable, can suffer from several issues. The most concerning are related to the engine's oil consumption and the CVT transmission's reliability, which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, particularly battery drain and infotainment glitches, are also relatively common. Other issues such as suspension and interior defects are not as prevalent but should be considered. The overall severity of potential problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
