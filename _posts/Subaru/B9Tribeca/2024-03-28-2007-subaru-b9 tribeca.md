**Introducing the 2007 Subaru B9 Tribeca**

The 2007 Subaru B9 Tribeca is a mid-size SUV offered with two engine options: a 3.0-liter H6 and a 3.6-liter H6. Transmission options include a 5-speed automatic (for the 3.0-liter engine) and a 5-speed automatic with manual mode (for the 3.6-liter engine). The 3.0-liter engine produces 245 horsepower and 226 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.6-liter engine produces 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque.
