The 2007 Subaru B9 Tribeca was Subaru's foray into the mid-size SUV market. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.0-liter horizontally opposed (flat) six-cylinder engine, producing 245 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Tribeca for its comfortable ride, standard all-wheel drive, and spacious interior. Criticisms frequently revolve around the polarizing exterior styling, fuel economy, and some reliability concerns.
