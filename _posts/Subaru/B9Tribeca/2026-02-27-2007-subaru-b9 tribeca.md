### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Subaru B9 Tribeca, while offering Subaru's signature AWD, presents a mixed reliability picture. The 3.0L engine can experience coolant leaks and VVT issues, while the automatic transmission may develop shifting problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and headlight condensation, can be frustrating. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling are common for vehicles of this age. Interior climate control can be affected by blend door actuator failures. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in repair costs.
