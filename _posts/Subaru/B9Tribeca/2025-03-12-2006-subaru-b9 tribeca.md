The 2006 Subaru B9 Tribeca marked Subaru's entry into the mid-size SUV market. It came with a 3.0-liter H6 engine producing 250 horsepower and 219 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Many people found the Tribeca's distinctive (and somewhat controversial) styling to be a plus, along with its standard all-wheel drive and spacious interior. On the other hand, the B9 Tribeca received criticism for its fuel economy, cramped third-row seating, and somewhat polarizing exterior design, especially in the front.
