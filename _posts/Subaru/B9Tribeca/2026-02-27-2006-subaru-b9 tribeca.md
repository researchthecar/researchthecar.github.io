It was powered by a 3.0L H6 engine, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While generally praised for its handling and unique styling, like many first-generation models, it encountered some specific reliability concerns that potential buyers should be aware of. These issues primarily centered around the engine and certain electrical components, though the overall platform demonstrated a reasonable level of durability for its class and era. Regular maintenance is crucial for mitigating potential problems.
