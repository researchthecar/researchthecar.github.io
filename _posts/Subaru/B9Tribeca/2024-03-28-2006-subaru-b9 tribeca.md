**Introduction:**

The 2006 Subaru B9 Tribeca was a mid-size SUV that offered a choice of two engine options and two transmission options. The 3.0-liter H6 engine produced 245 horsepower and 215 pound-feet of torque, while the 3.6-liter H6 engine produced 256 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of torque. Both engines were mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission.

Owners praised the Tribeca's roomy interior, comfortable ride, and standard all-wheel drive. However, some complained about its sluggish performance and poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.0-liter H6 Engine**

* **Head gasket failure:** This is a common issue with the 3.0-liter H6 engine. Symptoms include overheating, coolant leaks, and white smoke from the exhaust. The solution is to replace the head gaskets. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the engine's valves and pistons. If it fails, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. The timing belt should be replaced every 105,000 miles. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**3.6-liter H6 Engine**

* **Valve spring failure:** This issue affects the 2008-2011 model years. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine and reduced power. The solution is to replace the valve springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission shudder:** This issue can occur when the transmission is shifting gears. Symptoms include a vibration or shuddering sensation. The solution is to replace the transmission fluid and filter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Transmission slipping:** This issue can occur when the transmission is unable to engage gear properly. Symptoms include difficulty accelerating or shifting gears. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** The struts are responsible for supporting the vehicle's weight and absorbing road impacts. If they fail, they can cause the vehicle to ride rough or handle poorly. The solution is to replace the struts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per axle
* **Control arm failure:** The control arms are responsible for connecting the wheels to the suspension. If they fail, they can cause the vehicle to wander or pull to one side. The solution is to replace the control arms. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per side

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator is responsible for charging the battery. If it fails, the battery will not be able to hold a charge and the vehicle will eventually stall. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Starter failure:** The starter is responsible for starting the engine. If it fails, the vehicle will not start. The solution is to replace the starter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
