Many owners appreciate the WRX's performance and handling, but some common complaints include a rough ride, interior quality, and potential reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This is a common complaint across many model years of WRX. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil more often than usual.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and using a higher viscosity oil can help. A more permanent fix may involve replacing the piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knock/Detonation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine knocking or pinging, especially under heavy acceleration, can indicate pre-ignition or detonation. This is often due to poor fuel quality or issues with the engine's tuning.
    *   Solution: Using premium fuel (91 octane or higher) and ensuring the engine is properly tuned can help. In some cases, a professional engine inspection and repair may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Control Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The purge control valve, part of the evaporative emissions system, can fail. This can cause a check engine light and potentially affect engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty purge control valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Grinding During Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, especially into 1st or 2nd, accompanied by a grinding noise. This can be caused by worn synchronizers.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn synchronizers or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report jerky acceleration or hesitation, especially at low speeds. This can be due to the CVT's programming or issues with the transmission's control system.
    *   Solution: A CVT software update from the dealership may help. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $6,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Premature Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete CVT failure requiring replacement.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty CVT Transmission
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Excessive Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling sounds coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn struts, bushings, or sway bar end links.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the components needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Head Unit Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or failure to connect to devices.
    *   Solution: Updating the head unit's software or replacing the unit if necessary.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found
