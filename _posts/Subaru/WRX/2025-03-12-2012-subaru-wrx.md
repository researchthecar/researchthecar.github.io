The 2012 Subaru WRX is a performance-oriented compact car known for its turbocharged engine, symmetrical all-wheel drive, and engaging driving experience. The 2012 WRX is equipped with a 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 265 horsepower and 244 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many enthusiasts appreciate the WRX for its sporty handling, strong acceleration, and practicality. However, common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, a somewhat stiff ride, and potential reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report that their 2012 WRX burns through oil at a higher-than-normal rate, sometimes requiring top-offs between oil changes. The car may exhibit blue smoke from the exhaust, indicating oil burning.
    *   Solution: Performing an oil consumption test to determine the rate of consumption. If it is above the manufacturer's acceptable level, piston ring replacement might be required. Valve seals can also contribute to the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining or screeching noises from the turbocharger, and potentially a check engine light. Turbocharger failure can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. Inspecting oil lines and intercooler for debris to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks (internal or external), white smoke from the exhaust, and coolant mixing with oil. This is a common issue on earlier Subaru models, including the 2012 WRX.
    *   Solution: Replacing the head gaskets. Machining the cylinder heads to ensure a flat sealing surface is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, difficulty shifting gears, a high clutch engagement point, and unusual noises during clutch operation. This is often due to wear and tear, especially with aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing. It is often recommended to resurface or replace the flywheel as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly 2nd and 3rd. This indicates wear on the synchronizers within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the transmission. Replacing the affected synchronizers, bearings, and seals is required during a rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, especially when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear end of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. This affects handling and ride quality.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear struts and/or springs. Upgrading to stiffer aftermarket springs can also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, rough idling, and potential loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor. Diagnosing the root cause of the failure (e.g., exhaust leaks, sensor contamination) is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found
