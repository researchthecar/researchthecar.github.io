The 2014 Subaru WRX is a performance-oriented compact car known for its turbocharged engine, all-wheel drive, and sporty handling.

Owners often praise the WRX for its engaging driving experience, practicality, and all-weather capability. Common dislikes include a somewhat stiff ride, road noise, and the relatively high cost of maintenance and repairs.
