The 2024 Subaru WRX is a performance-oriented compact car known for its rally-inspired roots and turbocharged engine. It is powered by a 2.4-liter turbocharged Boxer engine producing 271 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a Subaru Performance Transmission (SPT), which is a continuously variable transmission (CVT) with simulated gear ratios. Owners appreciate the WRX for its engaging driving experience, standard all-wheel drive, and relatively affordable price point for the performance it offers. Common dislikes include the somewhat stiff ride, perceived lack of refinement in the interior, and the styling, which can be polarizing.
