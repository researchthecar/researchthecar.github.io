### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Subaru WRX is generally a reliable performance car, particularly in its manual transmission variants. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, specifically the turbocharger and potential oil consumption on the 2.0L engine. For manual transmissions, clutch wear is a typical concern for high-mileage or aggressively driven vehicles. CVT models can experience some hesitation or fluid-related issues. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread, significant reliability concerns, indicating good overall build quality in these areas. Regular maintenance and attentive driving habits are key to mitigating potential powertrain issues.
