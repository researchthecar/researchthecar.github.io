The 2015 Subaru WRX marked a significant redesign for the popular sports sedan. It came equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder FA20F engine, producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and a Sport Lineartronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the WRX for its engaging driving dynamics, powerful engine, and standard all-wheel drive. However, common complaints revolve around the CVT's performance and reliability, interior quality, and some engine-related issues.
