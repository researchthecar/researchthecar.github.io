### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Subaru WRX, particularly with the 2.0L turbocharged engine, presents a mixed reliability profile. While the chassis, suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components generally hold up well with no widespread reported issues, the powertrain is where most concerns lie. Both the manual and CVT transmissions can experience issues, ranging from clutch wear and grinding in the manual to fluid leaks and shuddering in the CVT. The 2.0L engine itself has seen reports of turbocharger failures, coolant leaks, and valve spring problems. Owners should be particularly vigilant about maintenance and listen for any unusual noises or performance changes, especially concerning the engine and transmission. Addressing potential issues early can mitigate more significant and costly repairs down the line.
