The 2019 Subaru WRX is a popular sports sedan known for its turbocharged engine, standard all-wheel drive, and engaging driving experience. The engine option available is a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-four (boxer) engine, producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the WRX for its performance, handling, and practicality, but common complaints include a somewhat stiff ride, interior quality, and potential reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible exhaust smoke, and the need to add oil every few hundred miles.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Subaru has performed oil consumption tests and, if deemed excessive, may replace the piston rings and short block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the extent of the repair, but can range from $2,000 - $7,000+ for a short block replacement.

*   **Knocking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of engine knocking or pinging, particularly under acceleration. This can be a sign of pre-detonation and potentially damaging to the engine.
    *   Solution: Using higher octane fuel (premium) can sometimes mitigate the issue. In more severe cases, a professional diagnosis and possible repair of the engine's internals may be necessary. Some owners have had success with ECU tuning to address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis $100 - $200. Repairs can range from ECU tuning ($500+) to engine rebuild ($5,000+).

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The purge valve controls fuel vapor flow to the engine. If the valve fails it will cause a check engine light with code P044E
    *   Solution: Replace the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

* **Air/Fuel Ratio Issues**
   * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, and decreased fuel economy. A check engine light may illuminate, potentially indicating issues with the mass airflow sensor (MAF) or oxygen sensors.
   * Solution: Diagnosis by a mechanic is essential to identify the root cause. Replacement of faulty sensors, cleaning the MAF sensor, or addressing vacuum leaks are potential fixes.
   * Estimated Cost to Fix: Sensor replacement can range from $200-$500, depending on the specific sensor and labor costs. Vacuum leak repair can vary based on the location and complexity.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Grinding During Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially 1st and 2nd, accompanied by a grinding noise. This can indicate worn synchronizers or clutch issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch, synchronizers, or even rebuilding the transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Clutch replacement $1,200 - $2,000+. Transmission rebuild $2,500+.

*   **Throwout Bearing Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A squealing or chirping noise that occurs when the clutch pedal is depressed. This is a common issue related to the throwout bearing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the throwout bearing, which often requires replacing the entire clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+. (Clutch assembly replacement)

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven or jerky acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation or lag when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid changes at shorter intervals than recommended by Subaru can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change $200+. Valve body replacement $1,500+. CVT replacement $5,000+.
Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unusual whirring, whining, or buzzing noises coming from the transmission, particularly during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: This can be a sign of internal CVT damage. Requires a thorough inspection by a qualified technician. In many cases, a CVT replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT replacement $5,000+.

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, particularly when going over bumps. This can indicate worn control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, or strut mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings or entire control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bushing replacement $200 - $500 per corner. Control arm replacement $300 - $700 per corner.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits unused for a few days. Difficulty starting the car, particularly in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Could be due to a parasitic draw or a faulty battery. Diagnose the source of the draw and repair the circuit, or replace the battery if it is no longer holding a charge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement $150 - $300. Parasitic draw diagnosis and repair $100 - $500+.

*   **Head Unit Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (head unit) freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve the issue. In some cases, replacing the head unit is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Head unit replacement $500 - $1,500+.

**Interior**

*   **Rattling and Vibrations**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various rattles and vibrations throughout the cabin, particularly in the dashboard, door panels, and center console.
    *   Solution: Locating and addressing the source of the rattles, often involving adding sound deadening material or tightening loose panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the severity and location of the rattles, but can range from $100 - $500+ to have a professional address them.

No Issues Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Subaru WRX, while known for its performance, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues like oil consumption and knocking can be expensive to repair, but are not universally experienced. Transmission problems, particularly with the CVT, can also be costly. Electrical and suspension issues are less severe but still warrant attention. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect any used 2019 WRX and be aware of these potential problems.
