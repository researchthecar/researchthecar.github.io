### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Subaru WRX offers a compelling performance package, but potential buyers and owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly within the engine and transmission. The 2.0L turbocharged engine, while powerful, has documented instances of turbocharger failure and, more critically, piston ring land issues, which can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission reliability also varies; the manual gearbox can experience clutch wear and synchronizer problems, while the CVT is susceptible to fluid leaks and, in some cases, complete unit failure. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components generally do not present widespread issues beyond normal wear and tear. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning oil levels and driving habits, is crucial for mitigating engine-related problems.
