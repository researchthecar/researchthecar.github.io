The 2021 Subaru WRX is a performance-oriented sedan known for its turbocharged engine and standard all-wheel drive. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many enthusiasts appreciate the WRX for its engaging driving dynamics, responsive handling, and practicality. However, some common criticisms include the relatively harsh ride, dated interior design, and noticeable road noise.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights and the need to add oil regularly.
    *   Solution: Some dealerships may perform an oil consumption test and potentially replace piston rings or the short block if consumption exceeds acceptable limits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly; from several hundred dollars for minor repairs to $5,000+ for short block replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the engine idling roughly or hesitating during acceleration, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Could be due to faulty MAF sensor, spark plugs, or vacuum leak. A diagnostic scan can pinpoint the cause. Replacing spark plugs or cleaning the MAF sensor may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the repair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Grinding or Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced grinding noises or difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly 1st and 2nd.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by worn synchros, low transmission fluid, or a faulty clutch. Replacing the synchros or clutch assembly may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifting behavior, especially during acceleration and deceleration. This can be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change may improve shifting smoothness. In more severe cases, the CVT valve body may need to be replaced or the entire transmission replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 for fluid change, $1,500 - $6,000+ for valve body or transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Noises from Front Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises coming from the front suspension when turning or going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by worn sway bar end links or lower control arm bushings. Replacing these components is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealership may resolve the issue. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update, $500 - $1,500+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure, dead battery, requires frequent jump starts.
    * Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test. Common fixes are replacing the battery or adding a battery tender.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Dealerships or owners may attempt to locate and isolate the source of the rattle by adding padding or tightening loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies; can range from minor adjustments to several hundred dollars if professional help is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2021 Subaru WRX exhibits some common issues, with the most notable concerning potential oil consumption in the engine and shifting issues in both the manual and CVT transmissions. Electrical gremlins, specifically infotainment glitches, and suspension noises are also reported. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission replacements, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
