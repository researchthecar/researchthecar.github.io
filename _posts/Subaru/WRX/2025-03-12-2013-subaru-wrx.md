*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between changes. Symptoms include low oil levels, oil light illumination, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Regularly monitor oil levels and top off as needed. If consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the cause. Potential fixes include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings, or in severe cases, an engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Cracked Ringland**
