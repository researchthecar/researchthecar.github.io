### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Subaru WRX presents a generally solid reliability record, especially considering its performance-oriented nature. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the powertrain, specifically potential oil consumption in the 2.4L turbo engine and some transmission-related issues for both manual and CVT options, such as clutch engagement or hesitation. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are also noted but often resolvable with software updates. Suspension, exterior, and interior components have shown good durability. Owners should be diligent with regular maintenance, particularly oil level checks, and be aware of potential transmission quirks, especially under demanding use.
