The 2017 Subaru WRX is a popular performance sedan known for its turbocharged engine, standard all-wheel drive, and sporty handling. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a six-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the WRX's performance and all-weather capability. Common dislikes include a somewhat harsh ride, road noise, and the relatively basic interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil level warning light or noticeable burning of oil.
    *   Solution: The issue is commonly resolved by short block replacement with an updated piston ring design to mitigate oil entering the cylinders.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intercooler Condensation/Knock**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In cold weather, condensation can build up in the top mount intercooler. Upon acceleration, this condensation can enter the engine and cause a noticeable knock or stumble.
    *   Solution: Some owners install an aftermarket intercooler drain or modify the existing one to allow condensation to escape.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Control Solenoid Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The purge control solenoid valve may fail, leading to a check engine light and potential issues with fuel vapor management.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty purge control solenoid valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Grinding or Difficulty Shifting into Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported difficulty engaging gears, particularly 1st and 2nd, and/or grinding noises during shifts. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: This can be due to worn synchros, a worn shift fork, or issues with the clutch. Replacement of the affected components is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky or Hesitant Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced a jerky or hesitant feeling during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be attributed to the CVT's programming or internal components.
    *   Solution: Software updates or CVT fluid changes may alleviate the issue. In severe cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for fluid change) - $6,000+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Clunking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A clunking noise emanating from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: This can be due to worn or loose sway bar end links, bushings, or other suspension components. Replacement of the affected parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Head Unit Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory head unit may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: A software update or replacement of the head unit may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems connecting to Bluetooth devices, including dropped connections or failure to pair.
    *   Solution: This often requires head unit software updates or, in some cases, head unit replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattle**
    * Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise coming from the sunroof assembly, especially when driving on rough roads.
    * Solution: Tightening the sunroof assembly or applying lubricant.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2017 Subaru WRX has several potential issues. The most significant ones are related to the engine (oil consumption) and the CVT transmission (jerky acceleration), which could lead to expensive repairs. Other issues, such as suspension noises and electrical problems, are less severe but can still be bothersome. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the car inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase.
