### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Subaru WRX presents a mixed reliability picture. While the chassis, suspension, and most interior/exterior components appear solid, the new 2.4L turbocharged engine and its associated transmissions (both manual and CVT) have shown some concerning trends. Issues like engine knock, oil consumption, and transmission hesitation or overheating are the primary areas of concern. These can lead to significant repair costs if not addressed promptly. Owners who prioritize performance and driving dynamics may find the WRX appealing, but should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance and repair needs compared to previous generations or less performance-oriented Subaru models. Regular and thorough maintenance, especially concerning the powertrain, is highly recommended.
