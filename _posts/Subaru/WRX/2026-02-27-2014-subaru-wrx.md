### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Subaru WRX offers a thrilling driving experience, but its performance-oriented nature means certain components, particularly the engine and transmission, can be prone to issues if not maintained diligently or if subjected to aggressive driving. The 2.5L turbocharged engine has documented concerns with piston ring lands and head gaskets, which can be costly to repair. Both manual transmission options can experience accelerated clutch wear and, in the case of the 6-speed, potential input shaft bearing issues. Other categories like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior show no widespread significant reliability concerns beyond typical wear and tear. Prospective buyers should prioritize vehicles with a comprehensive maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection, especially for the engine and drivetrain.
