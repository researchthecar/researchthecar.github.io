### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Subaru WRX, particularly with the 2.0L turbocharged engine, presents a generally solid reliability record for a performance vehicle. The most commonly cited concerns revolve around potential oil consumption and turbocharger health, which are not uncommon in high-performance applications and often manageable with diligent maintenance and early detection. Manual transmissions are robust, though clutch wear is a factor of driving style. The CVT, while offering convenience, has seen some reports of fluid leaks and occasional drivability quirks. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread, significant issues. Regular maintenance, especially fluid checks and changes, is crucial for maximizing the longevity of the WRX's performance-oriented components.
