The 2016 Subaru WRX is a popular sport compact car known for its turbocharged engine, standard all-wheel drive, and engaging driving experience. It came equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners appreciate the WRX for its performance, handling, and practicality, but some common complaints include the stiff ride, road noise, and occasional reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some 2016 WRX owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and visible exhaust smoke in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Addressing this issue can involve a few steps, starting with confirming oil consumption through a consumption test performed by a Subaru dealer. If consumption exceeds Subaru's specified limit, potential solutions include replacing the piston rings or, in some cases, the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+ depending on the solution and if it is under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knocking/Pinging Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience knocking or pinging noises from the engine, particularly under acceleration. This can be related to the engine management system, fuel quality, or carbon buildup.
    *   Solution: Start with using premium fuel (91 octane or higher). A Subaru dealer may perform a diagnostic scan to check for any error codes. A carbon cleaning service may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature turbocharger failure can occur, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine, and potentially exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Grinding During Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported grinding noises during shifts, particularly into 2nd or 3rd gear. This could indicate worn synchros.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected synchros or rebuilding the transmission is often necessary. Some owners have had luck with changing the transmission fluid to a higher quality synthetic fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$150 for new fluid, $1,500 - $3,000+ for synchro replacement or rebuild.
