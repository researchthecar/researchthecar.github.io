The 2012 Subaru Tribeca is a mid-size crossover SUV that offered a blend of practicality and a unique design. For 2012, it came with a single engine option, the 3.6-liter H6 engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Tribeca's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and standard all-wheel drive. However, some criticisms included its polarizing styling (especially the earlier years), limited cargo space compared to rivals, and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.6L H6**
* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations on the engine, including valve cover gaskets, timing chain cover, and the front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the typical fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the location of the leak and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Head Gasket Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and/or coolant mixing with the oil.
