### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Subaru Tribeca presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.6L engine, while generally robust, can be prone to oil and coolant leaks due to aging seals and gaskets. The 5-speed automatic transmission may exhibit issues with harsh shifting or delayed engagement, often requiring fluid services or more extensive repairs. Suspension components like control arm bushings are common wear items that can lead to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as failing power window motors and infotainment glitches, are also reported. Exterior issues like rear hatch seal leaks and interior problems with the HVAC blower motor are notable. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
