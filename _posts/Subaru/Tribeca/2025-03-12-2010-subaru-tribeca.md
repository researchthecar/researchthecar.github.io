The 2010 Subaru Tribeca is a mid-size crossover SUV that was offered with a single engine option: a 3.6-liter H6 engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Tribeca for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and standard all-wheel drive. Criticisms commonly include its distinctive (and often disliked) exterior styling, relatively poor fuel economy, and somewhat dated technology compared to competitors.

**Summary**

The 2010 Subaru Tribeca, while appreciated for its comfort and AWD, faces several common issues. Engine oil leaks and catalytic converter failures are the most concerning engine-related problems. The 5-speed automatic transmission can suffer from torque converter problems. Suspension issues, like wheel bearing and strut mount failures, can also arise. Electrical issues include battery drain and power window motor failure. The costs to address these issues can vary widely, from a few hundred dollars to over a thousand, depending on the specific problem and the extent of the repair. While not every 2010 Tribeca will experience all of these problems, being aware of them can help potential buyers make informed decisions.
