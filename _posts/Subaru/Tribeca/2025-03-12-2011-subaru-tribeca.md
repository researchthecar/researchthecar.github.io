The 2011 Subaru Tribeca is a mid-size SUV that was offered with only one engine option: a 3.6-liter horizontally opposed (boxer) six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. It was paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Tribeca's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and standard all-wheel drive. Criticisms frequently cited its polarizing styling, limited cargo space compared to competitors, and relatively poor fuel economy.
