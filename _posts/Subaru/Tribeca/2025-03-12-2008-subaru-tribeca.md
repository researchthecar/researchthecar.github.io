The 2008 Subaru Tribeca is a mid-size crossover SUV that aimed to provide a blend of Subaru's renowned all-wheel-drive capability with a more upscale interior and styling. The 2008 Tribeca was only offered with one engine option, a 3.6-liter H6 engine that produced 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Tribeca's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and standard all-wheel drive. Common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, some polarizing exterior styling choices, and a relatively small third-row seat.

**Summary**
The 2008 Subaru Tribeca has a range of potential issues, with engine oil leaks and head gasket failures being among the most concerning due to their potential for high repair costs. Suspension issues like wheel bearing and control arm bushing wear are also common. Electrical gremlins can be difficult and costly to diagnose and repair. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more severe and lead to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a trusted mechanic to assess the overall condition of the vehicle and identify any existing or potential problems.
