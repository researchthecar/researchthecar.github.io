The 2009 Subaru Tribeca is a mid-size crossover SUV known for its distinctive styling (though controversial) and Subaru's signature all-wheel-drive system. It came with only one engine option: a 3.6-liter horizontally opposed (flat or "boxer") six-cylinder engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Tribeca's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and standard all-wheel drive, making it capable in various weather conditions. However, some common complaints include the relatively poor fuel economy, polarizing exterior design, and higher repair costs compared to other vehicles in its class.

**Summary**

The 2009 Subaru Tribeca, while offering Subaru's signature all-wheel-drive and a relatively comfortable ride, is prone to several issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine-related problems, such as oil leaks and timing chain tensioner failures, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also lead to significant expenses. Other common problems include suspension component wear, electrical issues, and some interior component failures. Before purchasing a 2009 Tribeca, a thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended to assess the condition of these potentially problematic areas. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the cost of repairs can vary accordingly, potentially making ownership more expensive than other vehicles in its class.
