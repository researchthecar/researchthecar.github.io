The 2013 Subaru Tribeca is a mid-size SUV that was offered with a single engine option, a 3.6-liter flat-six engine producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Tribeca for its comfortable ride, standard all-wheel drive, and available third-row seating. However, common complaints included its polarizing styling, relatively poor fuel economy for its class, and the limited cargo space when the third row was in use.

**Summary**

The 2013 Subaru Tribeca, while appreciated for its ride and standard AWD, has some potential issues to be aware of. Engine oil leaks and potential head gasket failures are the most serious concerns, with repairs potentially costing several thousand dollars. Transmission torque converter issues and suspension wear (rear wheel bearings) can also lead to significant repair bills. Electrical gremlins, like battery drain, and interior HVAC issues, such as blend door actuator failure, represent less costly but still inconvenient repairs. Overall, prospective buyers should have the vehicle thoroughly inspected, paying close attention to potential oil leaks, engine performance, and suspension noise.
