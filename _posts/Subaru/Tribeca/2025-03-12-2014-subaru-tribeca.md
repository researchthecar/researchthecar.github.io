**Engine**

**3.6L H6**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, timing chain cover, and the oil cooler. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the source of the leak

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Subaru 3.6L H6 engine is known for head gasket failures. Symptoms include overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and bubbling in the coolant overflow tank.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the head gaskets, machining of the cylinder heads, and potentially replacing other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the torque converter, leading to shuddering or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the repair needed.
*   **Slipping or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is where the transmission feels like it is taking a long time to switch gears or the engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed. It can also make a thud noise.
    *   Solution: It is necessary to have a mechanic check the transmission. Usually, the fix is a rebuilt or replacement transmission
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000+

**Suspension**

    * Description/Symptoms: Bushings in the control arms and sway bar links can wear out, leading to clunking noises, especially over bumps, and reduced handling precision.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn bushings. In some cases, replacing the entire control arm or sway bar link may be more cost-effective.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can be an issue, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
