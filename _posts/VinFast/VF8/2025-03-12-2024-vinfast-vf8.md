The 2024 VinFast VF 8 is an all-electric SUV marking VinFast's entry into the North American market. Available in Eco and Plus trims, the VF 8 features a dual-motor all-wheel drive setup in both variants. The Eco trim produces 349 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, while the Plus trim bumps those figures up to 402 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque.

However, concerns have been raised about software glitches, ride quality, and range accuracy.
