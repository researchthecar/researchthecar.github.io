The 2024 VinFast VF 9 is an all-electric, three-row SUV positioned as a premium offering in the EV market. Power comes from a dual-motor setup providing all-wheel drive. There is only one motor option, a dual motor configuration producing 402 horsepower and 472 lb-ft of torque. Early adopters and reviews highlight the VF 9's spacious interior, distinctive styling, and competitive pricing (before incentives). However, concerns have been raised about the vehicle's software, range accuracy, and overall build quality. As a relatively new entrant, the VF 9 is still undergoing real-world testing, and owner feedback is crucial for identifying common issues.
