The 2018 Buick Enclave Avenir represents the top-tier trim level of Buick's popular three-row SUV, offering a luxurious experience with upgraded materials, styling, and features. While the Avenir trim shares its mechanical underpinnings with other Enclave models, certain issues are more commonly reported by owners. All 2018 Enclaves come equipped with a 3.6L V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Enclave Avenir for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and quiet cabin. Common dislikes include the infotainment system's responsiveness, some cheap interior materials for the price point, and the vehicle's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6 (LGY)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption between oil changes. The engine may require adding oil more frequently than expected, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage if not monitored.
    * Solution: The oil consumption should be checked at the dealer. Some have had success with software updates to the ECM (Engine Control Module). Other repairs can include replacing valve cover gaskets, piston rings, or even the engine in extreme cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L V6 is known for potential timing chain issues. Symptoms include a rattling noise upon starting, especially when cold, a check engine light, and potential misfires. Neglecting this issue can lead to severe engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners. It's recommended to replace the water pump as well, as it's located behind the timing cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during lower gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration and deceleration.
    * Solution: First, check and replace the transmission fluid. If the problem persists, a software update to the TCM (Transmission Control Module) might be needed. In some cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hesitation/Delay in Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay when shifting gears, especially when accelerating from a stop or during highway merging.
    * Solution: Diagnostics to check for transmission codes are the first step. A software update or replacement of the valve body might be required. In severe cases, transmission replacement could be needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can result in difficulty starting the car.
    * Solution: Diagnostics to identify the parasitic draw. Possible causes include a faulty module, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery. Replacing the battery or addressing the parasitic draw are the common solutions.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

* **Backup Camera Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera. The screen may show a black screen, distorted image, or no image at all.
    * Solution: Check the camera wiring and connections. If the wiring is good, the camera itself may need replacement.
