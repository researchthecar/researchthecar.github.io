The 2008 Buick Lucerne is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Engine options for the 2008 model year include the 3.8L Series III V6 engine producing 197 horsepower and 227 lb-ft of torque, and the 4.6L Northstar V8 engine producing 275 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Lucerne's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and large trunk. Common complaints include the somewhat dated styling, less-than-sporty handling, and the 4-speed automatic transmission feeling less refined compared to more modern transmissions with more gears.

**Engine**

**3.8L Series III V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, coolant loss, and possible overheating. This is due to the plastic intake manifold gaskets degrading over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets with updated aluminum-framed gaskets.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant elbows leaking**

**Summary**

The 2008 Buick Lucerne, while comfortable, is prone to some common issues. Engine issues, particularly head gasket failure on the Northstar V8 and intake manifold gasket issues on the V6, can be costly. Transmission problems with the 4T65E are also relatively common. Suspension and electrical issues can add to the ownership costs. Severity of these issues range from minor to major, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the problem and the engine option. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection done to check for these common problems.
