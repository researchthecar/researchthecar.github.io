The 2010 Buick Lucerne is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It offered three engine options: a 3.9L V6 (169 hp and 237 lb-ft of torque), a 3.8L V6 (197 hp and 227 lb-ft of torque), and a 4.6L Northstar V8 (292 hp and 288 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the Lucerne for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and straightforward controls. Common criticisms include its somewhat bland styling, dated transmission, and less-than-stellar fuel economy.
