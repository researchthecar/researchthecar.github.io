### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Buick Lucerne generally presents a reasonable reliability record for its segment. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the engine, particularly intake manifold gasket leaks and EGR valve problems, especially with the 3.8L and 3.9L V6 engines. Transmission concerns, such as torque converter and solenoid pack issues, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, like BCM malfunctions and alternator failures, can occur. While suspension components like strut mounts and air springs (if equipped) may require attention, the exterior and interior generally hold up well. Owners should be aware of these potential problem areas and factor them into maintenance considerations.
