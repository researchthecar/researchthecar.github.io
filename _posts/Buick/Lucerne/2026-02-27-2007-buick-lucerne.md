### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Buick Lucerne generally presents as a reliable vehicle, particularly with the more common 3.8L V6 engine. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with intake manifold gaskets and EGR valves on this engine. The 4.6L V8, while offering more power, carries a higher risk of more expensive coolant leaks related to head gaskets. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4-speed automatic, can include torque converter shudder and solenoid problems. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and premature alternator failure are also noted concerns. Suspension components like strut mounts and optional rear air suspension can require attention. Overall, with proactive maintenance and awareness of these common issues, the Lucerne can provide dependable service.
