The 2011 Buick Lucerne is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and quiet cabin. Engine options included a 3.9L V6 (173 hp, 237 lb-ft of torque) and a 4.6L Northstar V8 (292 hp, 288 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Lucerne for its smooth ride and ease of driving, but some disliked the dated interior and fuel economy, especially with the V8.
