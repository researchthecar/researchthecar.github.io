The 2021 Buick Encore GX is a subcompact SUV offering a balance of style, fuel efficiency, and technology. It came with two engine options: a 1.2L Turbocharged Inline-3 producing 137 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque and a 1.3L Turbocharged Inline-3 generating 155 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. The 1.2L engine is paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive. The 1.3L engine comes standard with the CVT when equipped with front-wheel drive, but the all-wheel-drive models receive a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Encore GX for its comfortable ride, user-friendly infotainment system, and nimble handling. Criticisms frequently include the somewhat underwhelming acceleration, especially with the base engine, and the relatively small cargo space compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2021 Buick Encore GX appears to have a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. The most concerning problems are related to the engine (excessive vibration, oil consumption) and transmission (hesitation, harsh shifting) which could lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues, such as infotainment glitches, are more of a nuisance but can still be frustrating. The sunroof leak is a recurring issue and could cause water damage if left unaddressed. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these symptoms and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic. While the Encore GX offers many appealing features, awareness of these potential problems is crucial for a satisfying ownership experience.
