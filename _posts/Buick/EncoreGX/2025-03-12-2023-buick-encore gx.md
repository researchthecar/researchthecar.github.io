The 2023 Buick Encore GX is a subcompact SUV that offers a blend of practicality and style. Engine options include a 1.2L Turbo I3 producing 137 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3L Turbo I3 producing 155 hp and 174 lb-ft of torque. The 1.2L engine is exclusively paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive, while the 1.3L engine comes standard with the CVT and front-wheel drive, but is optionally paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. Drivers generally appreciate its comfortable ride, user-friendly technology, and fuel efficiency. Some common complaints revolve around the engine's somewhat sluggish acceleration, particularly with the base 1.2L engine, and the occasionally unrefined nature of the CVT.
