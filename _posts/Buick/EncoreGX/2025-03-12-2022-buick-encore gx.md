The 2022 Buick Encore GX is a subcompact SUV that offers a blend of practicality and upscale features. It comes with two engine options: a 1.2L turbocharged inline-3 producing 137 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.3L turbocharged inline-3 delivering 155 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. The 1.2L engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and front-wheel drive, while the 1.3L engine can be had with either front-wheel drive and a CVT or all-wheel drive and a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Encore GX for its spacious cabin, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. Common criticisms include the somewhat underwhelming performance of the base engine and the occasionally quirky behavior of the CVT.

**Summary**

The 2022 Buick Encore GX experiences a range of issues, from minor interior rattles to more significant engine and transmission concerns. Engine misfires, turbocharger wastegate actuator failures, and transmission problems (especially with the CVT) appear to be among the more common and potentially costly issues. Electrical problems, such as infotainment system glitches and backup camera failures, also warrant attention. While some issues can be resolved with software updates or relatively inexpensive repairs, others may require more extensive and costly interventions, like replacing a transmission or infotainment unit. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider obtaining a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's condition.
