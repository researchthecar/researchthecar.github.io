The 2005 Buick Park Avenue is a full-size luxury sedan known for its smooth ride and spacious interior. It was available in two trims: base Park Avenue and the uplevel Park Avenue Ultra. Both trims were equipped with the 3800 Series III 3.8L V6 engine producing 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. The Park Avenue Ultra featured a supercharged version of the 3.8L V6, rated at 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. All models came with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Park Avenue for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and large trunk. Dislikes often included the somewhat dated styling and average fuel economy.
