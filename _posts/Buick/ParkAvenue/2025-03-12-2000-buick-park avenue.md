The 2000 Buick Park Avenue is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. It came standard with a 3.8L Series II V6 engine, producing 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. An upgraded "Ultra" trim was available, featuring a supercharged version of the 3.8L V6, boosting output to 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Park Avenue's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and large trunk. Common complaints include the somewhat dated styling, lower fuel economy compared to smaller cars, and occasional electrical gremlins associated with the age of the vehicle.

**Summary:**

The 2000 Buick Park Avenue is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it is prone to certain issues. Engine problems like intake manifold gasket failures and supercharger coupler issues (on the Ultra trim) are common. Transmission problems, particularly with the pressure control solenoid and torque converter clutch, can be costly. Electrical issues related to the BCM and ignition switch are also relatively frequent. Suspension problems such as air suspension failure on Ultra models will occur with age. Overall, while the Park Avenue offers a comfortable and spacious ride, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in repair costs when considering a purchase. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs.
