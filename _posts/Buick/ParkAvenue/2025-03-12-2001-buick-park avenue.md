**Summary**

The 2001 Buick Park Avenue, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to watch out for. The most significant problems relate to the engine's intake manifold gaskets and the transmission's tendency to develop shifting problems. The air suspension (if equipped) and various electrical components can also be problematic. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor electrical problems to more costly engine and transmission repairs. Addressing these issues promptly can help extend the life of the vehicle.
