### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Buick Park Avenue offers a comfortable and generally reliable ownership experience, particularly with its robust 3800 V6 engines. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and, less frequently, head gasket failures on the V6 engines. The 4T65-E transmission can experience torque converter or solenoid issues. Suspension components like strut mounts and rear air springs (if equipped) may require attention. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure are also noted. Interior climate control blend doors and power seat motors are other areas that may need repair. Despite these points, with proper maintenance and addressing these known issues, the Park Avenue can remain a dependable luxury sedan.
