### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Buick Park Avenue offers a generally comfortable ride, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the 3.8L V6 engines, where intake manifold gaskets and head gaskets can be points of failure. The 4T65-E transmission, while robust for its time, can experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, are also noted.
