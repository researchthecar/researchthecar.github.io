The 2004 Buick Park Avenue is a full-size luxury sedan known for its smooth ride and spacious interior. It comes standard with a 3.8L Series III V6 engine producing 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. A supercharged version of the 3.8L V6 is available, which increases the output to 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 4T65-E 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and large trunk. Some disliked the somewhat dated styling and less-than-sporty handling.

Transmission problems can be significant and costly. Suspension issues, particularly with the air ride system, can also be expensive to repair. Electrical issues with the BCM can cause a variety of problems. While some issues are minor, others can be quite expensive to fix, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing.
