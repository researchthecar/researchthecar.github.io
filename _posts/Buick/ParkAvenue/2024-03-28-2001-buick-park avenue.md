**Introduction**

The 2001 Buick Park Avenue is a full-size luxury sedan that was offered with a choice of two engine options: a 3.8L V6 and a 4.2L V8. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Park Avenue was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engines. However, it was also criticized for its lackluster fuel economy and dated design.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**
