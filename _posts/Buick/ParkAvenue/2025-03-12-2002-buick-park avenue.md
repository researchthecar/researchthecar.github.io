The 2002 Buick Park Avenue is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliable powertrain. The standard engine is the 3.8L Series II V6, producing 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. There was also an available supercharged 3.8L V6 engine which produced 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Park Avenue's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and dependability. However, some common complaints include issues with the electrical system, specifically with the instrument cluster and climate control. Rust in the rocker panels is also a noted issue.

**Engine**

**3.8L Series II V6 (L36)**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, overheating, white smoke from exhaust, engine misfires. The plastic intake manifold gasket is prone to cracking and leaking coolant.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket with an updated design (often using aluminum or improved composite material).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Elbow Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, overheating, low coolant levels. The plastic coolant elbows connecting to the water pump can become brittle and crack, causing coolant loss.
    *   Solution: Replace the plastic coolant elbows with aluminum ones for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Supercharged 3.8L Series II V6 (L67)**

*   **Supercharger Coupler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the supercharger, loss of supercharger boost, decreased engine performance. The supercharger coupler, which connects the supercharger snout to the rotors, can wear out and fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger coupler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, reduced performance, engine knock. The intercooler pump circulates coolant to the intercooler, which cools the air entering the engine after it is compressed by the supercharger. If the pump fails, the engine can overheat, and the air will not be cooled efficiently, resulting in reduced engine performance and/or engine knock.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4T65-E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Pressure Control Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping, erratic shifting, failure to shift into certain gears. The pressure control solenoid regulates the transmission fluid pressure, and if it fails, it can cause various shifting problems.
    *   Solution: Replace the pressure control solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Stalling at idle, shuddering during torque converter lockup, poor fuel economy. The torque converter clutch locks the engine and transmission together at highway speeds for improved fuel economy. If the TCC fails, it can cause various drivability issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Ride Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, rough ride, compressor running constantly or not at all. The air ride suspension uses an air compressor to maintain the correct ride height. If the compressor fails, the rear of the vehicle will sag, and the ride will be rough.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Ride Suspension Air Springs Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, rough ride, compressor running constantly or not at all. The air springs hold air to suspend the vehicle. If the air springs leak, the rear of the vehicle will sag, and the ride will be rough.
    *   Solution: Replace the air springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per spring
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges not working, dim or flickering display, warning lights illuminated or not illuminating. The instrument cluster can experience various electrical issues, leading to inaccurate or non-functional gauges and displays.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. Often, this requires sending the cluster out for professional repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic temperature control, blower motor not working, blend door actuator failure. The climate control system can experience various electrical and mechanical issues, leading to inconsistent or non-functional heating and cooling.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty component (e.g., blower motor resistor, blend door actuator, climate control module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window not operating, slow or jerky window movement, clicking noise from the door. The power window regulator can fail due to wear and tear, causing the window to become inoperable.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rocker Panel Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the rocker panels, especially behind the front and rear wheels. This is a common area for rust to develop due to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the rusted rocker panels. This can involve cutting out the rusted metal and welding in new panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaches from the backing and begins to sag. This is a common issue in older vehicles due to the deterioration of the adhesive.
    *   Solution: Replace the headliner fabric.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Heater Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heater not working, uneven heating, intermittent operation. The seat heater element or control module can fail, causing the seat heater to malfunction.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty component (e.g., seat heater element, control module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Buick Park Avenue is a generally reliable vehicle, but it is prone to certain common issues due to its age. Engine issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and coolant elbow failures are relatively common and can be moderate in cost to repair. Transmission issues can also occur, with the pressure control solenoid being a common failure point. Suspension issues with the air ride system (if equipped) can be expensive to repair. Electrical problems with the instrument cluster and climate control are also common. Rust in the rocker panels is a significant concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected thoroughly before purchasing. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more serious problems that could affect the vehicle's reliability and safety.
