**Introduction:**

The 2004 Buick Park Avenue is a full-size luxury sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine options. It featured a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The 3.8L V6 engine produced 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.8L supercharged V6 delivered 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

Owners appreciate the Park Avenue's classic styling, smooth handling, and abundant cabin space. However, it lacks modern amenities and some models have experienced reliability issues.
