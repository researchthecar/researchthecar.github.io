The 2003 Buick Park Avenue is a full-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and generally reliable powertrain. The standard engine was a 3.8L Series II V6 (L36) producing 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. There was also an "Ultra" trim available, which included the same 3.8L V6 but with a supercharger (L67), increasing output to 240 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the smooth ride, quiet cabin, and comfortable seats of the Park Avenue. Common complaints include the somewhat bland styling and dated interior design, as well as lower fuel economy compared to some newer vehicles.
