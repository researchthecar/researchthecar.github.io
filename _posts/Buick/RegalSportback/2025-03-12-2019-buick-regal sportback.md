The 2019 Buick Regal Sportback is a stylish and practical hatchback that offers a blend of comfort and sporty handling. The Regal Sportback was offered with two engine options: a 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4 producing 250 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 282 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine was paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.6L V6 came with an 8-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Regal Sportback's spacious interior, sleek design, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, occasional drivetrain quirks, and some build quality concerns.

**Summary**

The 2019 Buick Regal Sportback can present a mix of minor and moderate issues. The most concerning problems relate to the 2.0L Turbo engine, specifically excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failures, which can be costly to repair. The 9-speed transmission can also be problematic with harsh shifting. Electrical glitches, like infotainment issues and battery drain, are also common complaints.
