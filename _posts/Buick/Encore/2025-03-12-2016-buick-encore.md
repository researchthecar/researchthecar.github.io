**Summary**

The 2016 Buick Encore, while generally a reliable vehicle, has potential issues with its turbocharged engine, particularly the turbocharger itself and related components like the PCV valve. Transmission issues can also arise. Electrical problems, like battery drain and infotainment glitches, are also present. Suspension components can wear prematurely as well. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (PCV valve replacement) to potentially costly (turbocharger or transmission replacement). Addressing these issues promptly can help prevent further damage and maintain the Encore's reliability.
