The 2017 Buick Encore is a subcompact SUV that offers a blend of maneuverability and comfort, appealing to those who prioritize city driving and ease of parking. Engine options include a 1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4 engine, producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful available 1.4L Turbocharged Inline-4 engine producing 153 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. A common dislike is the somewhat underwhelming performance of the base engine, while owners generally appreciate the upscale interior for its class, the quiet ride, and the available technology features. Both engines were paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission.
