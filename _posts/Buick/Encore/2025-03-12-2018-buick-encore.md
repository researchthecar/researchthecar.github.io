The 2018 Buick Encore is a subcompact SUV known for its maneuverability, comfortable ride, and relatively upscale interior for its class. It generally receives positive marks for ease of parking and fuel efficiency. However, common criticisms include its smaller cargo space, somewhat underwhelming acceleration, and a dated infotainment system. The 2018 Encore is available with a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine in two versions: a standard version producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful version producing 153 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
