Here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2013 Buick Encore, formatted for your website:

The 2013 Buick Encore is a subcompact crossover SUV that marked the beginning of Buick's venture into a smaller, more fuel-efficient segment. While generally liked for its quiet cabin, comfortable ride, and upscale interior for its class, the Encore has faced its share of criticisms, including its somewhat underpowered engine, tight rear seating, and limited cargo space. The 2013 model year came with only one engine and transmission option: a 1.4L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
