The 2014 Buick Encore is a subcompact SUV known for its comfortable ride, upscale interior (for its class), and fuel efficiency. It came standard with a turbocharged 1.4L inline-4 cylinder engine, producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its maneuverability and quiet cabin but often criticize its modest cargo space and acceleration. Some dislike the infotainment system's complexity.
