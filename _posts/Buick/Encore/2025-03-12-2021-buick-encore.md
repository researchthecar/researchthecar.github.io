The 2021 Buick Encore is a subcompact SUV offering a blend of comfort and practicality, appealing to those seeking a smaller, more manageable vehicle. The 2021 Encore came equipped with a 1.4L Turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed automatic transmission was the only option available. Owners often appreciate the Encore's ease of parking, fuel efficiency, and quiet cabin. Some criticisms include its smaller cargo space compared to competitors and somewhat dated infotainment system.
