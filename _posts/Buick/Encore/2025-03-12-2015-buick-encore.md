The 2015 Buick Encore is a compact crossover SUV that offers a blend of fuel efficiency and near-luxury features at an accessible price point. It was offered with only one engine option: a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine, producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Encore's maneuverability, comfortable ride, and relatively quiet cabin. Common criticisms include its limited cargo space, somewhat lackluster acceleration, and the occasional reliability concerns stemming from the turbocharged engine and electrical components.

**Engine**

**1.4L Turbocharged I4 (LUJ/LUV)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling or whining noise from the engine compartment, check engine light illuminated. The turbocharger's bearings can wear prematurely, leading to failure.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, engine misfires, oil leaks, check engine light. The PCV valve can become clogged or fail, leading to pressure buildup in the crankcase.
    *   Solution: Replace the PCV valve. In some cases, the intake manifold may also need to be replaced if the PCV valve is integrated into it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sweet smell of coolant, low coolant level, engine overheating, visible coolant leaks. The water pump, thermostat housing, and coolant hoses are common sources of leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component (water pump, thermostat housing, hoses).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the source of the leak
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T40)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, solenoids, valve body issues, or internal damage. Often requires a transmission flush, or replacement of the affected parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$3,000+ depending on the issue
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or vibrating sensation felt while driving at steady speeds, particularly around 40-60 mph. The torque converter clutch may be failing to lock up properly.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, if that doesn't fix the issue the torque converter should be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll when cornering, uneven tire wear, clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle is slow to start or won't start at all, requiring a jump start. The battery may be draining overnight due to a parasitic draw.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory). Replace the battery if it is damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or glitches. Software glitches or hardware failures can cause these issues.
    *   Solution: Perform a software update, reset the system, or replace the infotainment screen.
