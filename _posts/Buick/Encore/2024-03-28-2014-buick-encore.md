**Introduction to the 2014 Buick Encore**

The 2014 Buick Encore is a subcompact crossover SUV with a stylish design and a comfortable interior. It is available with two engine options: a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 138 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter four-cylinder producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with a six-speed automatic transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Encore received high praise for its fuel efficiency, spacious cabin, and responsive handling. However, it has also been criticized for its lack of power, especially with the 1.4-liter engine.
