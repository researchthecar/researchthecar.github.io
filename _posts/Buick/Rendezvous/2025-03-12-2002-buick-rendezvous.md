The 2002 Buick Rendezvous was a mid-size crossover SUV offering a blend of car-like handling and SUV versatility. It was available with two engine options: a 3.4L LA1 V6 producing 185 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L LY7 V6 added later in its production run. Both engines were paired with a 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often liked the Rendezvous for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available all-wheel drive. Common complaints included issues with the electrical system, specifically the instrument panel, and drivetrain issues relating to the transmission and the all-wheel drive system.
