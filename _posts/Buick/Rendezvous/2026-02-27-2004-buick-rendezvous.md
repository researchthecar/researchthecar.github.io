### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Buick Rendezvous presents a mixed reliability profile. While its comfortable ride and spacious interior are appealing, potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The engines, particularly the 3.6L V6, can experience timing chain problems, and both V6 options are susceptible to intake manifold gasket leaks. Transmission issues, primarily with the 4T65-E automatic, can include torque converter and solenoid failures. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or alternator, are also reported. Suspension components like strut mounts and wheel bearings may require attention. The exterior and interior generally hold up well, with the HVAC blend door actuator being a notable interior component to watch. Proactive maintenance and awareness of these potential repair areas are key for owners of the 2004 Rendezvous.
