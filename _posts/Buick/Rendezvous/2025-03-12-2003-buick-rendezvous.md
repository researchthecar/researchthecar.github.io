Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2003 Buick Rendezvous, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options. The 2003 Buick Rendezvous was GM's first foray into the crossover SUV market. It offered a blend of car-like handling and SUV practicality. People generally liked its comfortable ride and versatile interior space. However, some disliked its somewhat bland styling and perceived lack of power from the standard engine. The 2003 Rendezvous was available with two engine options: a 3.4L LA1 V6 producing 185 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L LY7 V6 producing 255 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque (introduced later in the model year). Both engines were paired with a 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2003 Buick Rendezvous, while offering a comfortable ride and versatility, is prone to certain issues due to its age and design. Engine issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and timing chain problems, particularly in the 3.6L V6, can be relatively costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 4T65E, are also common and can lead to expensive rebuilds or replacements. Suspension and electrical problems can add to the overall ownership costs. While some issues are minor, others can be significant and should be considered when evaluating a used 2003 Buick Rendezvous. It is important to note that because the vehicle is over 20 years old, any repair costs could be higher depending on parts availability and mechanic charges.
