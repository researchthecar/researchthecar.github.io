### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Buick Rendezvous generally presents a mixed reliability profile. The powertrain, particularly the 3.5L and 3.9L V6 engines, can experience issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and, in the case of the 3.9L, VVT actuator problems. The 4-speed automatic transmission is prone to torque converter shudder and occasional slipping. Suspension components such as struts and ball joints may require replacement due to wear. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are also noted. While interior and exterior components are less problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
