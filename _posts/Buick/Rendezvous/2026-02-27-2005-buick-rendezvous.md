### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Buick Rendezvous presents a mixed reliability profile. The powertrain, particularly the 3.6L V6 engine and its timing chain system, can be a source of significant repair costs. Transmission issues, such as torque converter problems, are also noted. Suspension components like strut mounts and wheel bearings may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or power window regulators, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of these common mechanical and electrical concerns and factor potential repair costs into their ownership considerations.
