### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Buick Rendezvous, while offering a comfortable ride, exhibits common issues for its age and platform. The most frequently reported problems lie within the powertrain, specifically with the transmission's torque converter and solenoids, and potential intake manifold gasket leaks or EGR valve issues on the V6 engines. Suspension components like strut mounts and rear springs can also wear out. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior climate control and power window mechanisms are also known to fail. Regular maintenance and addressing these specific potential issues proactively can help maintain the Rendezvous's reliability.
