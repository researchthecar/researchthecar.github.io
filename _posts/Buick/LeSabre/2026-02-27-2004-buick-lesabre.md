### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Buick LeSabre is a generally dependable vehicle, with its robust 3.8L V6 engine being a strong point. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and, less frequently, head gasket failures. Transmission problems, particularly with the torque converter clutch and solenoids, can arise. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are also noted. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling and interior HVAC blend door actuator failures are also documented. Despite these potential concerns, many LeSabres continue to provide reliable service when properly maintained, and the cost of repairs for most common issues is moderate.
