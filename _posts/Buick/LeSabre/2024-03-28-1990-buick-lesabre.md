**Introduction**

The 1990 Buick LeSabre is a full-size luxury sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride quality, and powerful V6 engine. It was available with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The 3.8L V6 engine produced 170 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, while the 5.0L V8 engine generated 180 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a four-speed automatic and a five-speed manual.
