### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Buick LeSabre is a generally reliable vehicle, with its most common issues stemming from the 3.8L V6 engine's intake manifold gaskets and potential head gasket failures, though these are not universal. The transmission, while robust, can experience torque converter or solenoid issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the Body Control Module and alternator, are also noted. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints may require attention over time. Interior issues often involve the HVAC blend door actuators and instrument cluster failures. Despite these potential points of concern, many LeSabres continue to provide dependable service with proper maintenance.
