The 2000 Buick LeSabre is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. The LeSabre was only available with the 3.8L (3800 Series II) V6 engine, which produced 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. It was paired exclusively with the 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the LeSabre's smooth ride, comfortable seats, and quiet cabin. Common complaints include its somewhat bland styling, and dated interior features.
