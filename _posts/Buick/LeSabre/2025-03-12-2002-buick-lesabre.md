The 2002 Buick LeSabre is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. It was offered with only one engine option: the 3.8L Series II V6 engine, producing around 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the LeSabre for its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and overall ease of maintenance. However, some common complaints include issues with the electrical system, specifically the window motors, and some issues with the HVAC system.

**Engine**

**3.8L Series II V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking externally, often near the front or rear of the engine. Can lead to overheating if not addressed. May also have a sweet smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the upper and/or lower intake manifold gaskets. Often requires resurfacing of the intake manifold mating surfaces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idling, stalling, and a check engine light with MAF-related codes (e.g., P0101).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, no start condition, or intermittent misfires. Check engine light with crankshaft position sensor codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4T65-E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during torque converter lockup, especially at highway speeds. Can trigger transmission-related error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. May also require transmission flush and filter replacement.

**Summary**

The 2002 Buick LeSabre is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues, especially with the intake manifold, transmission, and electrical components. While some repairs, like the blower motor resistor, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or ABS module replacements, can be costly. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially significant mechanical problems. Careful inspection and preventative maintenance can help mitigate some of these risks.
