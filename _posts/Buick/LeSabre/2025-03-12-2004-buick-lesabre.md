Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2004 Buick LeSabre, categorized by system and engine/transmission configuration, following your specified format.

The 2004 Buick LeSabre is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability. It came with only one engine option: the 3.8L Series III V6, producing 205 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. It was paired exclusively with the 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the LeSabre for its smooth ride, large trunk, and dependability. Common dislikes included its somewhat bland styling and less-than-sporty handling.

**Engine**

**3.8L Series III V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, rough running engine. The lower intake manifold gasket is prone to failure due to the original plastic carrier material degrading over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the lower intake manifold gaskets with an updated gasket design using an aluminum or steel carrier.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+

*   **Coolant Elbow Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, low coolant level. The plastic coolant elbows connecting the bypass hose to the water pump and the heater hoses to the engine are prone to cracking and leaking.
    *   Solution: Replace the plastic coolant elbows with updated aluminum elbows.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

*   **Mass Air Flow Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor acceleration, rough idle, stalling, check engine light (typically with MAF sensor codes).
    *   Solution: Replace the mass air flow (MAF) sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

**Transmission**

**4T65-E (Four-Speed Automatic)**

*   **Shift Problems / Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping between gears, hard shifts, or failure to shift at all. Can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or solenoid failures within the transmission.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid change and filter replacement can temporarily alleviate symptoms. However, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3500 (rebuild or replacement)

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can also cause stalling or difficulty engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's generally recommended to flush the transmission and replace the filter during this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Poor handling and uneven tire wear can also result.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts. It's generally recommended to replace the struts themselves at the same time, as they are often worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (for struts and mounts)

*   **Rear Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the car sagging, compressor running constantly, error messages on the dashboard (if equipped).
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. It may also be necessary to replace the air springs if they are leaking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows not working or working intermittently. Often accompanied by a grinding noise.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400

*   **Ignition Switch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car not starting, stalling, or electrical accessories malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Replace the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400

*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illuminated on the dashboard, ABS system not functioning properly (i.e., not activating during hard braking).
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ABS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding/Yellowing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlight lenses become cloudy or yellowed, reducing headlight brightness and visibility.
    *   Solution: Polish the headlight lenses using a headlight restoration kit, or replace the headlight assemblies.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 (DIY kit) - $400+ (replacement assemblies)

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Recalls**

*   **Recall Number 04V582000**
    *   Description: General Motors Corp. (GM) is recalling 216,507 model year 2004-2005 Buick Lesabre and Pontiac Bonneville vehicles equipped with a front outboard lap/shoulder safety belt assembly. The driver or passenger front outboard lap/shoulder safety belt webbing may not fully retract. In the event of a crash, this condition could increase the risk of injury to the seat occupant.
    *   Solution: Dealers will inspect the safety belts for free and replace them if necessary.

*   **Recall Number 04V092000**
    *   Description: General Motors Corp. (GM) is recalling 4,570 model year 2004 Buick LeSabre vehicles equipped with a 3800 engine built between January 12, 2004, and February 13, 2004. The right front brake pipe may have been improperly flared and may not seal properly to the wheel hub assembly. The fitting could leak brake fluid resulting in reduced braking capability. This failure could result in a crash without warning.
    *   Solution: Dealers will inspect and replace the brake pipes for free.

**Summary**

The 2004 Buick LeSabre is generally a reliable car, but it is not immune to issues common in vehicles of its age. The most prevalent problems involve the engine (intake manifold leaks, coolant elbows) and transmission (slipping). Suspension issues, particularly strut mount failure, are also reported. Electrical problems can occur with power windows and the ignition switch. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission work, can be costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and obtain a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's condition.
