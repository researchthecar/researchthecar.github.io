The 2020 Buick Regal TourX is a station wagon offering practicality and a comfortable ride. All models are equipped with a 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 250 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the TourX for its spacious cargo area and European-inspired handling, while some criticisms include its limited availability and the discontinuation of the model after 2020.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (LTG)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust pipe.
    *   Solution: A revised PCV valve or piston ring design might be needed to address the issue. A compression test can help diagnose the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+, depending on the severity (PCV Valve Replacement vs. Piston Ring Replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks originating from the water pump or turbocharger coolant lines. Low coolant levels, engine overheating, and a sweet smell from the engine bay are common symptoms.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking water pump or coolant lines. Ensure proper torque specifications are followed during installation.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Aisin AWF8F35)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly when shifting between lower gears. Hesitation when accelerating or a "clunking" sound during gear changes may also be present.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) re-programming or software update can resolve the issue. A fluid flush and filter replacement may also help. More severe cases might require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software Update) - $4,000+ (Transmission Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the rear shock absorbers, leading to fluid leaks and diminished ride quality. Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and noise over bumps are indicators.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty shock absorbers. It is recommended to replace both rear shocks simultaneously.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: First, try a software update or a hard reset of the system. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+ (Infotainment Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains prematurely, especially when the car is not driven for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine or complete battery failure.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws by testing the amperage draw when the vehicle is turned off. Common causes include aftermarket accessories, a faulty body control module (BCM), or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear liftgate struts weaken and fail to support the weight of the liftgate, causing it to drop unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty liftgate struts. Replacing both struts simultaneously is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions, including getting stuck open or closed, making excessive noise during operation, or leaking water.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific problem (e.g., track misalignment, motor failure, damaged seals). Repair or replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Buick Regal TourX, while generally reliable, does exhibit some common issues. The most concerning are engine oil consumption and potential transmission problems, which could lead to expensive repairs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain can also be frustrating. While the suspension and exterior issues are less severe, they still require attention to maintain the vehicle's overall condition. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the car's maintenance history and be prepared for potential repairs related to these known issues.
