The 2019 Buick Regal TourX is a station wagon praised for its comfortable ride, spacious cargo area, and distinctive styling. It offers a blend of practicality and a touch of luxury. It came standard with a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 engine producing 250 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

The most significant concerns revolve around excessive oil consumption in the engine and transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting and torque converter shudder. These issues can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like software updates or fluid flushes to more costly repairs such as turbocharger or torque converter replacements. Electrical and sunroof issues, while less frequent, can also be inconvenient and expensive to address.
