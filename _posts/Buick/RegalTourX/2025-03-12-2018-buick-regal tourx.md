The 2018 Buick Regal TourX is a station wagon that offers a blend of practicality and near-luxury features. It was generally praised for its spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and responsive handling. However, some owners have reported experiencing certain issues with their vehicles. The TourX was offered with a single engine option, a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with an Aisin 8-speed automatic transmission. Some drivers found the engine somewhat unrefined and the fuel economy not as good as expected.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder (LTG)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The root cause varies. Some cases have been attributed to faulty positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valves or worn piston rings. Repair options range from replacing the PCV valve to a more extensive engine rebuild involving piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve) - $3000+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the turbocharger, including premature failure or reduced boost pressure. Symptoms can include a loss of power, unusual noises from the engine, and/or a check engine light with codes related to turbocharger performance.
    * Solution: Diagnose the turbocharger for damage or leaks. Replace the turbocharger assembly.

**Summary:**

The 2018 Buick Regal TourX, while praised for its practicality and comfort, has shown some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most concerning appear to be related to the engine (oil consumption, turbocharger issues) and transmission (harsh shifting). Electrical and suspension problems also crop up. The severity of these issues can range from relatively minor inconveniences to more costly repairs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems. While no recalls specific to these issues have been identified, it's always advisable to check the vehicle's VIN with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to ensure that all applicable recalls have been addressed.
