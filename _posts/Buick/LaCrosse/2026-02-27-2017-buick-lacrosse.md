# 2017 Buick LaCrosse

### Overview
The 2017 Buick LaCrosse, a mid-size luxury sedan, aimed to blend comfort, technology, and a refined driving experience. It was offered with a choice of two distinct powertrains: a standard 2.5L four-cylinder engine with eAssist mild-hybrid technology and a more potent 3.6L V6. Both were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The LaCrosse generally received positive reviews for its quiet cabin, smooth ride, and upscale interior. Reliability data for this model year suggests a generally solid performance, with most reported issues being minor or related to specific component failures rather than widespread systemic problems. Owners often praised its comfortable seating and advanced features for its time.
