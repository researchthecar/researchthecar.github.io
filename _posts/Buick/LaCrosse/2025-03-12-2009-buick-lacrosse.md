The 2009 Buick LaCrosse offered a blend of comfort and affordability, appealing to buyers seeking a mid-size sedan with a touch of luxury. Engine options included a 3.8L V6 producing around 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 (later in the model year) with around 255 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 with approximately 300 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the LaCrosse for its smooth ride and spacious interior but criticized its fuel economy and somewhat dated styling.
