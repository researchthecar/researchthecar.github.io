The 2016 Buick LaCrosse is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and quiet cabin. It offered a blend of luxury and value, appealing to buyers seeking a more refined driving experience without the premium price tag of some competitors. The 2016 LaCrosse came with two engine options: a 3.6L V6 producing 304 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 with eAssist light hybrid technology, producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the LaCrosse's comfortable seats, smooth ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes included its somewhat bland styling and the fuel economy of the V6 engine.
