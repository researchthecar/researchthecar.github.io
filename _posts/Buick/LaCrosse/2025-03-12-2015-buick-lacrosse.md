The 2015 Buick LaCrosse is a full-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. Available engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 with eAssist (mild hybrid system) producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 engine producing 304 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the LaCrosse for its quiet cabin, smooth ride, and ample trunk space. Common complaints include the sometimes-unresponsive infotainment system and average fuel economy for the V6.
