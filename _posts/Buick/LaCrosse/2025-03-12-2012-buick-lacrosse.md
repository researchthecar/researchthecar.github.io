Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2012 Buick LaCrosse, categorized by component and engine/transmission option, following your specified format. The 2012 Buick LaCrosse offered a blend of luxury and comfort, appealing to buyers looking for a refined driving experience. Engine options included a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 (182 hp, 172 lb-ft torque), a 3.0L V6 (255 hp, 217 lb-ft torque), and a 3.6L V6 (303 hp, 264 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the LaCrosse's quiet cabin, comfortable ride, and stylish design. Common dislikes included the somewhat uninspired handling and occasional reliability concerns, especially regarding electrical components.

**Engine**

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil at a higher-than-normal rate, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored. Symptoms include blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and a consistently low oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and repair required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The timing chain can stretch or wear prematurely, leading to rough running, a check engine light, and potential engine damage if not addressed.  Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially upon start-up, and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to timing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.  Often, it's recommended to replace the water pump at the same time, as it's driven by the timing chain on this engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Rough or jerky shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration.  Hesitation or delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse can also occur.
    *   Solution:  In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate the problem.  More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Excessive bouncing, poor ride quality, and clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.  Visible leaks from the struts or shocks are also indicators.
    *   Solution:  Replacing the worn struts or shocks.  It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period, leaving the vehicle unable to start. Can be due to a parasitic draw caused by a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the parasitic draw and repair the offending component. Common culprits include the radio, OnStar module, or body control module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the component causing the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate, either intermittently or completely. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, switch, or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window motor, switch, or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture builds up inside the headlight housing, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the headlight bulb or assembly.
    *   Solution: Remove and reseal the headlight housing, or replace the entire headlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reseal) - $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof fails to open or close properly, makes excessive noise, or leaks. This can be caused by a faulty motor, switch, or track.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sunroof motor, switch, track, or sealing components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the specific problem and parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Heated Seat Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Heated seats stop working or only work intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element, control module, or wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Buick LaCrosse, while a comfortable and stylish vehicle, is prone to certain issues. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption (2.4L) and timing chain issues (3.6L) can be costly. Transmission problems like harsh shifting can also surface. Electrical gremlins, particularly battery drain and power window failures, are common. Suspension components like struts and shocks will also need replacing as the vehicle ages. While not every LaCrosse will experience all these problems, being aware of them can help potential buyers make informed decisions and budget for potential repairs. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, from a few hundred dollars for a minor electrical fix to several thousand for a major engine or transmission repair.
