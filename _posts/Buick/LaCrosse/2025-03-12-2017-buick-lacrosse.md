The 2017 Buick LaCrosse is a full-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. The standard engine is a 3.6L V6 producing 310 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. A 2.5L 4-cylinder engine with an electric assist motor (eAssist) was also available. This eAssist system delivered 194 horsepower and 187 lb-ft of torque. The V6 engine is generally considered more desirable for its greater power and smoother operation. People like the LaCrosse for its quiet cabin, smooth ride, and upscale interior, while some dislike its somewhat bland styling and less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors.
