The 2010 Buick LaCrosse represented a significant step up for Buick, aiming for a more premium feel. Engine options included a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 producing 255 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 280 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the LaCrosse for its comfortable ride, quiet interior, and elegant styling, while some common complaints involved electrical glitches and certain engine-specific issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L Ecotec Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil frequently between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings may be necessary to resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or break, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. A rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup, is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioner is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L engine, the 3.6L V6 can experience timing chain issues, leading to rough running, misfires, and a check engine light. Diagnostic codes related to timing are common.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or delayed shifting, or the transmission slipping between gears. This may be more prevalent at higher mileages.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may help in some cases. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) to $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of struts and shock absorbers can lead to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shocks is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight or within a short period, even with a new battery.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting the electrical system to identify the source of the parasitic drain. Potential culprits include the OnStar module, radio, or other electronic components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Radio Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning navigation systems, unresponsive touchscreens, or radio failure have been reported.
    *   Solution: Resetting the system may temporarily resolve the issue. In some cases, replacement of the head unit is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility and potentially damaging the bulbs and housing.
    *   Solution: Removing the headlight housings and drying them out may temporarily fix the issue. Sealing the housings better can also help. Ultimately, the housings may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per headlight.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may stick, fail to open or close properly, or leak.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and lubricating the sunroof tracks and seals may resolve the issue. In some cases, the sunroof motor or other components may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Buick LaCrosse had a few common issues, particularly with the timing chains in the 2.4L and 3.6L engines, and occasional electrical gremlins. While the timing chain issue can be costly to repair, other problems are generally less severe. The 6-speed transmission can experience issues, but regular maintenance can help mitigate this. Overall, a careful inspection and maintenance history review are important when considering a 2010 Buick LaCrosse.
