The 2014 Buick LaCrosse is a full-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. Engine options for the 2014 LaCrosse include a 2.4L inline-4 with eAssist (mild hybrid system), producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 engine producing 304 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the LaCrosse for its quiet cabin, smooth ride, and luxurious features. Common complaints include lackluster fuel economy (especially with the V6), some issues with the infotainment system, and reports of certain electrical problems.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 with eAssist**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil more often than expected.
    *   Solution: The fix varies depending on the cause. It may involve replacing piston rings, valve seals, or addressing other engine component wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L V6 engine has been known to experience timing chain issues. Symptoms include engine misfires, rough running, a check engine light, and a rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or a hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3,500+ (rebuild/replacement)

*   **Infotainment System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have encountered issues with the MyLink infotainment system, including freezing, lagging, unresponsive touchscreens, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,200+ depending on the issue and whether replacement is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of the battery draining prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or requiring frequent jump-starts. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty component.
    *   Solution: Identifying and replacing the component causing the parasitic drain. This can involve diagnostics to isolate the faulty circuit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup (condensation) inside the headlight housings. This can reduce headlight effectiveness and potentially damage the headlight assembly over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight assembly or attempting to seal the existing assembly to prevent moisture intrusion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per headlight depending on the type of headlight and if it can be repaired.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin, particularly around the sunroof area, during rain or car washes. This can lead to water stains and potential damage to interior components.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof drains, repairing or replacing the sunroof seal, or addressing any structural damage to the sunroof assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the severity of the leak and necessary repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Buick LaCrosse, while generally a comfortable and reliable vehicle, has a few common problem areas. Engine issues like timing chain problems (3.6L V6) and excessive oil consumption (2.4L I4) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with harsh shifting can also occur. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and battery drain are also fairly common. Sunroof leaks and headlight condensation round out the issues. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs, and the cost to fix these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem.
