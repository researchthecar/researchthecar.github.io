The 2019 Buick LaCrosse is a full-size sedan offering a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. It was available with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 (194 hp, 190 lb-ft torque) paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, and a 3.6L V6 (310 hp, 268 lb-ft torque) paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the LaCrosse's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and elegant styling. Some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's responsiveness and the relatively uninspiring handling compared to sportier rivals.

**Summary:**

The 2019 Buick LaCrosse presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While the car is generally reliable, there are certain areas to be aware of. The most concerning problems appear to be related to the 3.6L V6 engine such as the valve spring failure and excessive oil consumption with the 2.5L engine, as well as harsh shifting in the 9-speed transmission. The electrical and infotainment systems also have reported problems but don't seem to be as severe. The cost to repair these issues can range from minor fixes to substantial repairs, making a thorough inspection before purchase crucial. The 9-speed transmission and 3.6L engine are the two primary areas of concern when considering the 2019 LaCrosse.
