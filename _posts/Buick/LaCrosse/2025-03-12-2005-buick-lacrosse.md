The 2005 Buick LaCrosse was introduced as a replacement for the Century and Regal. It offers a comfortable ride and spacious interior, making it a popular choice for families and those seeking a smooth highway cruiser. However, like any vehicle, the 2005 LaCrosse has its share of common issues. Available engine options included the 3.8L Series III V6 (200 hp, 225 lb-ft of torque) and the 3.6L High Feature V6 (240 hp, 225 lb-ft of torque), both paired with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. The 3.8L engine is known for its reliability, while the 3.6L offered more power and was only made available in 2005. Common likes include the comfortable ride, spacious interior, and quiet cabin. Dislikes often revolve around the somewhat bland styling, less-than-sporty handling, and some reported reliability issues.
