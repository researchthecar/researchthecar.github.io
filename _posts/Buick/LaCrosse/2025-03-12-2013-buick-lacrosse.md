The 2013 Buick LaCrosse is a mid-size luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 with eAssist (mild hybrid system), a 3.6L V6 engine, and a 2.0L Turbo 4-cylinder engine was offered later in the model year. The 3.6L V6 produces 303 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the LaCrosse's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and elegant styling. Common dislikes include the sometimes-confusing infotainment system, relatively soft handling, and the less-than-stellar fuel economy of the V6. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2013 Buick LaCrosse, while generally a comfortable and stylish sedan, can experience several notable issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 3.6L V6 (timing chain) and the 2.4L Inline-4 eAssist (excessive oil consumption, eAssist system failures), can be expensive to address. Transmission issues can also lead to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, primarily within the infotainment system, and suspension component wear are also common concerns. Overall, while some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite costly to repair, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection essential.
