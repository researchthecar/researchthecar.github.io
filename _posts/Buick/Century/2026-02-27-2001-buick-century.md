### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Buick Century offers a generally dependable ownership experience, especially concerning its powertrain if maintained. The most common significant issues tend to be related to the intake manifold gaskets on both engine options and potential torque converter or solenoid problems within the 4T65E transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can also arise. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are typical wear items for a vehicle of this age. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, while not immune to problems, many issues are addressable with moderate repair costs, making it a potentially cost-effective used car if well-maintained.
