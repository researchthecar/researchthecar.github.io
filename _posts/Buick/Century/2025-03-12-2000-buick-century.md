**Summary**

The 2000 Buick Century, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues related to its age. The most common problems revolve around the engine (specifically intake manifold gasket leaks) and transmission (torque converter issues). Suspension components also tend to wear out, leading to noise and handling problems. Electrical issues like power window failures are also common. Rust can be a concern in regions with harsh winters. While some of these repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others can be costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance costs when considering this vehicle.
