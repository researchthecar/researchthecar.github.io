### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Buick Century is a generally dependable vehicle, but potential buyers or current owners should be aware of common issues. The V6 engines, particularly the 3.1L and 3.8L, are susceptible to intake manifold gasket leaks and EGR valve clogging. The 4T65E transmission can experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints may require attention due to wear. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can arise. Exterior rust, especially in harsh climates, and interior HVAC blend door failures are also noted. Despite these potential issues, many of these are repairable and common for vehicles of this age and class.
