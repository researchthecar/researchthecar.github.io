The 2005 Buick Century is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and affordability. It came standard with a 3.1L V6 engine producing 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. There were no other engine or transmission options for this model year. Owners often appreciate the Century's smooth ride and reliability, while some common dislikes include its somewhat dated styling and less-than-stellar fuel economy.
