**2000 Buick Century**

The 2000 Buick Century is a midsize sedan offered with a choice of two engines: a 3.1L V6 or a supercharged 3.8L V6. Both engines are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 3.1L V6 produces 175 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, while the supercharged 3.8L V6 produces 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque.
