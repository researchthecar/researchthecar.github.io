### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Buick Century offers a generally dependable ownership experience, with its most common issues stemming from age and mileage rather than fundamental design flaws. The V6 engines, while robust, can develop intake manifold gasket leaks and EGR valve issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4T65-E, may experience torque converter or solenoid problems. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints are also susceptible to wear over time. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window regulators, can occur. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior climate control actuators and dashboard lighting can also require attention. Despite these potential repairs, the Century remains a practical choice if well-maintained.
