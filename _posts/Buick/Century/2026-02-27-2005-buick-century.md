### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Buick Century offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly if well-maintained. The most common concerns tend to revolve around the powertrain, specifically intake manifold gasket leaks on both V6 engines and potential issues with the 4T65-E transmission's torque converter clutch and solenoids. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. While suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints may require attention over time, they are not typically considered major design flaws. Overall, the Century is a practical choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor them into their long-term ownership costs.
