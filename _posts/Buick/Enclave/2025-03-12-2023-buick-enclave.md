The 2023 Buick Enclave is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and upscale features. It offers a single engine option: a 3.6L V6 engine that produces 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Enclave's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and ample cargo space. Common dislikes include its somewhat uninspired handling and the infotainment system's occasional glitches.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6 (LGY)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may be indicated by low oil level warnings or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Addressing excessive oil consumption can involve several steps. First, inspect for any external oil leaks around the engine. If no leaks are found, the issue may be internal, related to piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test can help assess the condition of the piston rings. Depending on the diagnosis, repairs may involve replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or even a complete engine rebuild in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity of the problem and the required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain may stretch or wear prematurely, leading to engine misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) such as P0008 or P0009 may be present. In advanced cases, the engine may not start.
    *   Solution: The solution involves replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. It's often recommended to replace the water pump at the same time, as it's driven by the timing chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (9T65)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or delayed shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or "jerk" when the transmission shifts.
    *   Solution: The issue might be a software issue in the TCM. The dealer can try and re-flash the software to see if that resolves the problem. If not, it could be an issue with the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (for a software re-flash) - $3,000+ (for valve body replacement or transmission rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip during acceleration, causing a momentary loss of power or an increase in engine RPM without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can be accompanied by unusual noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Transmission slipping often indicates internal wear or damage. Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, a fluid change and filter replacement may help. However, if the slipping persists, more extensive repairs, such as a transmission rebuild or replacement, may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Glitching**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or exhibit glitches such as delayed responses or incorrect information display. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Start by performing a hard reset of the infotainment system (refer to the owner's manual for instructions). If the issue persists, a software update from the dealer may be required. In some cases, replacement of the infotainment system module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $1,200+ (module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery. This can occur even when the vehicle is not in use.
    *   Solution: The battery and charging system should be tested to determine if the battery is defective or if there's an issue with the alternator. If the battery and charging system are functioning properly, a parasitic draw test can be performed to identify any circuits or modules that are drawing excessive current when the vehicle is off. Common culprits include faulty door modules or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (battery replacement) - $500+ (diagnosing and repairing parasitic draw).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof or moonroof may leak, fail to open or close properly, or make unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sunroof drains for any clogs or obstructions. Clean the drains with compressed air or a flexible wire. If the sunroof motor is faulty, it may need to be replaced. For leaks, the sunroof seal may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (drain cleaning) - $800+ (motor or seal replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to heat up, overheat, or only work intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check the seat heater fuse and relay. If those are good, the heating element within the seat may be damaged and need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $10 (fuse/relay) - $500+ (heating element replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close properly, become slow or unresponsive, or make unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts for any signs of wear or damage. If the struts are weak, they may need to be replaced. The liftgate motor or control module may also be faulty and require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (strut replacement) - $1,000+ (motor or module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2023 Buick Enclave, while generally a comfortable and spacious SUV, has a few potential problem areas. The most concerning are the potential engine issues (excessive oil consumption and timing chain wear), and the transmission issues (harsh shifting and slipping) as they can be costly to repair. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain are also common, though often less severe. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a pre-purchase inspection to assess the vehicle's condition. The cost of repairs can range from minor fixes to major engine or transmission work, so budgeting for potential maintenance is advisable.
