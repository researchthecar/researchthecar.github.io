**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil every few thousand miles, blue smoke from the exhaust (though not always present), and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: The solution often involves replacing the valve cover with an updated PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain may stretch or wear prematurely, leading to engine misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light. This is due to the oil squirters going bad. Error codes include P0008 or P0017. Left unaddressed, it can lead to significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially other related components. Replacing the oil squirters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500-$3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or harsh shifting between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. The transmission may also hesitate or "clunk" when shifting.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or transmission fluid flush may resolve the issue. However, more severe cases may require valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $800-$1500+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip or fail to engage properly, resulting in a loss of power or inability to accelerate.
    *   Solution: This may require a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4000 - $7000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. Other symptoms include Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation errors, and screen flickering.
    *   Solution: Often, a software update can resolve these issues. In some cases, the infotainment module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500-$1500+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can lead to starting problems or a complete failure to start.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. If those are fine, perform a parasitic draw test to identify the circuit that's causing the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (New Battery) - $100-$500+ (Parasitic Draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may fail to display an image or show a distorted or blurry image.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. If those are good, replace the backup camera.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, often noticeable after rain, usually around the headliner or A-pillars.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the sunroof drain tubes is a good starting point. If that doesn't fix the leak, the sunroof seal may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cleaning drains) to $300-$800+ (seal replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Issues (Climate Control)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the heating or cooling system, inconsistent temperature control, or unusual noises from the HVAC system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the underlying issue. Could involve replacing the blend door actuator or a refrigerant leak.

The most significant concerns relate to potential engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption and timing chain wear, which can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, particularly rough shifting, are also reported. Electrical problems, especially with the infotainment system, can be annoying. Overall, while not all Enclaves will experience these issues, being aware of the potential problems can help buyers make informed decisions and budget for potential repairs. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly, but addressing these issues promptly can help prevent further damage and maintain the vehicle's reliability.
