The 2016 Buick Enclave is a popular full-size crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and quiet cabin. It offered a good balance of luxury and practicality for families. People often praised the Enclave for its smooth highway cruising, ample cargo space, and seating for up to eight passengers. Some common complaints include its relatively poor fuel economy, large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and the dated infotainment system compared to newer models. All 2016 Enclaves came with a 3.6L V6 engine producing 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. There were no other engine or transmission options offered.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may experience rough idling, misfires, and a check engine light with codes related to timing issues (e.g., P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018, P0019). The engine may also develop a rattling noise, especially upon startup.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners. Sometimes, the camshaft phasers may also need replacement depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car may experience long cranks, a no-start condition, or a loss of power during acceleration. A check engine light will typically illuminate. Diagnostic codes may include P0087 or similar fuel pressure-related codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during light acceleration (especially in lower gears), difficulty shifting, and potential stalling. Diagnostic codes related to torque converter clutch (TCC) malfunction might be present (e.g., P0741).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, it is recommended to flush the transmission and inspect for debris that could have caused the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wave Plate Failure (Specifically 3-5-R Wave Plate)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a common failure point on this transmission. Loss of 3rd, 5th, and reverse gears is common.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken wave plate. In most cases, a full rebuild or replacement of the transmission is required, as debris can contaminate the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, uneven tire wear, and noises (clunking or squeaking) coming from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts or shock absorbers. It is generally recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per pair, depending on labor and part cost.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Worn sway bar links can affect handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sway bar links. Often replaced in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per pair, depending on labor and part cost.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or the vehicle failing to start after being parked for a relatively short period. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic draw using a multimeter and isolation of the faulty component. Repair or replacement of the offending module or accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for diagnosis and repair, depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor for the heating and air conditioning system only works on certain speeds (e.g., high only) or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, may make unusual noises, or may get stuck in a certain position. This could be due to a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the issue and replacement of the faulty component. This may involve replacing the liftgate motor, struts, sensors, or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the failed part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Sunroof/Windshield)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin, often noticed after rain or washing the car. Common leak areas are around the sunroof or windshield seals. This can lead to musty odors and potential damage to interior components.
    *   Solution: Resealing the sunroof or windshield. Cleaning and unclogging sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source and complexity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential problem with the airbag system. This can be due to a faulty sensor, wiring issue, or a problem with the airbag control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the airbag system using a scan tool to identify the specific fault code. Repair or replacement of the faulty component, which may include sensors, wiring, or the airbag control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the faulty part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appear on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement.

**Summary**

The 2016 Buick Enclave, while a comfortable and spacious vehicle, does have some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine-related problems such as timing chain issues and HPFP failures can be costly to repair. The transmission is a known weak point, specifically the wave plate failure. Electrical issues like battery drain can also be frustrating. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive, so a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are recommended before purchasing a used 2016 Enclave.
