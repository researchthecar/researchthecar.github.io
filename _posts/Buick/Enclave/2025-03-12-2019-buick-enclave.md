Here's a breakdown of common issues reported by owners of the 2019 Buick Enclave, categorized by major component and engine/transmission option, formatted for your website.

The 2019 Buick Enclave is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and stylish design. It offers seating for up to seven passengers and is powered by a 3.6L V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the Enclave's luxurious features and smooth driving experience, common complaints revolve around electrical system glitches, transmission performance, and issues with the climate control system. Some find the infotainment system clunky and the fuel economy less than ideal.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil warning light, engine knocking, or visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: The issue can stem from worn valve seals, piston rings, or issues with the PCV valve. A compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source. Repairs can range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive engine work like valve seal or piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve) - $3000+ (Engine Overhaul)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating, often accompanied by a specific cylinder misfire code (e.g., P0301 for Cylinder 1).
    * Solution: This can be due to faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Diagnosis involves checking the spark plugs and coils for wear or damage and testing the fuel injectors. Replacing the affected components is the usual solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (9T65)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. Some experience hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM) might resolve some instances. In other cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $4,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs higher than normal during acceleration, or the vehicle seems to lose power intermittently, indicating that the transmission is slipping.
    *   Solution: Low transmission fluid is a possibility. If the fluid level is correct, further investigation is needed to identify the cause, which could be worn clutch packs or a faulty torque converter. Transmission replacement may be necessary
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Fluid) - $4,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen becomes unresponsive, freezes, or restarts unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update might resolve the issue. If not, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,000+ (Replacement Unit)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery dies prematurely, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for a short period.
    *   Solution: A parasitic draw test can identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Battery Replacement) - $500+ (Diagnosing and Repairing Parasitic Draw)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Backup Camera Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The backup camera screen goes black or displays a distorted image when the vehicle is put in reverse.
    * Solution: Check the wiring connections to the camera. If connections are good, the camera module or the camera itself may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate fails to open or close properly, or it makes unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Inspect the liftgate struts and sensors for damage. Resetting the liftgate system might resolve the issue. In some cases, the liftgate motor or control module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Reset/Sensor Adjustment) - $700+ (Motor Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AC blows warm air instead of cold air, or the heater blows cold air. Sometimes, the fan speed is erratic or doesn't work at all.
    *   Solution: Check the refrigerant level and compressor operation. Faulty blend door actuators, blower motor resistors, or a failing compressor could be the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Refrigerant Recharge) - $1000+ (Compressor Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters stop working, or they only heat up intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check the heating element, wiring harness, and switch. Replacing the heating element or switch might resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin through the sunroof during rain or washing.
    *   Solution: Clean the sunroof drain tubes to ensure proper water drainage. If the leak persists, the sunroof seal may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (Cleaning Drain Tubes) - $300+ (Seal Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Buick Enclave presents a mix of potential issues. While some owners experience relatively minor electrical glitches with the infotainment system or climate control, others face more significant concerns with the engine (oil consumption) and transmission (harsh shifting). The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue, ranging from relatively inexpensive fixes like software updates to more substantial expenses like engine or transmission replacement. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used Enclave before purchase.
