The 2010 Buick Enclave is a full-size crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and smooth engine. It came equipped with a 3.6L V6 engine, producing approximately 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. It was available exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Enclave for its quiet cabin, comfortable seating, and ample cargo space, making it a good choice for families. Common complaints include issues with the vehicle's reliability, specifically concerning the transmission and electrical systems, as well as its relatively poor fuel economy compared to newer models.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit a rattling noise, particularly on startup. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) such as P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018, or P0019 may be present. Can lead to decreased engine performance and, in severe cases, engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, tensioners, and guides is required. Often, the high-pressure fuel pump is also replaced due to its location on the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit hard start or no start conditions. The engine may run rough or stall. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel pressure may be present
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump and any related components, if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (GM 6T70)**

*   **Wave Plate Failure (3-5-R)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, especially between 3rd and 5th gear. Loss of 3rd, 5th, or reverse gears may occur.
    *   Solution: Complete transmission rebuild or replacement. The updated wave plate (improved heat treatment) should be installed to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations, especially during light acceleration or when the torque converter locks up. Transmission may overheat. Can also cause internal transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter and a transmission flush. Inspect the transmission fluid cooler for debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Leveling System Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle may sag, or the compressor may run constantly or not at all. Error messages related to the suspension system may be displayed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Steering may feel loose.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts. Often, the struts themselves are replaced at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Liftgate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may not open or close properly, or may make unusual noises. May stop working altogether.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by faulty liftgate struts, motor, latch, or wiring harness. Diagnosis is required to pinpoint the exact cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery may drain overnight, requiring a jump start. This can be caused by parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw and repairing or replacing the faulty component. This can be time-consuming and expensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or tapping noises from behind the dashboard. Inconsistent temperature control, with hot or cold air blowing from vents even when the temperature setting is different.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty HVAC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Buick Enclave, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, suffers from a few notable reliability concerns. The most significant issues revolve around the transmission (wave plate and torque converter failures) and engine (timing chain wear). These problems can be costly to repair, often exceeding $3,000. Electrical issues such as power liftgate failure and battery drain problems are also relatively common and add to the ownership expenses. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, including getting a pre-purchase inspection to catch potential issues early.
