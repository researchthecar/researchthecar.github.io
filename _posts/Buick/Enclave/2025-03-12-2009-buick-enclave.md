**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A stretched or worn timing chain can cause the check engine light to illuminate. The engine may also exhibit rough idling, misfires, and decreased performance. A rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup, is another symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially the camshaft actuators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough idling, inability to start, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Hydra-Matic 6T70)**

*   **Wave Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, loss of certain gears (often 3rd and 5th), and the check engine light illuminating. The wave plate is a thin, stamped metal part within the transmission that can crack or break.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement, including wave plate replacement and inspection of other internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, difficulty shifting, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and leaking fluid from the struts/shocks. Uneven tire wear can also be a sign.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected struts or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Leveling System Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sags, especially when loaded. The air compressor for the leveling system may run constantly or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air compressor, air shocks, and/or height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or after a short period of inactivity. This can be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty module or component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic draw, which may involve replacing a module (e.g., Body Control Module, radio, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows or door locks. This can be caused by faulty switches, wiring problems, or a failing Body Control Module (BCM).
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty switch, repairing the wiring, or replacing the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per window/door)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Actuator Failure**
