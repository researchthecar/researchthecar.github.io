The 2022 Buick Enclave is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. The sole engine option for the 2022 Enclave is a 3.6L V6 engine producing 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Enclave's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and ample cargo space. Criticisms often center around its fuel economy compared to competitors and the sometimes-hesitant shifting of the 9-speed transmission. Some find the exterior styling somewhat bland.
