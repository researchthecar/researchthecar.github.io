The 2013 Buick Enclave is a popular full-size crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and quiet cabin. It's powered by a 3.6L V6 engine, producing 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. There were no other engine or transmission options offered for this model year. Owners often appreciate the Enclave's ample cargo space, seating for up to eight passengers, and its smooth highway cruising. However, common complaints include issues with the vehicle's reliability and build quality, specifically pertaining to the transmission and electrical systems. The vehicle does offer a good value in the used car market, but potential buyers should be aware of the common problems outlined below.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Stretching**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. The check engine light may illuminate with codes related to timing chain performance or camshaft/crankshaft correlation. Can lead to poor engine performance and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chains, tensioners, guides, and potentially the camshaft sprockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, long crank times, stalling, or reduced engine power. Check engine light with codes related to fuel pressure or HPFP performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Hydra-Matic 6T70)**

*   **Wave Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or complete loss of certain gears (typically 3rd or 5th). This is due to a fractured 3-5-R wave plate inside the transmission.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement, including replacement of the wave plate with an updated, stronger design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can also cause erratic shifting or stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter and potentially a transmission flush and filter change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging/Failure**

    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shocks or springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or within a few days, even when the vehicle is not in use. May require frequent jump-starts. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic draw using a multimeter and identifying the faulty component. Repair or replacement of the affected module or accessory.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power liftgate fails to open or close properly, may make unusual noises, or may stop working altogether.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the liftgate motor, struts, or latch mechanism. Replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Touchscreen freezes, fails to respond to inputs, or displays error messages. The navigation system may lose its GPS signal.
    *   Solution: Software update of the infotainment system. If the issue persists, replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $1,000+ (for head unit replacement)
