The 2012 Buick Enclave is a popular full-size crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and upscale features. It offers seating for up to eight passengers, making it a good choice for families. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential problems. Common praises include its smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample cargo space. Complaints often revolve around its size (making it difficult to maneuver), fuel economy, and some reliability concerns. The 2012 Enclave comes with only one engine option: a 3.6L V6 engine producing 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

* **Timing Chain Wear/Stretching**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, check engine light illuminated (often with codes P0008, P0016, P0017, P0018, P0019), rough idling, and in some cases, complete engine failure. The timing chains are prone to premature wear, especially if oil changes are neglected or if the oil level is allowed to drop too low.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chains, chain guides, tensioners, and potentially the variable valve timing (VVT) actuators. In severe cases, engine damage may necessitate a complete engine replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.6L V6 used in the Enclave relies on a High Pressure Fuel Pump to feed fuel to the direct injection system at the required pressure. Over time, the HPFP can fail, resulting in long crank times, rough idle, lack of power, and eventually a no-start condition. A check engine light will also be present
    * Solution: Replacement of the HPFP.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Hydra-Matic 6T70)**

* **Wave Plate Failure (3-5-R Clutch)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, especially between 3rd and 5th gear. Slipping during acceleration, particularly when the transmission attempts to shift into 3rd or 5th gear. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to incorrect gear ratio. This is a very common issue for this transmission model across multiple vehicle makes and models.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement, including the installation of an updated/reinforced wave plate.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (for rebuild or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations, especially at low speeds or during light acceleration. Stalling, particularly when coming to a stop. Harsh shifting.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. A transmission flush may also be recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sag/Failure (Specifically if equipped with Electronic Level Control)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sags lower than normal, especially when loaded. The electronic air compressor runs constantly or doesn't run at all. Ride quality is compromised.
    * Solution: Replacement of the air springs/shocks, air compressor, and potentially the height sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and which components need replacing)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll when cornering, and longer stopping distances. Visible leaks from the struts/shocks.
    * Solution: Replacement of the struts/shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (depending on whether you replace struts or shocks, and all four vs just one or two)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, and the need for frequent jump starts.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the drain (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory, etc.). Repair or replacement of the affected component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power liftgate fails to open or close properly, gets stuck mid-operation, or makes unusual noises.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the liftgate motor, struts, latch assembly, or related wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **HVAC Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Blower motor only works on certain settings (e.g., high only) or not at all.
    * Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Water Leaks (Sunroof/Windshield)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, often resulting in wet carpets, musty odors, and potential electrical issues.
    * Solution: Resealing the sunroof or windshield, clearing clogged drain tubes.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Airbag Light Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light is illuminated on the dash. The code is often B0092, which is for the driver's side front airbag loop resistance.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the clockspring or harness that causes the resistance in the circuit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard, typically near the center console or the vents.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive) or installation of a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for a cover) - $1,500+ (for full dashboard replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Buick Enclave, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, has some common issues to be aware of. The most significant concerns relate to the engine (timing chain wear) and transmission (wave plate failure), which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, suspension problems, and interior concerns are also present, although generally less severe. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history, listen for any unusual noises during a test drive, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before making a purchase. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor electrical fixes to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls.
