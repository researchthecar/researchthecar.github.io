The 2015 Buick Enclave is a popular full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and quiet cabin. It came standard with a 3.6L V6 engine producing 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Enclave's ample passenger and cargo space, making it a good choice for families. However, some common complaints include the vehicle's size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, its fuel economy, and potential reliability issues.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6 (LY7/LLT)**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, engine misfires, rattling noise from the engine, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed. Often triggered by low oil levels or infrequent oil changes, leading to premature wear of the timing chain components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, guides, and tensioner. In some cases, the variable valve timing (VVT) solenoids may also need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Extended cranking time, rough idling, and decreased performance. A failed HPFP will result in low fuel pressure to the direct injection system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T70/6T75)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can also manifest as harsh shifting or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary if the failure has caused significant damage to the transmission internals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wave Plate Failure (Specifically in 3-5-R Wave Plate)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping, harsh shifts, or complete loss of 3rd, 5th, or reverse gear. Debris from the broken wave plate can circulate through the transmission, causing further damage.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. This usually involves replacing the wave plate and thoroughly cleaning the transmission to remove debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncing, excessive body roll, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Leaking fluid from the strut/shock is a visual indicator of failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected strut(s) or shock absorber(s). It is generally recommended to replace them in pairs (both front or both rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise from the wheels, especially noticeable at higher speeds. The noise may change or disappear when turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected wheel bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting, and needing to jump-start the vehicle frequently. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing and replacing faulty modules, relays, or accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks that do not respond to the remote or the interior switch. The door may not lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The liftgate does not stay open or closes unexpectedly. This can be a safety hazard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found
