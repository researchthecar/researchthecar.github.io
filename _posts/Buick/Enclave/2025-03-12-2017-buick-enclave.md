The 2017 Buick Enclave is a popular three-row SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and upscale features. It offered a good balance of luxury and practicality for families. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues reported by owners. The 2017 Enclave came with a single engine option: a 3.6L V6 engine producing 288 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Enclave's smooth ride and quiet cabin, but common complaints included issues with the infotainment system, transmission shifting, and some electrical malfunctions.
