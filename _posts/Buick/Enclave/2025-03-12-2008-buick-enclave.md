All 2008 Enclaves came equipped with a 3.6-liter V6 engine producing around 275 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Enclave's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and ample cargo space. However, some common complaints included issues with the timing chain, transmission problems, and electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.6L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illuminated with codes related to camshaft position, rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. This is a very common issue in earlier model years and is often caused by oil starvation or infrequent oil changes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, sprockets, guides, and tensioners. In some cases, camshaft replacement may also be necessary.

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine Stalling, Misfiring, Extended Cranking, Check Engine light
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Hydra-Matic 6T70)**

*   **Wave Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, transmission slipping, especially between 3rd and 5th gear, delayed engagement, check engine light illuminated with transmission-related codes. The wave plate inside the transmission is known to crack and fail.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement, including replacement of the wave plate with an updated/reinforced version.
