The 2003 Buick Regal is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Engine options included a 3.8L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. It was only available with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Regal's smooth ride and reliability, but disliked its somewhat bland styling and dated interior features. Common complaints revolved around specific mechanical issues that tended to surface as the car aged.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6 (L36)**

*   **Intake Manifold Leak (Coolant)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking from the plastic intake manifold, often near the throttle body or the coolant elbows. This can lead to overheating, coolant loss, and eventually engine damage if not addressed. Sweet coolant smell may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the plastic intake manifold with an upgraded aftermarket version that uses improved materials, often aluminum or reinforced composite.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience rough idling, stalling, poor acceleration, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating with a MAF sensor code (e.g., P0101, P0102).
    *   Solution: Replacing the MAF sensor is the typical solution. Cleaning it may temporarily resolve the issue, but replacement is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues starting the car, rough idling or stalling, especially when the engine is cold. The car may be difficult to drive at low speeds and the check engine light could illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the engine, rough running/misfiring, poor fuel economy, and the smell of fuel. The Check Engine Light may also be illuminated.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per injector

    *   Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, worn solenoids, or internal damage to the transmission. Requires transmission service, solenoid replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at certain speeds, especially during torque converter lockup. Can also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll during turns, longer stopping distances, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Sway Bar Links/Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the sway bar links and/or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, making grinding noises, or moving slowly and erratically.

**Summary**

The 2003 Buick Regal, while generally reliable, faces several common issues related to its age. Engine problems, particularly coolant leaks from the intake manifold and sensor failures, are prevalent. Transmission issues, such as hard shifting, can be costly to address. Suspension wear and electrical malfunctions are also common concerns. Rust can be a significant issue in regions with harsh winters. The severity and cost of these issues can vary greatly depending on the vehicle's condition and the specific problem. Addressing these issues promptly is essential to maintaining the Regal's reliability and longevity.
