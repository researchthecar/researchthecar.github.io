### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Buick Regal, particularly with the popular 3.8L V6 engines, is a generally robust vehicle. However, common issues tend to revolve around the intake manifold gaskets, especially on the naturally aspirated version, and potential torque converter or solenoid problems in the 4T65-E transmission. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, can also arise. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints may require attention as mileage increases. While exterior paint can show age with clear coat issues, and interior climate control actuators can fail, these are not typically catastrophic. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known weak points, the 2003 Regal can remain a reliable daily driver.
