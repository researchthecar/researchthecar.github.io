**Summary**

The 2014 Buick Regal can be a reliable vehicle but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the 2.0L turbo engine and the 6-speed transmission. The high-pressure fuel pump and turbocharger issues on the 2.0L turbo engine can be costly to repair. While the transmission issues aren't always severe, they can lead to expensive repairs if neglected. Overall, pre-purchase inspections are recommended, and diligent maintenance, including regular fluid changes, can help mitigate some of these problems.
