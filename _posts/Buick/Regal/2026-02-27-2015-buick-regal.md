### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Buick Regal generally demonstrates good reliability, with the 2.4L engine being particularly trouble-free. The 2.0L turbo engine, while offering better performance, has a higher likelihood of experiencing issues such as turbocharger problems and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission is mostly dependable, but some owners have reported issues with harsh shifting or leaks, necessitating fluid services or more extensive repairs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Overall, the Regal is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific concerns related to the turbocharged engine and transmission, especially on higher-mileage examples.
