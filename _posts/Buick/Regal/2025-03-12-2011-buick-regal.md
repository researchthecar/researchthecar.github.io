The 2011 Buick Regal marked the return of the Regal nameplate to the North American market. It was positioned as a sporty, near-luxury sedan, offering a blend of comfort and performance. Engine options included a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 (182 hp, 172 lb-ft torque), a 2.0L turbocharged Ecotec inline-4 (220 hp, 260 lb-ft torque), and, later in the model year, a 2.4L eAssist mild-hybrid system (182 hp, 172 lb-ft torque plus a small electric boost). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Regal's styling, comfortable ride, and relatively affordable price point. Common complaints included some reliability issues, smaller-than-expected rear seat space, and occasionally uninspired handling compared to European rivals.

**Summary**

The 2011 Buick Regal, while offering a stylish and comfortable experience, does have some common issues owners have reported. The most significant of which seem to be the excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine and transmission issues. These, along with potential electrical and suspension problems, can lead to moderate to high repair costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed to identify any existing problems.
