The 2002 Buick Regal is a mid-size sedan that was available in two trims: LS and GS. It was known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and overall reliability. The LS model came standard with a 3.8L Series II V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4T65-E 4-speed automatic transmission. The GS model featured a supercharged version of the 3.8L V6, generating 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, also mated to the 4T65-E transmission. Some common likes about the 2002 Regal included its smooth ride, strong engine (especially in the GS trim), and spacious cabin. Dislikes often centered around the somewhat dated styling, and the fact that it was not as fuel efficient as some of its competitors.

**Engine**

**3.8L Series II V6 (L36) - Naturally Aspirated**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, overheating, white smoke from exhaust, rough idle. The plastic intake manifold gaskets are known to degrade and leak coolant.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets with updated, higher-quality gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

*   **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor fuel economy, rough idle, stalling, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**3.8L Supercharged Series II V6 (L67)**

*   **Supercharger Coupler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or grinding noise from the supercharger, loss of boost/power. The supercharger coupler is a nylon piece that connects the supercharger snout to the rotors. It wears out over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger coupler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, loss of power, check engine light. The intercooler pump circulates coolant through the intercooler to cool the air entering the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

**Transmission**

**4T65-E 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during light throttle at highway speeds, poor fuel economy, stalling. The TCC locks up to improve fuel economy but can fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter or rebuild the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, transmission slipping, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noise from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps.

**Summary:**

The 2002 Buick Regal, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners may encounter. Engine problems like intake manifold leaks and supercharger coupler failures (on the GS model) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as torque converter clutch failure, are also a concern. Suspension and electrical problems are generally less expensive to fix, but can still be inconvenient. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission repairs.
