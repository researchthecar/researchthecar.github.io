### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Buick Regal presents a mixed reliability profile. The turbocharged 2.0L engine, while offering good performance, has a higher propensity for turbocharger and oil leak issues compared to the naturally aspirated 2.4L. The 2.4L engine is more prone to oil consumption and timing chain problems. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic gearbox, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted. The suspension and exterior/interior components generally fare better, with fewer widespread complaints. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in possible repair costs.
