### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Buick Regal generally presents a solid reliability record, with most owners reporting satisfaction. The most common technical concerns tend to revolve around the turbocharged engine's components, such as the turbocharger itself and potential oil leaks, as well as occasional issues with the automatic transmission's smooth operation. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, can also arise. While the naturally aspirated engine is less prone to turbo-related issues, timing chain concerns have been noted. Suspension components like struts can wear over time, and interior climate control systems may experience blower motor failures. Overall, the Regal is a dependable choice, but prospective buyers should be aware of these specific potential maintenance points.
