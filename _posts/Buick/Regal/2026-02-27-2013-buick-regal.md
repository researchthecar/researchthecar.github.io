### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Buick Regal presents a generally reliable profile, with most reported issues concentrated in the powertrain and electrical systems. The turbocharged 2.0L engine is more prone to issues like turbocharger failure and PCV system clogging compared to the naturally aspirated 2.4L, which can experience timing chain problems. Automatic transmission issues, such as hesitation, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and Body Control Module, can be a source of frustration. Suspension components like strut mounts may require attention. Exterior and interior components are largely free of widespread defects. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and consider a pre-purchase inspection.
