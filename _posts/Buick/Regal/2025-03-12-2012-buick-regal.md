The 2012 Buick Regal offered a blend of near-luxury features and sporty handling, appealing to those seeking a step up from mainstream sedans. Engine choices included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 generating 220 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 with eAssist mild hybrid technology producing 182 horsepower and 172 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Regal's stylish exterior, comfortable interior, and composed ride. Criticisms commonly centered around the somewhat cramped rear seat and the occasionally sluggish response of the non-turbo 2.4L engine.
