### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Buick Regal presents a generally reliable package, with its most common reported issues centering around the powertrain, particularly the 2.4L naturally aspirated engine's oil consumption and timing chain concerns, and potential turbocharger issues with the 2.0L turbo variant. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting and torque converter issues, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system and sensors, can occur. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread significant problems. Regular maintenance, especially monitoring oil levels and addressing early signs of transmission trouble, is recommended for owners of the 2011 Regal.
