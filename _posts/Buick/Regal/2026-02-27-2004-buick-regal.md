### Summary Verdict

However, common issues to be aware of include intake manifold gasket leaks and EGR valve problems on the naturally aspirated V6, and potential head gasket issues on the supercharged variant. Transmission problems, especially with the torque converter clutch on the 4T65E, can arise. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may require attention due to age and mileage. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and alternator failures, are also reported. Interior comfort features like the HVAC blend door actuators can fail. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling are cosmetic but common for vehicles of this age. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known issues, the Regal can remain a dependable car.
