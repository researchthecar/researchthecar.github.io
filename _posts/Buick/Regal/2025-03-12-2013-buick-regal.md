The 2013 Buick Regal is a mid-size sedan that offers a blend of comfort, style, and performance. The available engine options for the 2013 model year include a 2.4L inline-4 engine (182 hp, 172 lb-ft of torque), a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine (220 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine in the GS model (270 hp, 295 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Regal's quiet cabin, comfortable ride, and stylish design. However, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, electrical glitches, and certain engine-related problems.
