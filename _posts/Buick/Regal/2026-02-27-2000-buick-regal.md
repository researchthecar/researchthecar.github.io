### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Buick Regal, particularly with the naturally aspirated 3.8L V6, is generally considered a reliable vehicle. Common issues tend to be related to the intake manifold gaskets and EGR valve, which are manageable repairs. The supercharged variant introduces potential concerns with its belt and clutch. Transmission issues, primarily with the 4T65E, can involve the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like strut mounts and ball joints may require attention due to age. Electrical gremlins, especially with the BCM and alternator, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. Overall, while not immune to problems, the Regal offers a decent ownership experience if well-maintained, with most issues being repairable.
