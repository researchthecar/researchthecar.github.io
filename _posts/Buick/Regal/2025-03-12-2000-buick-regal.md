The 2000 Buick Regal is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. This model year offered two engine options: a 3.8L V6 (L36) producing around 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, and a supercharged 3.8L V6 (L67) producing around 240 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Regal's smooth ride and reliability, particularly the 3800 V6 engine. Common dislikes included the car's somewhat dated styling, occasional electrical issues, and the lower fuel economy of the supercharged version.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6 (L36)**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine coolant leaks externally, often pooling near the front or rear of the engine. Can lead to overheating if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets with updated versions (often a revised design).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Mass Air Flow Sensor (MAF) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine idles roughly, poor fuel economy, check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the Mass Air Flow Sensor (MAF).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.8L Supercharged V6 (L67)**
* **Supercharger Coupler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the supercharger, loss of boost, reduced engine power.
    * Solution: Replace the supercharger coupler (a small plastic or metal part connecting the supercharger rotor to the drive pulley).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced supercharger performance, elevated intake air temperatures, potential for engine knock.
    * Solution: Replace the intercooler pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4T65-E**
* **Pressure Control Solenoid Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, transmission error codes.
    * Solution: Replace the pressure control solenoid within the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on labor and parts)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, particularly when the torque converter locks up. Can lead to overheating of the transmission.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter, and potentially flush the transmission fluid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (due to transmission removal)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noise from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace the front strut mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Coil Spring Sagging or Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower in the rear, poor ride quality, potential for bottoming out.
    * Solution: Replace the rear coil springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window moves slowly or not at all, grinding noise when operating the window.
    * Solution: Replace the power window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Headlight Dimming/Flickering**
    * Description/Symptoms: Headlights dim or flicker intermittently, often caused by a failing headlight switch or ground connection.
    * Solution: Inspect and repair or replace the headlight switch and check ground connections.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Wells**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the lower body panels, especially around the rocker panels and wheel wells. This is more prevalent in regions that use road salt.
    * Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. This can range from patching small areas to replacing entire panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Door Handle Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Exterior door handles breaking or becoming difficult to use.

    * Description/Symptoms: Pixels disappearing or fading on the radio display or climate control display.
    * Solution: Replacement of the entire display or repair by a specialized electronics repair shop.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2000 Buick Regal, while generally reliable, has several common issues related to its age and design. Engine issues like intake manifold leaks and supercharger coupler failure (on the L67) are relatively common and can range from moderate to significant in cost. Transmission problems with the 4T65-E, particularly related to the pressure control solenoid and torque converter clutch, can be costly to repair. Other issues such as suspension wear, electrical faults, and rust are common for a vehicle of this age and can contribute to ongoing maintenance costs. The climate control actuator and display issues can be frustrating but are generally not critical to the car's operation. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in maintenance costs when considering a 2000 Buick Regal.
