The 2015 Buick Verano is a compact sedan known for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and upscale features. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 180 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a turbocharged 2.0L inline-4 producing 250 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Verano's smooth ride and luxurious feel for its price point. Common complaints include the sometimes sluggish performance of the base engine and some minor electrical issues.
