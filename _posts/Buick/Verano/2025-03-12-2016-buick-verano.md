The 2016 Buick Verano is a compact sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a well-appointed interior. It came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 180 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 250 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Verano's quiet cabin, smooth ride, and upscale features for its price point. Common dislikes include its somewhat uninspired styling and the 2.4L engine's perceived lack of power.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine. This can manifest as the need to add oil frequently between oil changes, often with no visible leaks. Low oil levels can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed, including potential catalytic converter damage and eventual engine failure.
    *   Solution: GM released Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) #16-NA-019 addressing this issue for various models, including the Verano. The TSB outlines a revised oil level indicator and diagnostic procedures. In some cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary to correct the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and extent of repairs, from software updates to piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The evaporative emissions (EVAP) purge valve can fail, causing a check engine light with codes such as P0496 (Evaporative Emission System Flow During Non-Purge). Symptoms include a rough idle, difficulty starting, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Wastegate Actuator Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The wastegate actuator can fail, causing poor performance or boost issues. This can lead to a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the wastegate actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement of the transmission. This can be more pronounced at higher mileage.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate the problem. In more severe instances, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear or failure of the struts/shocks, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive noise when going over bumps.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks. It's recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) to ensure even handling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (per axle)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and isolating the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various circuits and components to identify the culprit. Once identified, the faulty component needs to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (simple fix) - $500+ (complex diagnosis and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Buick IntelliLink infotainment system can sometimes experience glitches, freezes, or unresponsive touchscreens.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealer can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, the infotainment system unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the headliner fabric detaching from the backing and sagging, particularly in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Buick Verano can experience some issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most concerning is the potential for excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine, which can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, while less common, can also be expensive to address. Electrical gremlins like battery drain and infotainment system glitches can be frustrating. Overall, while not a universally problematic car, a thorough inspection, including checking the oil level and test driving for transmission smoothness, is highly recommended before purchasing a used 2016 Buick Verano.
