The 2014 Buick Verano is a compact sedan that offered a comfortable ride and a well-appointed interior for its class. While appreciated for its quiet cabin and smooth handling, the Verano had its share of reported issues. The 2014 model year came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 180 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 rated at 250 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally liked the Verano's upscale feel and fuel efficiency (particularly with the 2.4L engine), but some disliked the somewhat cramped rear seating and reported reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust might be observed. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored closely.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised piston ring design was implemented to address oil consumption issues. Other solutions include replacing valve stem seals or even replacing the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling or whining noises from the engine bay, check engine light activation.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Long crank to start, engine misfires, check engine light activation.
    *   Solution: Fuel pump replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or delayed shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or when downshifting. Transmission may hesitate before engaging a gear.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can sometimes resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, clunking noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dead Battery/Electrical Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or after a few days of inactivity. Difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the electrical drain (e.g., faulty module, accessory left on). Replace the battery if it's aged or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Faulty Window Regulator**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window moving slowly, or not at all. Grinding or other abnormal noises when operating the window.

**Summary**

The 2014 Buick Verano, while generally a comfortable and stylish compact sedan, had some reported issues, particularly related to engine oil consumption and turbocharger reliability (in the 2.0L turbo models). Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, were also noted. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue, but some repairs, like turbocharger replacement, can be relatively expensive. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially serious engine or transmission problems. Pre-purchase inspection and a thorough maintenance history review are highly recommended.
