The 2013 Buick Verano is a compact sedan that offers a blend of comfort and refinement. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine producing 180 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Verano for its quiet cabin, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. However, some common complaints include the less-than-thrilling acceleration of the base engine, smaller rear seat space compared to other compacts, and some reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Summary**

The 2013 Buick Verano, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to watch out for. The 2.4L engine's oil consumption is a potential concern, as is the possibility of turbocharger failure in the 2.0L turbo. Transmission issues, suspension noises, and electrical glitches in the infotainment system are also areas to inspect. The severity and cost of these issues can range from relatively minor repairs to more substantial expenses, making a pre-purchase inspection highly advisable.
