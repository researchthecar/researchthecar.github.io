### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Buick Verano generally presents a reliable profile, particularly with its standard 2.4L engine. The primary areas of concern tend to be associated with the more powerful 2.0L turbocharged engine, specifically regarding the turbocharger itself and potential oil leaks. The automatic transmission, while generally competent, can exhibit issues with shifting quality and occasional leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted but not universally prevalent. For those considering a 2014 Verano, opting for the naturally aspirated engine may offer a slightly more robust long-term ownership experience, though careful inspection and maintenance of any vehicle, especially those with the turbo option, are always recommended.
