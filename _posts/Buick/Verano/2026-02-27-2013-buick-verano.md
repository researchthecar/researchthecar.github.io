### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Buick Verano generally presents a reliable profile, particularly with its naturally aspirated 2.4L engine and manual transmission. The 2.0L turbocharged engine, while offering more performance, has a higher propensity for issues such as turbocharger problems and oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmission issues, primarily related to shifting quality, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are present but not overwhelmingly common. For buyers prioritizing reliability, the naturally aspirated engine and manual transmission combination is recommended. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging symptoms, especially with the turbocharged engine, are key to ensuring a positive ownership experience.
