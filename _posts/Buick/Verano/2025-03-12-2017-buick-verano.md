Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2017 Buick Verano, organized by category and powertrain option.

The 2017 Buick Verano is a compact sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a well-appointed interior. It came with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 180 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 generating 250 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Verano for its quiet cabin and premium feel for its class. However, some criticisms include the smaller back seat for the compact sedan class and some reliability concerns reported.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the low oil pressure light illuminating or noticing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: The most common fix involves replacing the valve cover which incorporates the PCV valve. In some cases, more extensive repairs like piston ring replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, difficulty starting, and a possible fuel smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbo Inline-4**

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine bay, loss of power, check engine light. Could indicate a failing or damaged turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the source of the issue. If the turbo is faulty, replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Extended cranking time to start, rough idle, hesitation upon acceleration, check engine light.

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, hesitation when accelerating, particularly when cold.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change might help. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal wear may require more extensive repairs or a transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Summary**

The 2017 Buick Verano can be a comfortable and enjoyable car, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The 2.4L engine's oil consumption is a prevalent concern. The turbocharged engine can be prone to issues as well, but these issues are more costly to repair. Transmission issues can also be a problem, but can be prevented by maintaining the transmission. Electrical issues can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose, with costs varying widely depending on the root cause. Overall, these issues range in severity and repair costs, and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended to assess the condition of any used Verano.
