### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Buick Verano generally presents a reliable profile, particularly with its standard 2.4L engine and transmission. The most commonly cited technical issues tend to be concentrated in the more powerful 2.0L turbocharged engine, specifically concerning the turbocharger and potential oil leaks, as well as some transmission-related concerns like harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and intermittent battery drain, are also noted. However, these issues are not universally reported and often fall within the expected range for a vehicle of this age. For prospective buyers, a thorough pre-purchase inspection, especially focusing on the powertrain and electrical systems if considering the turbo model, is recommended.
