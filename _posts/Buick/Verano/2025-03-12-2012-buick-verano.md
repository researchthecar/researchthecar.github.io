The 2012 Buick Verano is a compact sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a premium feel at an affordable price point. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 180 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 250 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People liked the Verano for its quiet cabin, comfortable seats, and available luxury features. Some criticisms included its somewhat uninspired styling and the base engine's lack of pep.
**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms may include needing to add oil every 1,000-3,000 miles, blue exhaust smoke, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve can help. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV valve) - $2,000+ (engine repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed. Symptoms may include a rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail prematurely, leading to a loss of power and potentially damaging the engine. Symptoms include a whistling or whining noise from the turbocharger, reduced acceleration, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, especially between certain gears. This can be caused by worn valve body components, low transmission fluid, or software issues.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission fluid flush or valve body replacement may be necessary. In some cases, a software update can address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $1,500+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt during acceleration, typically at lower speeds. This is often caused by degradation of the torque converter.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with a shudder fix additive might temporarily alleviate the issue. Replacement of the torque converter is the long-term solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (fluid flush + additive) - $1,000 - $2,000+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the struts/shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased wear on tires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may require specialized diagnostic equipment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio or infotainment system may experience glitches, freezes, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: A software update might resolve the issue. In some cases, the radio or infotainment unit needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (software update) - $300 - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows or door locks.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system. This can be caused by a faulty sensor, a disconnected connector, or a problem with the airbag control module.

**Summary**

The 2012 Buick Verano can experience a range of issues, with engine and transmission problems being the most significant in terms of potential cost and severity. Oil consumption and timing chain issues on the 2.4L engine, turbocharger failures on the 2.0L turbo, and harsh shifting in the 6-speed automatic transmission are common complaints. Electrical gremlins, suspension wear, and sunroof problems also occur. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be costly, making a thorough inspection and maintenance history review essential before purchasing a used 2012 Verano.
