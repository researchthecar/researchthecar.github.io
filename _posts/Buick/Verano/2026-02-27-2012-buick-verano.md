### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Buick Verano presents a mixed reliability profile. While its core mechanical components like the suspension and general interior/exterior are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with oil consumption and timing chains on the 2.4L engine, and turbocharger concerns on the 2.0L turbo variant. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. Regular maintenance, especially monitoring oil levels and timely fluid changes for the transmission, is crucial for mitigating these potential problems and ensuring a more reliable ownership experience.
