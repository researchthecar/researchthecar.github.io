### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Buick Allure demonstrates a generally acceptable reliability profile for its class, with its powertrain options being the most robust aspect. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues that can arise, particularly within the electrical system, such as Body Control Module failures and infotainment system glitches. Transmission reliability varies by type, with the 6-speed automatic showing a higher incidence of control module and valve body problems. Suspension components like strut mounts and control arm bushings are also noted for wear. While the exterior is largely trouble-free, interior climate control actuators can be a point of failure. Addressing these potential issues proactively can contribute to a more positive ownership experience.
