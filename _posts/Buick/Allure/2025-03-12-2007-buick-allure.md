The 2007 Buick Allure (also sold as the LaCrosse in the US) is a comfortable, mid-size sedan known for its smooth ride and spacious interior. Engine options included a 3.8L Series III V6 (200 hp, 230 lb-ft torque), a 3.6L DOHC V6 (240 hp, 225 lb-ft torque), and a 3.8L Supercharged Series III V6 (240 hp, 280 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 4T65E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's quiet cabin and comfortable seats. Common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling and average fuel economy for the segment.

**Summary**

The 2007 Buick Allure has a mix of potential issues. Engine problems can range from relatively minor (intake manifold leaks on the 3.8L) to more significant (timing chain wear on the 3.6L). Transmission issues with the 4T65E are also common across all engine options. Suspension and electrical problems are fairly typical for a car of this age. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but owners should be prepared for potential expenses ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to over $1000 for major engine or transmission work.
