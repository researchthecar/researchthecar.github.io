The 2005 Buick Allure (also sold as the Buick LaCrosse in the US) is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Engine options include a 3.8L Series III V6 producing around 200 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 (available in later model years) producing around 240 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the smooth ride and affordability of the Allure, but some dislike the somewhat dated styling and the occasional reliability issues common to vehicles of this age.

**Engine**

**3.8L Series III V6**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, overheating, white smoke from exhaust, rough idle.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Ensure correct torque specifications are followed during installation.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, poor fuel economy, check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace faulty fuel injector(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per injector (includes labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Stalling, starting issues, check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

* **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise on startup, check engine light, poor performance, potential engine damage. (Although technically more common in later years with the 3.6L, it can occur in 2005 models that might have had engine replacements at some point.)
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioners. This is a major repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4T65-E Four-Speed Automatic**

* **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifts between gears, transmission slipping, delayed engagement, check engine light.
    * Solution: Fluid flush and filter change *may* resolve minor issues.  Otherwise, transmission rebuild or replacement is likely necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change $100 - $200; Rebuild $1500 - $3500+; Replacement $2000 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration, transmission slipping.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ (often done with transmission service)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise when going over bumps, particularly at low speeds, excessive body roll during cornering.
    * Solution: Replace the front strut mounts.  It's often recommended to replace the struts at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per side (including struts and mounts).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear of the car sits lower than normal, especially when loaded, reduced ride quality.
    * Solution: Replace rear shocks or struts, and possibly rear springs, depending on the cause of the sagging.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (shocks/struts only); $400 - $800+ (springs and shocks/struts)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window moving slowly or not at all, grinding noise when operating the window.
    * Solution: Replace the power window regulator and motor assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning (speedometer, fuel gauge, etc.), lights flickering or not working.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Repair $200 - $400+; Replacement $300 - $600+ (used) or higher for new/remanufactured.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on rocker panels, lower door edges, and around wheel wells.
    * Solution: Rust repair and repainting, or panel replacement depending on the severity.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per panel depending on severity and shop.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Headliner Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaching from the roof and sagging down.
    * Solution: Replace the headliner fabric or the entire headliner board.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Climate Control Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clicking noise behind the dashboard, inconsistent air temperature from vents, inability to control airflow direction.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty climate control actuator(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per actuator, depending on location and accessibility.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Buick Allure, while generally a comfortable and affordable vehicle, is subject to common issues associated with age. Engine problems, particularly intake manifold leaks on the 3.8L and potential timing chain issues on the 3.6L, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, such as hard shifting and torque converter failure, are also a concern. Suspension and electrical issues, while less severe, can add to the overall maintenance costs. Rust is another potential issue, especially in regions with harsh winters. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems before purchasing and factor in potential repair costs.
