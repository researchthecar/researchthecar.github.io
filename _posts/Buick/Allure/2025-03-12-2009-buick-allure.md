The 2009 Buick Allure, also known as the Buick LaCrosse in some markets, is a comfortable and spacious sedan known for its smooth ride and quiet cabin. The 2009 model year offered several engine options: a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 169 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, a 3.8L Series III V6 producing 200 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L DOHC V6 producing 255 horsepower and 217 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, or a 6-speed automatic transmission with the 3.0L DOHC V6. Owners often praised the Allure for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and value for money. However, some criticized its somewhat bland styling, and the fuel economy of the larger V6 engines. Common dislikes include electrical glitches and occasional issues with the transmission.
