The 2010 Buick Allure (also sold as the Buick LaCrosse in the US) is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Engine options include a 2.4L Ecotec inline-4 producing 169 hp and 163 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 producing 255 hp and 217 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L V6 producing 280 hp and 259 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Allure for its smooth ride and quiet cabin, but common complaints revolve around electrical issues and some drivetrain concerns.

**Summary**

The 2010 Buick Allure, while generally a comfortable and reliable vehicle, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption (particularly with the 2.4L) and timing chain issues on both the 2.4L and 3.6L V6s can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, such as power window failures and battery drain problems, are also relatively frequent. While some issues, like strut mount failure and sunroof leaks, are common on many vehicles of this age, the potential for engine and transmission repairs should be factored into the purchase decision. The severity and cost of these potential repairs range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, so a thorough inspection is recommended before buying a used 2010 Buick Allure.
