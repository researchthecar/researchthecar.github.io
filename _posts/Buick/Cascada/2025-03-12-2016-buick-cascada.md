The 2016 Buick Cascada is a stylish and comfortable convertible that offers a smooth ride and decent fuel economy. It comes equipped with a single engine option, the 1.6L Turbocharged inline-4 producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. All models are equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Cascada's attractive design, comfortable interior, and open-air driving experience. Common complaints include a somewhat cramped rear seat, limited cargo space, and less-than-sporty handling compared to some competitors.
