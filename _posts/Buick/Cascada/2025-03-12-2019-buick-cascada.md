The 2019 Buick Cascada is a stylish and comfortable convertible known for its relatively affordable price point and comfortable ride. It comes equipped with a single engine and transmission option, a 1.6L turbocharged inline-4 producing 200 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Cascada for its smooth ride, quiet cabin (for a convertible), and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated styling, limited rear seat space, and lack of modern driver-assistance features.

**Engine**

**1.6L Turbocharged Inline-4 (LTG)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: The cause of excessive oil consumption is variable. Some owners have success switching to a different brand of oil or a higher viscosity. In more severe cases, piston ring failure may be suspected, which would require an engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported turbocharger failure, leading to loss of power, unusual noises (whining, whistling), and potential check engine lights.
    * Solution: Turbocharger replacement is often necessary. Inspecting oil lines and ensuring proper lubrication is crucial for preventing recurrence.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6T40)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh or erratic shifting between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Transmission slipping, where the engine revs without a corresponding increase in speed, has also been reported.
    *   Solution: In many cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate minor issues. However, more severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or even a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (radio, navigation, etc.) can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a system reboot.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In other cases, replacement of the infotainment module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Convertible Top Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The convertible top may fail to operate correctly, getting stuck mid-cycle, or not opening/closing completely. This can be due to sensor issues, hydraulic pump failures, or problems with the mechanical linkages.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is critical to pinpoint the source of the problem. Solutions range from sensor replacement to hydraulic pump repair/replacement or mechanical linkage adjustments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may stop working on one or both front seats. This is often due to a break in the heating element within the seat.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the seat heating element is the typical solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per seat
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the convertible top seals, particularly in heavy rain or car washes.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn or damaged weatherstripping and seals. Adjustments to the top mechanism can also help improve sealing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Buick Cascada has a few potential issues that buyers should be aware of. The most concerning are excessive oil consumption in the engine and harsh shifting in the transmission. The convertible top and electrical issues can also be costly to repair. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and the cost to fix them can vary widely depending on the specific problem. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
