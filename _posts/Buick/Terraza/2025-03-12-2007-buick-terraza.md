The 2007 Buick Terraza was a mid-size crossover SUV that offered seating for up to seven passengers. It was generally praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and versatility. Some owners disliked its bland styling and less-than-stellar fuel economy. The 2007 Terraza came with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.9L V6 producing 240 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
