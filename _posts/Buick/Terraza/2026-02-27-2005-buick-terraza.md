### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Buick Terraza presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly the 3.5L V6 engine's intake manifold gaskets and camshaft position sensors, and the 4-speed automatic transmission's torque converter and solenoids. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, and premature alternator failure are also noted. On the exterior, rust can be a concern in certain climates, and headlight lenses may degrade. The interior's HVAC blend doors and power sliding door mechanisms are also potential weak points. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair costs to maintain the vehicle effectively.
