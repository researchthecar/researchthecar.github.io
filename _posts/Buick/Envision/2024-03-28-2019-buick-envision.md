**Introduction:**

The 2019 Buick Envision is a compact crossover SUV that offers a comfortable and spacious interior, advanced safety features, and a range of engine and transmission options. It is powered by a standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine or an optional 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The Envision is praised for its refined ride quality, luxurious interior, and intuitive infotainment system. However, it also faces criticism for its sluggish performance with the base engine, limited cargo capacity, and occasionally stiff suspension.

**Engine**

**2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption:** Some vehicles experience excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. This issue often requires replacing the piston rings or the entire engine, costing $3,000 - $6,000+.
* **Timing Chain Noise:** Certain vehicles with high mileage may develop a rattling or ticking noise from the timing chain. The timing chain tensioner may need to be replaced, costing $1,000 - $2,000.
* **Coolant Leak:** A defective coolant hose can cause coolant leaks, resulting in overheating and potential engine damage. The hose needs to be replaced, costing $200 - $400.

**2.0-Liter Turbocharged Four-Cylinder Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** Some vehicles experience turbocharger failures, leading to reduced power, increased fuel consumption, and engine noises. Replacing the turbocharger can cost $2,500 - $4,000.
* **Engine Misfires:** Under certain driving conditions, the engine may experience misfires, resulting in rough idling and reduced power. This issue often requires replacing the ignition coils or spark plugs, costing $200 - $600.

**Transmission**

**Nine-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Hesitation:** Some vehicles experience hesitation or delays when shifting gears, particularly when shifting from first to second gear. This issue may be resolved by updating the transmission software, costing $100 - $200.
* **Transmission Slipping:** In rare cases, the transmission may slip when shifting, causing loss of power and hesitation. This issue may require rebuilding or replacing the transmission, costing $2,000 - $5,000.

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sagging:** Over time, the rear suspension components may sag, leading to a lower ride height and uneven tire wear. Replacing the rear springs or shocks can cost $500 - $1,000.
* **Front Strut Noise:** Some vehicles develop a knocking or rattling noise from the front struts, particularly over rough roads. Replacing the struts can resolve this issue, costing $600 - $1,200.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Certain vehicles may experience excessive battery drain, leading to dead batteries and starting problems. This issue may be caused by a parasitic electrical draw or a defective battery, costing $150 - $400 to fix.
* **Alternator Failure:** Some vehicles may experience alternator failures, leading to charging problems and potential battery damage. Replacing the alternator can cost $500 - $1,000.

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** In certain weather conditions, the headlight housings may accumulate condensation, impairing visibility. This issue is typically resolved by replacing the headlight assemblies, costing $500 - $1,000.
* **Rust on Body Panels:** Some vehicles have experienced premature rust formation on body panels, particularly around the wheel wells and undercarriage. This issue may require professional rust repair or panel replacement, costing $1,000 - $3,000+.

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Rattle:** Vehicles with a panoramic sunroof may experience rattling or squeaking noises, particularly over bumps or rough roads. Adjusting the alignment or replacing the sunroof seal may resolve this issue, costing $500 - $1,000.
* **Dashboard Creaks and Rattles:** Some vehicles develop creaks or rattles from the dashboard or interior panels. This issue may require disassembling the interior and tightening loose components, costing $200 - $500.

**Summary:**

The 2019 Buick Envision generally has good reliability, but some specific issues to watch out for include excessive oil consumption, turbocharger failures, suspension wear, electrical problems, and certain interior rattles. The severity and cost of the issues vary, with some minor issues being inexpensive to fix, while major engine or transmission problems can be more costly. It is important to have the vehicle regularly serviced and inspected to identify and address potential issues early on.
