The 2020 Buick Envision is a compact SUV offering a blend of comfort and practicality. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L four-cylinder engine producing 197 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine generating 252 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Envision's quiet cabin, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common criticisms include the somewhat uninspired styling and the less-than-stellar fuel economy for the base engine.

**Summary**

The 2020 Buick Envision experiences a range of issues, from minor infotainment glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. The 2.0L turbocharged engine is more prone to issues than the 2.5L engine. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as engine repairs or transmission valve body replacements, can be costly. The potential for oil consumption and turbocharger failure on the 2.0L engines should be carefully considered when evaluating a used 2020 Envision, with appropriate maintenance records reviewed if available.
