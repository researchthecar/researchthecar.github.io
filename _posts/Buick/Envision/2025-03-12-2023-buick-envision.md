**Summary**

The 2023 Buick Envision appears to have a mix of minor and potentially more significant issues. The most concerning issues relate to the engine (excessive oil consumption) and transmission (harsh shifting), as these could lead to costly repairs if left unaddressed. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera are also common, though typically less severe and expensive to fix. Interior rattles and exterior leaks, while annoying, are often considered less critical. Overall, a thorough inspection and careful consideration of these potential problems are advised for prospective buyers.
