The 2019 Buick Envision is a compact SUV that offers a blend of comfort and practicality. The two engine options available for the 2019 Envision include a 2.5L inline-4 engine producing 197 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission for the 2.5L and a 9-speed automatic transmission for the 2.0L. Owners often appreciate the Envision's quiet cabin, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Some common dislikes include the somewhat uninspiring exterior styling, occasionally sluggish acceleration with the base engine, and concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the PCV valve or valve stem seals has helped. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, abnormal engine noises (whining, hissing), check engine light illumination, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Ensure proper lubrication and address any underlying causes of failure (e.g., oil leaks, contamination).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 2.5L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. Hesitation when accelerating or shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Some owners have reported that a transmission fluid flush or reprogramming the TCM (Transmission Control Module) can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (Paired with 2.0L Engine)**

*   **Shifting Problems/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating, rough shifting between gears, or a noticeable clunking sound when shifting.
    *   Solution: Begin by checking and possibly replacing the transmission fluid. Then, have a qualified mechanic inspect the transmission control module to see if reprogramming is required. If the issues continue, it may be necessary to replace the valve body or the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Buick Envision faces a range of potential issues, with engine and transmission problems being the most significant. The 2.0L Turbo engine is subject to potential turbo failure, while the 9-speed transmission that it is paired with is prone to shifting issues. The 2.5L engine is prone to excessive oil consumption. Electrical and interior issues, such as infotainment problems and sunroof malfunctions, are also present but generally less severe and less costly to repair. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial to maintaining the vehicle's reliability and avoiding more extensive repairs.
