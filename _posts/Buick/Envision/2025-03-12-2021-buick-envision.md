Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2021 Buick Envision, organized by category and engine/transmission options. The 2021 Buick Envision marked the start of its second generation, offering a more refined and technologically advanced vehicle compared to its predecessor. The standard engine is a 2.0L Turbocharged inline-4 producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Some owners praise the Envision for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and user-friendly technology. However, some criticisms include the somewhat uninspired driving experience, and some reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (LSY)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may manifest as a low oil warning light or noticeable oil depletion on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: GM has released updated PCV valve designs and piston ring designs to address this. Replacing the affected components may reduce oil consumption. Some cases may require engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair, whether PCV, Piston rings, or Full Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature turbocharger failure, leading to reduced engine power, unusual noises (whining or whistling), and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement is usually necessary. Diagnose and address any underlying issues (e.g., oil starvation, boost leaks) to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (9TXX)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation or delayed response when accelerating is also reported.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update (reprogramming the transmission control module - TCM) can improve shift quality. In other cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $500 - $6,000+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power while accelerating, engine revving without corresponding increase in speed, and delayed engagement of gears.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is critical to determine the root cause (e.g., low fluid, worn clutches, valve body issues). Repair or replacement of the transmission is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (Fluid Top-off) - $500 - $6,000+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen may freeze, become unresponsive to touch, or spontaneously reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Buick can sometimes resolve these issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the infotainment unit may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $500 - $1,500+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may display a blank screen, distorted image, or fail to activate when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. Software updates or camera replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (wiring fix) - $300 - $800+ (Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof area, potentially damaging the headliner or interior components.
    *   Solution: Inspect and clean the sunroof drain tubes to ensure they are not clogged. Resealing the sunroof or replacing weather stripping may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Automatic Liftgate Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly, operate erratically, or make unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts, motor, and sensors. Replacement of faulty components or reprogramming the liftgate control module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters failing to function properly.

**Summary:**

The 2021 Buick Envision has several potential issues to be aware of. Engine issues, specifically oil consumption and turbocharger problems, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, like harsh shifting or slipping, can also impact the driving experience and require significant repairs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and backup camera can be frustrating, while exterior issues like sunroof leaks and liftgate problems may lead to water damage or inconvenience. Interior issues like the seat heaters and excessive rattling could be frustrating for drivers. The severity and cost of these issues vary, so prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems.
