The 2016 Buick Envision marked the vehicle's inaugural year, blending compact SUV practicality with Buick's reputation for near-luxury refinement. It came standard with a 2.5L inline-4 engine producing 197 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. An optional 2.0L turbocharged inline-4, generating 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, was also available, and was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Envision for its comfortable ride, quiet cabin, and stylish design. Criticisms frequently centered on the smaller-than-expected cargo space, some quirky infotainment features, and some reports of reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. This can manifest as needing to add oil between service intervals, a low oil level warning light illuminating, or in severe cases, engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: The first step is to monitor oil consumption closely. A dealer inspection may involve performing an oil consumption test. Depending on the results, the fix could range from replacing the PCV valve to address crankcase pressure issues, to more extensive repairs involving piston rings or even engine replacement in the worst cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (PCV Valve) - $3,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the engine bay, loss of power, reduced fuel economy, and/or a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is required to confirm turbocharger failure. Replacement of the turbocharger unit is generally the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body or individual solenoids within the transmission may need replacement. In more severe cases, a full transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400 (Fluid Flush/Filter) - $1,000+ (Valve Body) - $3,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or restarts unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset by holding the power button. If the problem continues, a software update from the dealer may be required. In some instances, the entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Reset/Update) - $500-$1,500+ (Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle battery drains quickly, resulting in difficulty starting the engine or a completely dead battery. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: A mechanic needs to perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the battery drain. Once identified, the faulty component can be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Diagnosis) - $100 - $500+ (Repair/Replacement of Faulty Component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate fails to open or close properly, makes unusual noises, or stops mid-cycle.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts, motor, and latch mechanism for damage or wear. Replacement of the affected component is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$800+ (depending on the part)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin from the sunroof area, often staining the headliner or soaking the seats.
    *   Solution: Clean the sunroof drain tubes to remove any debris. If the problem persists, the sunroof seal may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (Drain Cleaning) - $200 - $500+ (Seal Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **AC not blowing cold air**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AC is blowing warm air when it should be blowing cold air
    *   Solution: A mechanic needs to perform an AC test to identify the source of the problem and repair or replace the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Diagnosis) - $100 - $500+ (Repair/Replacement of Faulty Component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Buick Envision, while offering a comfortable and stylish driving experience, does have some reported issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly turbocharger failure in the 2.0L and harsh shifting with the 6-speed automatic, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and battery drain are also common complaints. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be significant and potentially lead to substantial repair bills. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
