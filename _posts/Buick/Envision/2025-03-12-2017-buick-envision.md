The 2017 Buick Envision is a compact crossover SUV that offers a blend of comfort, practicality, and premium features. Two engine options were available: a 2.5L inline-4 producing 197 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 generating 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Envision's quiet cabin, comfortable ride, and available features like a panoramic sunroof and advanced safety technology. However, some criticisms include the somewhat uninspired styling, a less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors, and reported issues with the infotainment system.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption between oil changes, sometimes requiring topping off the oil level. Symptoms may include the low oil pressure light illuminating or the engine running rough due to low oil.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the dealer may perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of consumption. Potential solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine, loss of power, check engine light illuminating. This may be caused by excessive wear or failure of the turbocharger bearings.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or rough shifting between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Some owners report a "clunking" noise during shifts or that the transmission seems to "slip" out of gear momentarily.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking transmission fluid level and condition, performing a transmission flush, or in more severe cases, valve body replacement, solenoid replacement, or a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Creaking or clunking noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. This is most commonly attributed to worn or dry suspension bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected bushings, such as the rear sway bar bushings or control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash and restart unexpectedly. This can affect navigation, audio, climate controls, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the infotainment system, or in severe cases, replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+ (Software updates may be free at the dealer)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle battery drains quickly, leading to starting problems, especially after sitting for a short period. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component that is not shutting down properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the faulty electrical component causing the parasitic draw, or battery replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks - Sunroof/Moonroof**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, often near the headliner or A-pillars, after rain or car washes. This is often due to clogged sunroof/moonroof drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Clearing the drain tubes of debris and ensuring they are properly connected.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on complexity of blockage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seat heater either stops working, doesn't heat up, or gets dangerously hot.
    * Solution: Replacing the seat heater element or the seat heater control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Buick Envision presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While many owners enjoy the comfort and features, problems like excessive oil consumption, transmission issues, and infotainment system malfunctions can be concerning. The severity and cost of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to more significant expenses. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing, paying close attention to the condition of the engine, transmission, and electrical systems.
