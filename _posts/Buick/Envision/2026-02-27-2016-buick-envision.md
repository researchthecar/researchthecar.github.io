### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Buick Envision presents a generally reliable profile, with the 2.4L engine and standard chassis components showing few reported issues. The more potent 2.0L turbocharged engine, while offering better performance, has seen some reports of turbocharger issues and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. Transmission concerns, primarily related to hesitation or shuddering, are also noted and may require professional attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are areas to monitor. Overall, the Envision offers a comfortable and feature-rich experience, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific powertrain and electrical components that have a higher likelihood of requiring attention over time.
