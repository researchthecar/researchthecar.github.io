### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Buick Envision demonstrates a mixed reliability profile. The 2.5L engine and standard chassis components are generally robust. However, the 2.0L turbocharged engine has been associated with potential oil leaks and turbocharger issues, which can be costly to repair. The 6-speed automatic transmission may experience hesitation or shuddering, requiring attention. Electrical concerns, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection, especially for models equipped with the turbocharged engine.
