The 2024 Buick Envision is a compact SUV that blends comfort, style, and technology. It is powered by a single engine option: a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Envision's quiet and comfortable ride, upscale interior, and user-friendly technology. Criticisms frequently revolve around the somewhat uninspired driving dynamics and the lack of a more powerful engine option.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged I4 (LGE)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption between oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than normal, low oil level warnings, and potentially blueish smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. In some cases, switching to a different oil viscosity or brand can help. In more severe cases, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test to diagnose the root cause, which could involve piston ring replacement or other internal engine repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $3,000+ (major engine repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (9TXX)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifting, particularly during low-speed acceleration or downshifting. The transmission may feel hesitant or jerky.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, it may require more extensive diagnostics and potentially replacement of valve body components or other transmission parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (Software update) - $1,000+ (Transmission repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing or Glitching**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system screen may freeze, become unresponsive, or exhibit glitchy behavior. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer can often resolve infotainment system issues. In some cases, a system reset or replacement of the infotainment module may be necessary.

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
