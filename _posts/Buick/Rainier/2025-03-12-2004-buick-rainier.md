The 2004 Buick Rainier was a mid-size SUV offering a blend of comfort and capability. Available engine options included a 4.2L Inline-6 engine producing around 275 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 engine producing around 290 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4L60-E 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Rainier's smooth ride and comfortable interior but often cited its fuel economy and some reliability concerns as drawbacks.

**Summary**

The 2004 Buick Rainier presents a range of potential issues, from engine and transmission problems to electrical and suspension concerns. Engine issues range from relatively inexpensive fixes like camshaft actuators and knock sensors, to more costly repairs like oil consumption. Transmission issues, particularly slipping, can lead to expensive rebuilds or replacements. Suspension issues with the air ride system (if equipped) can also be costly. Electrical glitches with the instrument cluster and BCM are also common. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive to address, making a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing a used 2004 Buick Rainier.
