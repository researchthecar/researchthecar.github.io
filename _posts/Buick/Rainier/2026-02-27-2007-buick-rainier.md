### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Buick Rainier presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the 4.2L inline-six, are generally robust, though intake manifold gasket leaks and oil cooler line issues can occur. The 5.3L V8 is powerful but susceptible to Active Fuel Management (AFM) related lifter problems. Transmission issues, primarily with the 4L60-E, often involve the torque converter clutch or solenoids. Suspension components like wheel bearings and the optional rear air suspension compressor are known failure points. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or alternator, can also arise. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair costs, especially concerning the powertrain and electrical systems.
