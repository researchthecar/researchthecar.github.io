### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Buick Rainier is a generally dependable SUV, particularly if equipped with the robust inline-six engine. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks on both engines, and specific concerns like AFM lifter problems on the V8. The 4L60-E transmission, while common, can develop issues with its clutch packs or solenoids. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and ignition switch, can be frustrating. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior climate control components like blend door actuators are known failure points. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate these potential repair costs and ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
