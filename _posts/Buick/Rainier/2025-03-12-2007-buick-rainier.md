The 2007 Buick Rainier is a mid-size SUV that offers a blend of comfort and utility. Available engine options include the 4.2L inline-6, producing 291 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, and the 5.3L V8, generating 302 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Rainier's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and quiet cabin. However, some common complaints include issues with the electrical system, suspension components, and fuel economy, especially with the V8 engine.

**Engine**

**4.2L Inline-6**

*   **Failed Camshaft Actuator Solenoid**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine runs rough, check engine light illuminates, and loss of power. The camshaft actuator solenoid may become clogged or fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft actuator solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250

*   **Faulty Engine Cooling Fan Clutch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine overheating, especially during hot weather or when towing. The cooling fan clutch may fail to engage properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the engine cooling fan clutch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between oil changes. May be related to the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system.
    *   Solution: Disable AFM system. Replace valve cover with updated version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+

*   **Failed Oil Pressure Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous low oil pressure readings on the dashboard gauge, or a "check engine light" or "check gauges" message. Sensor may fail prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, especially when cold. Could be due to low fluid, worn solenoids, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Flush transmission fluid, replace solenoids, or rebuild/replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush), $300 - $800 (solenoids), $2000 - $4000+ (rebuild/replace)

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension sags, compressor runs constantly, or suspension warning light illuminates. Compressor may fail due to age or leaks in the air lines/bags.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor, repair air leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear. Ball joints and tie rod ends may wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Ignition Switch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle stalls unexpectedly, difficulty starting, or electrical accessories malfunction. The ignition switch may develop internal faults.
    *   Solution: Replace the ignition switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows or door locks. Can be caused by faulty switches, wiring problems, or failed actuators.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises behind the dashboard, inability to control temperature or airflow, or inconsistent temperature output. The climate control actuators may fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty climate control actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Summary**

The 2007 Buick Rainier presents a mix of mechanical and electrical issues. Engine problems range from relatively inexpensive sensor replacements to more costly AFM-related oil consumption issues in the V8 models. Transmission problems, if they occur, can be significant and expensive to repair. Suspension issues related to the air suspension (if equipped) and worn components are also common. Electrical issues, particularly with the ignition switch, can be concerning. Rust can affect the exterior, reducing its overall value. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and budget for potential repairs. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the vehicle's maintenance history and condition.
