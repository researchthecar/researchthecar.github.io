**5.7L V8**

* **Head Gasket Failure:** Blown head gaskets can result in coolant leaks, overheating, and engine damage. Requires replacement of head gaskets and associated components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500+
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Leaking intake manifold gaskets can cause vacuum leaks, rough idle, and reduced engine performance. Replacement of intake manifold gaskets is necessary. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic 4L60**

* **Transmission Slipping:** Internal transmission components may wear out over time, causing slipping and delayed shifts. Requires repair or replacement of transmission components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500+
* **TCC Solenoid Failure:** A faulty TCC solenoid can cause the transmission to shift erratically or fail to engage. Requires replacement of TCC solenoid. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500

**Interior**

* **Dash Cluster Failure:** The dash cluster may malfunction, resulting in inaccurate readings or inoperability. Replacement of the dash cluster or its components is required. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500+

**Summary**

The 1991 Buick Commercial Chassis is a capable work vehicle but is not without its issues. Engine and transmission problems can be costly to repair, and suspension and electrical issues can affect the vehicle's reliability and safety. Interior problems are relatively minor and less expensive to fix. Overall, the severity and cost of the issues vary depending on the specific problem encountered.
