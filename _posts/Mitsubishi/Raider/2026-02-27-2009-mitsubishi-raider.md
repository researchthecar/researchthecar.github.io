### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mitsubishi Raider presents a mixed reliability profile. The 4.7L V8 engine, while powerful, is more prone to significant issues like cylinder head problems and oil sludge compared to the 3.7L V6, which can suffer from oil leaks and spark plug issues. The 5-speed automatic transmission generally holds up better than the 4-speed automatic, which can experience harsh shifting and overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the instrument cluster and window regulators, are also noted. Overall, the Raider is a functional truck, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas of concern and factor in potential repair costs, especially with the larger V8 engine and 4-speed transmission.
