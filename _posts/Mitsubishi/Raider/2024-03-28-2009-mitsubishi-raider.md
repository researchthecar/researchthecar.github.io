The 2009 Mitsubishi Raider is a mid-size pickup truck that offers a blend of rugged capability and everyday practicality. It was available with two engine and transmission options:

* 3.7L SOHC V6 (202 hp, 250 lb-ft torque)
* 4.7L SOHC V8 (302 hp, 370 lb-ft torque)

**Engine**

**3.7L SOHC V6**
* **Timing Belt Failure:** Premature wear or failure of the timing belt can result in catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include skipped timing, engine misfires, and loss of power. Replacement of the belt, tensioner, and idler pulley is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can cause vacuum leaks, rough idle, and decreased engine performance. Replacement of the gasket is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1000
* **Knock Sensor Failure:** A malfunctioning knock sensor can result in engine pinging and decreased power. Replacement of the knock sensor is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400

**4.7L SOHC V8**

**Summary:**

The 2009 Mitsubishi Raider offers decent performance for everyday use. However, it faces some reliability issues, particularly with the timing belt on the V6 engine and the solenoids in the automatic transmission. These issues can be costly to repair, impacting the overall ownership experience. Potential buyers should carefully consider these potential problems before purchasing this vehicle.
