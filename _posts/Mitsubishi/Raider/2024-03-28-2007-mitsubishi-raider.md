**Introduction:**

The 2007 Mitsubishi Raider is a mid-size pickup truck that was produced from 2006 to 2009. It was available with either a 3.7-liter V6 engine (202 horsepower, 225 lb-ft of torque) or a 4.7-liter V8 engine (230 horsepower, 293 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic for the V6 engine and a 6-speed automatic for the V8 engine. Drivers appreciate the Raider's powerful engines, spacious cabin, and rugged exterior, however, it has been criticized for its limited fuel economy and some reliability issues.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include overheating, loss of coolant, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to jump and potentially damage the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**4.7L V8**
* **Head gasket failure:** The head gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil to leak into the cylinders. Symptoms include overheating, loss of coolant, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the head gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Camshaft sensor failure:** The camshaft sensor can fail, causing the engine to run poorly or not start at all. Symptoms include a rough idle, loss of power, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the camshaft sensor. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400

**Transmission**

**5-speed Automatic**
* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip when shifting gears, causing a loss of power. Symptoms include a delay in acceleration and a rough shift. The solution is to replace the transmission. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing the transmission to overheat and lose power. Symptoms include a burning smell, reduced acceleration, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the torque converter. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**6-speed Automatic**
* **Valve body failure:** The valve body can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. Symptoms include a delay in shifting, harsh shifts, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the valve body. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Solenoid failure:** The solenoids can fail, causing the transmission to shift improperly. Symptoms include a delayed shift, slipping, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the solenoids. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+

**Suspension**

* **Leaf spring breakage:** The leaf springs can break, causing the rear of the vehicle to sag. Symptoms include a noticeable drop in ride height, uneven tire wear, and a rough ride. The solution is to replace the leaf springs. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Shock absorber failure:** The shock absorbers can fail, causing the vehicle to bounce excessively and handle poorly. Symptoms include a rough ride, poor handling, and a loss of stability. The solution is to replace the shock absorbers. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to drain and the vehicle to lose power. Symptoms include a dim or flickering dashboard, difficulty starting the engine, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Battery failure:** The battery can fail, causing the vehicle to lose power and not start. Symptoms include a slow or no crank when starting the engine, a check engine light, and dim or flickering lights. The solution is to replace the battery. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200+

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The frame and body panels can be prone to rust, especially in areas where road salt is used. Symptoms include visible rust spots, peeling paint, and holes in the metal. The solution is to treat and prevent rust by applying rust-resistant coatings and regularly cleaning the undercarriage. Estimated cost to fix: varies depending on the extent of the damage
* **Tailgate cable failure:** The tailgate cable can fail, causing the tailgate to fall open. Symptoms include an inability to open or close the tailgate properly and a rattling noise. The solution is to replace the tailgate cable. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+

**Interior**

* **Climate control issues:** The climate control system can malfunction, causing the air conditioner or heater to not work properly. Symptoms include a lack of cooling or heating, a noisy fan, and a check engine light. The solution is to diagnose and repair the specific component that has failed. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $1,000+
* **Cruise control malfunction:** The cruise control system can malfunction, causing it to not work properly or to disengage unexpectedly. Symptoms include an inability to activate or set the cruise control, a sudden disengagement, and a check engine light. The solution is to diagnose and repair the specific component that has failed. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+

**Recalls:**

**Summary:**

The 2007 Mitsubishi Raider has some common issues that can be costly to repair, particularly engine and transmission problems. Potential issues include intake manifold gasket failure, timing chain tensioner failure, head gasket failure, transmission slipping, torque converter failure, leaf spring breakage, alternator failure, tailgate cable failure, climate control malfunctions, and cruise control malfunctions. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major problems that can compromise the vehicle's safety and drivability. It is recommended to research and consider these potential issues before purchasing a Mitsubishi Raider and to budget for potential repairs.
