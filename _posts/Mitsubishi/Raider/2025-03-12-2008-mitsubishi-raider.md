The 2008 Mitsubishi Raider is a mid-size pickup truck that was produced as a joint venture with Dodge, sharing a platform with the Dodge Dakota. The Raider offered a few engine options, including a 3.7L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7L V8 producing 290 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic (with the V6) and a 5-speed automatic (with the V8). Some owners appreciate the Raider's rugged styling and truck capabilities at a lower price point than some competitors. Common criticisms include its fuel economy and interior quality.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

* **Engine Knock/Tick**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable knocking or ticking sound emanating from the engine, especially when cold or under load. This may be caused by worn rod bearings, piston slap, or valve train issues.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific source of the noise. Repair may involve replacing rod bearings, pistons, or addressing valve train components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.7L V8**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common from various seals and gaskets, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Visible oil drips under the vehicle and a burning oil smell are common symptoms.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. Clean up any accumulated oil residue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the location and complexity of the repair).

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.7L V6)**
* **Erratic Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift into certain gears.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid change and filter replacement might help but can also cause the problems to get worse if that is the only thing wrong with it. In this case, a professional diagnosis of the issue may require the repair or replacement of the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150- $3000+ (depending on if it's a repair vs replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (paired with 4.7L V8)**

**Suspension**

* **Ball Joint Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and potential failure of ball joints, leading to clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
