The 2007 Mitsubishi Raider is a mid-size pickup truck that shares its platform with the Dodge Dakota. Engine options for this year include a 3.7L V6 producing 210 hp and 235 lb-ft of torque and a 4.7L V8 producing 230 hp and 290 lb-ft of torque. The V6 was typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Raider for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and aggressive styling. Common complaints include fuel economy, build quality, and parts availability.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

*   **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience a rough idle, stalling, or hesitation, particularly when cold. This can sometimes be attributed to the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve or the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS).
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty IAC valve or TPS can resolve the issue. Thoroughly cleaning the throttle body may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.7L V8**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil sludge buildup, especially in engines with less frequent oil changes. This can lead to decreased performance, engine knocking, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil can prevent sludge buildup. In severe cases, an engine flush or even engine disassembly and cleaning may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.7L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or a complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may help in minor cases. More severe cases may require a valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (paired with 4.7L V8)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the torque converter, resulting in shuddering, vibrations, or stalling at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter is typically the solution. In some cases, a transmission rebuild may be necessary.
