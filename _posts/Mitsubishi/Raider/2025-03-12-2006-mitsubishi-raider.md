**Summary**

The 2006 Mitsubishi Raider has some potential issues to be aware of. Engine problems can range from minor (throttle body cleaning) to moderate (oil leaks), and transmission issues can become costly if a rebuild or replacement is necessary. Suspension components are prone to wear and tear, while electrical issues like door lock actuators and instrument cluster malfunctions are not uncommon. Rust can also be a concern, especially in colder climates. While most of these repairs are common for a vehicle of this age, they can become costly if multiple issues arise.
