The 2009 Mitsubishi Raider is a mid-size pickup truck that shares its platform with the Dodge Dakota. Engine options for the 2009 Raider include a 3.7L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.7L V8 generating 290 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include a 4-speed automatic (with the V6) and a 5-speed automatic (with the V8). Owners often appreciate the Raider's rugged styling and truck-like capabilities, while some criticize its fuel economy and relatively outdated interior compared to competitors.

**3.7L V6**
*   **No Issues Found**

**4.7L V8**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various seals and gaskets, leading to oil consumption and potential engine damage if not addressed. Common leak areas include the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the location of the leak and labor costs)

*   **No Issues Found**

**5-Speed Automatic (paired with 4.7L V8)**
*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 5-speed automatic transmission, including harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, and delayed engagement. These issues can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body problems, or solenoid failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve a transmission fluid check, valve body inspection, or internal inspection for worn components. Repairs can range from fluid changes and valve body replacement to complete transmission rebuilds or replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and required repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Failure**

    *   Solution: Replacing the worn or damaged ball joints. It's often recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints on both sides to ensure even wear and proper alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may intermittently fail or stop working altogether. This can be due to a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause of the failure (motor, regulator, or switch) and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of instrument cluster failures, including gauges not working correctly or the cluster going completely blank. This can be caused by a faulty cluster unit or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to determine the root cause (wiring or cluster failure) and replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the cause and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**

**Summary**

The 2009 Mitsubishi Raider, while a capable truck, can be prone to some issues. The most significant concerns appear to be related to the 4.7L V8 engine with oil leaks and the 5-speed automatic transmission, potentially leading to costly repairs. Other issues include suspension components, electrical problems, rust, and interior defects. While these issues are not necessarily widespread, potential buyers should be aware of them and thoroughly inspect any used Raider before purchase, especially those equipped with the 4.7L V8.
