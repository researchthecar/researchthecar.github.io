# 2007 Mitsubishi Raider

### Overview
The 2007 Mitsubishi Raider, a rebadged Dodge Dakota, shares much of its mechanical DNA with its Chrysler counterpart. This means its reliability profile is largely influenced by the known performance of the Dakota's powertrains and chassis components from that era. While generally considered a capable and robust truck, certain areas have seen more attention from owners regarding potential issues. This analysis focuses on documented common problems beyond routine maintenance, providing insights into potential repair costs and solutions for the available engine and transmission configurations.

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mitsubishi Raider, sharing its platform with the Dodge Dakota, presents a mixed reliability picture. The 3.7L V6 engine is prone to intake manifold and oil filter housing leaks, while the 4.7L V8 can experience more significant cylinder head issues. The 42RLE automatic transmission, paired with the V6, may exhibit torque converter shudder or slipping. Suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links can wear over time. Electrical issues, particularly with the instrument cluster and window regulators, are also noted. Exterior and interior components generally fare better, with occasional issues like tailgate latches and HVAC blower motors. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problem areas and factor in possible repair costs.
