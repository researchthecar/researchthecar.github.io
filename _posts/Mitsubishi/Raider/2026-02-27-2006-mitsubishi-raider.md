### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mitsubishi Raider, sharing its platform with the Dodge Dakota, presents a mixed reliability profile. The V6 and V8 engines, particularly the 4.7L V8, can experience significant issues like head gasket failures and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. The 42RLE automatic transmission is also noted for potential shifting problems. Suspension components, such as ball joints and leaf springs, are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, including instrument cluster and power accessory failures, are also reported. Rust can be a concern on the frame and body, especially in harsher climates. While not universally problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
