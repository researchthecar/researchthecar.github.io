**Introduction:**
The 2008 Mitsubishi Raider is a mid-size pickup truck that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmission options. The base engine was a 3.7-liter V6 that produced 202 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, while the optional engine was a 4.7-liter V8 that produced 235 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission.
