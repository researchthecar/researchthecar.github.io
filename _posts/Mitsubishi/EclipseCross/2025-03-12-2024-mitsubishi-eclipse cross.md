The 2024 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is a compact crossover SUV powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. It is exclusively paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and is available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Many owners appreciate the Eclipse Cross for its distinctive styling and comfortable ride. However, some criticize its relatively small cargo area and somewhat lackluster fuel economy.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil level warning light illuminating and potential engine knocking or damage if the oil level is not maintained.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks or underlying engine issues causing the consumption. A compression test can help diagnose the condition of the piston rings. In severe cases, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) - $5,000+ (engine rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like a stumble or lag in power delivery.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change with the correct Mitsubishi-specified fluid may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT may need to be reprogrammed (reflashed) or, in rare cases, replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 (fluid change) to $4,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer may resolve the issue. In some cases, the infotainment unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear wiper motor may fail, resulting in the rear wiper not functioning. This can be a safety issue in inclement weather.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (troubleshooting/software update)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross appears to have relatively few widespread, major issues. The most common complaints revolve around engine oil consumption and CVT behavior, which, while potentially concerning, are not consistently reported across all vehicles. Electrical issues with the infotainment system also occur. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with some potentially requiring expensive repairs or replacements. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used Eclipse Cross before purchase.
