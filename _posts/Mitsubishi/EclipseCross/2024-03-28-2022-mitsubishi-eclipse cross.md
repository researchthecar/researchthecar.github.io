**Introduction:**

The 2022 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is a compact crossover SUV that offers a choice of two engine options: a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-four or a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated inline-four. Transmission options include a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a 6-speed manual transmission (with the 2.5-liter engine only). The Eclipse Cross has a comfortable interior, a spacious cargo area, and advanced safety features. However, it has been criticized for its lackluster performance from the 1.5-liter engine and unrefined suspension.
