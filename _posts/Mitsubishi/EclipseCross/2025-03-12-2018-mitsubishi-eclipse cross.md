The 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is a compact crossover SUV that marked the return of the "Eclipse" name, albeit on a very different type of vehicle than the original sports coupe. It is equipped with a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-four engine producing 152 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Eclipse Cross generally receives positive feedback for its distinctive styling and comfortable ride. However, some criticisms include its somewhat lackluster fuel economy and limited cargo space compared to other vehicles in its class.
