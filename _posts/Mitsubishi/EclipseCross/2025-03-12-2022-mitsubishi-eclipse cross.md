The 2022 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is a compact crossover SUV that aims to blend sporty styling with practicality. It is equipped with a 1.5L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise its distinctive design, comfortable ride, and standard safety features. Some criticisms include its somewhat sluggish acceleration, smaller cargo area compared to competitors, and the CVT's tendency to drone under hard acceleration.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. The amount of oil consumed can vary.
    *   Solution: Closely monitor oil levels, check for leaks, and consider having a leak-down test performed to assess the engine's internal condition. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (diagnosis) - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature failure or issues with the turbocharger, leading to reduced power, unusual noises, or warning lights.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for leaks, damage, or excessive play. Replace the turbocharger if necessary, and check the oil feed lines for blockages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerking, hesitation, or a lack of smooth acceleration, particularly at low speeds or when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Check the CVT fluid level and condition. A CVT fluid change using the correct fluid can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal damage may necessitate transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 (fluid change/service) - $3,000 - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or buzzing noise emanating from the transmission area, especially during acceleration or when the CVT is under load.
    *   Solution: This noise can sometimes be normal for a CVT, but if it becomes excessively loud or is accompanied by other symptoms, it could indicate a problem. Check the CVT fluid level and condition. A fluid change may help. If the noise persists, further inspection by a qualified technician is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 (fluid change/service) - $3,000 - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises, loose handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Inspect suspension bushings for cracks, tears, or excessive play. Replace worn bushings as needed. Consider upgrading to higher-quality aftermarket bushings for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per corner, depending on the bushings replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced glitches, freezing, or unresponsiveness in the infotainment system. This can include issues with the touchscreen, navigation, audio, and connectivity features.
    *   Solution: Try performing a system reset or updating the software to the latest version. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $500 - $1,500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions in sensors such as those for the blind-spot monitoring system, rear cross-traffic alert, or lane departure warning. Symptoms can include false warnings, system deactivation, or error messages.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is malfunctioning. Check for obstructions or damage to the sensor. Replace the faulty sensor. Recalibration may be needed after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, plus recalibration if needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Loose or Rattling Trim Pieces**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing loose or rattling trim pieces within the cabin, which can be distracting and detract from the overall driving experience.
    * Solution: Secure any loose trim pieces by tightening screws or using adhesive. Consider using foam padding or sound-deadening materials to eliminate rattles.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross, while offering distinctive styling and a comfortable ride, has some potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine oil consumption and CVT-related problems are among the more significant concerns. Electrical glitches in the infotainment system can also be frustrating. Suspension bushing wear and interior trim issues are less severe but can still impact the ownership experience. The costs to address these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
