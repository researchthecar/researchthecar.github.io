The 2020 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is a compact crossover SUV known for its distinctive styling and comfortable ride. It's powered by a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. This engine is exclusively paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While owners often appreciate its sporty handling and user-friendly infotainment system, some criticisms include its fuel economy and the design of the rear window, which can impact visibility.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms can include the low oil pressure light illuminating, the engine running rough, or blue smoke emitting from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks promptly. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional engine misfires, leading to rough idling and reduced performance. This can be triggered by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the cause (spark plugs, coils, injectors). Replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the failed part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly from a stop or at lower speeds. This can be due to CVT programming or issues with the transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Software reflash of the CVT control module. In severe cases, fluid change or CVT replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a noticeable whining noise coming from the transmission, especially during acceleration. This can indicate excessive wear or internal damage within the CVT.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician. CVT fluid change may temporarily alleviate the noise. Ultimately, a CVT replacement is often needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature wear of the suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per corner, depending on the bushings affected.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Software update, or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,000+ depending on the fix.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially when the vehicle is not driven for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify parasitic drains. Possible replacement of the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for battery replacement, higher for diagnosing and fixing parasitic drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported the rear wiper motor stops working.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin through the sunroof, typically during heavy rain. This is often caused by clogged drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and clearing the sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the severity and if any trim needs to be removed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While the engine and transmission issues (oil consumption, CVT hesitation/whining) can be concerning and potentially costly to fix, other issues like infotainment glitches, premature bushing wear, and sunroof leaks are relatively less severe. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider a thorough pre-purchase inspection, especially focusing on the CVT's performance and any signs of excessive oil consumption.
