The 2019 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is a compact crossover SUV that offers a distinctive style and a comfortable ride. The sole engine option for this model year is a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 152 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate the Eclipse Cross's unique design and standard features, while others dislike its somewhat lackluster fuel economy and occasionally sluggish acceleration.

**Engine**

**1.5L Turbocharged Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil level light illuminating more frequently and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: There is no definitive fix. Some owners have tried using a different viscosity oil, while others have had to replace the piston rings and/or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ for major engine work
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing hesitation or jerking sensations during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is struggling to find the right gear ratio or "stuttering".
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, a CVT replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software updates; $4,000 - $6,000+ for CVT replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*No Issues Found*

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can freeze, crash, or become unresponsive, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions integrated into the system.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often released to address these issues. A hard reset may be necessary in some cases. If the issue persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) to $500 - $1,500+ for infotainment unit replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not driven for a few days. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Check the charging system for shorts or faulty components. It may be necessary to replace the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement; more for electrical diagnosis and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch/liftgate may not align correctly, causing it to be difficult to close or seal properly. This can lead to wind noise or water leaks.
    *   Solution: Adjust the hatch alignment or replace the weather stripping.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross can present some notable issues to owners. The most concerning issues appear to be related to the engine (excessive oil consumption) and transmission (CVT hesitation). Electrical issues related to the infotainment system and battery drain are also common. The cost of repairs can range from relatively minor fixes like software updates to more significant expenses such as engine and CVT replacements. While not every owner experiences these problems, it's wise to be aware of them when considering a used 2019 Eclipse Cross.
