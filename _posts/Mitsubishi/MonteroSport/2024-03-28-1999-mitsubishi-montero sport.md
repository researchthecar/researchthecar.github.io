**Introduction**

The 1999 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a mid-size SUV powered by a 3.0L V6 engine paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. Key highlights of the vehicle include off-road capabilities, reliability, and interior comfort. However, it falls short in terms of fuel efficiency and modern features.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 Engine**

* **Head gasket failure:** Premature wear of the head gasket causes coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage.
  * Solution: Replacing the head gasket and associated components
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2000+
  * Recalls: None Found
* **Intake manifold gasket leak:** Deterioration of the intake manifold gaskets leads to vacuum leaks, causing rough idle, loss of power, and poor fuel economy.
  * Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gaskets
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh shifting:** Worn or damaged internal components cause difficulty shifting, slipping between gears, and delayed gear engagement.
  * Solution: Overhauling or replacing the transmission
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $3000+
  * Recalls: None Found
* **Transmission fluid leak:** Corrosion or damage to the transmission lines or seals results in a fluid leak, lowering the fluid level and compromising transmission performance.
  * Solution: Replacing or repairing the affected components
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
  * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Synchro damage:** Worn synchronizers create difficulty engaging gears, grinding noises, and gear pop-out.
  * Solution: Replacing the damaged synchronizers
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
  * Recalls: None Found
* **Clutch failure:** Premature wear or damage to the clutch disc or pressure plate causes slipping, difficulty engaging gears, and shuddering.
  * Solution: Replacing the clutch assembly
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1400+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** Worn or damaged front struts cause knocking noises, poor handling, and reduced stability.
  * Solution: Replacing the front struts
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700+
  * Recalls: None Found
* **Ball joint wear:** Loose or worn ball joints lead to rattling noises, excessive play in the steering, and compromised handling.
  * Solution: Replacing the faulty ball joints
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** A failing alternator can result in dimming lights, electrical system problems, and battery discharge.
  * Solution: Replacing the alternator
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700+
  * Recalls: None Found
* **Battery issues:** Premature battery failure causes starting problems and reduced electrical system performance.
  * Solution: Replacing the battery
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

  * Solution: Replacing the affected window regulator
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Climate control issues:** Malfunctioning heater or air conditioning components result in insufficient heating or cooling.
  * Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the affected components
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
  * Recalls: None Found
* **Dashboard rattles:** Loose or vibrating dashboard components create annoying noises.
  * Solution: Identifying and securing the affected components
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
  * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

Overall, the 1999 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a reliable SUV with a robust off-road capability. However, it does exhibit some common issues, particularly with the engine (head gasket failure), transmission (shifting problems), and suspension (strut failure). These issues can be costly to repair, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. While the interior and electrical components are generally reliable, occasional issues with climate control and door locks may arise. Potential owners should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the cost of repairs when considering this vehicle.
