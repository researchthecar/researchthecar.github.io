### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Mitsubishi Montero Sport demonstrates solid reliability, particularly in its powertrain and chassis, aligning with its reputation as a durable off-road capable SUV. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the diesel particulate filter system, which requires proper maintenance and can be susceptible to regeneration issues if driving patterns do not allow for sufficient exhaust temperature. Turbocharger issues, while not extremely common, can occur and are costly to repair. The 8-speed automatic transmission is generally robust, though some owners have reported minor shifting anomalies that may require software updates or fluid services. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and occasional battery drain, are also noted but are not typically indicative of systemic failures. Overall, the Montero Sport is a dependable choice, with most potential issues being manageable with timely attention and appropriate maintenance.
