The 2009 Mitsubishi Montero Sport, also known as the Mitsubishi Pajero Sport in some markets, is a mid-size SUV offering a blend of off-road capability and daily usability. For the 2009 model year, the Montero Sport was primarily equipped with a 3.5L V6 engine producing around 220 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission, depending on the market and trim level. Owners generally appreciate its ruggedness, off-road prowess, and spacious interior. Common dislikes often revolve around its fuel economy, somewhat dated interior styling, and ride quality compared to more modern SUVs.
