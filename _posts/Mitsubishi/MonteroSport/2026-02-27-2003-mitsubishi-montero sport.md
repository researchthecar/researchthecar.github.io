### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a capable SUV with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly its powertrain when properly maintained. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and timing belt replacements on the V6 engines, and torque converter or solenoid problems with the automatic transmission. Suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links can wear over time, and electrical issues like alternator failure are not uncommon. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in rust-belt regions. Addressing these potential problems proactively can ensure the longevity and reliability of the Montero Sport.
