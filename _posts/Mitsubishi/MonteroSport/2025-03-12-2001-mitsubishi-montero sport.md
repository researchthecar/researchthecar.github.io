The 2001 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and rugged design. Engine options for this year include a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing around 132 hp and 148 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine outputting approximately 177 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Montero Sport's reliability, off-road performance, and spacious interior, but some dislike its fuel economy, dated interior, and potential for certain mechanical issues.
