The 2022 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a mid-size SUV known for its ruggedness, off-road capability, and value. The primary engine option for this model year is a 2.4L 4N15 turbo-diesel engine producing around 178 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. This engine is typically paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (Aisin AWR8D6). Owners often appreciate the Montero Sport's spacious interior, comfortable ride (on well-maintained roads), and capable four-wheel-drive system. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated interior design and fuel economy that, while decent for its class, isn't class-leading.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4N15 Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Excessive Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, leading to reduced fuel economy, rough idling during regeneration, and potential engine damage if not completed. Some owners report the regeneration occurring every 100-200 miles.
    *   Solution: Ensure proper engine maintenance, including using high-quality diesel fuel and oil. In some cases, a software update or a forced DPF regeneration performed by a mechanic can alleviate the issue. Replacing the DPF may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update) - $2000+ (DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, poor acceleration, and illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin AWR8D6 8-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation when accelerating or changing gears is also noted.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $800 - $1500 (valve body), $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Leaks/Premature Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear shock absorbers leaking oil prematurely. This can lead to a bouncy or unstable ride, especially when carrying loads or driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (for a pair, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or intermittent functionality of the infotainment system. Bluetooth connectivity issues are also reported.
    *   Solution: Software updates, resetting the system, or replacing the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing the loose panels or components. This may involve adding padding or tightening screws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on complexity, may be DIY)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Mitsubishi Montero Sport generally presents with a mix of minor and moderate issues. Engine and transmission concerns, particularly related to DPF regeneration and harsh shifting, can lead to moderate repair costs. Interior rattles and infotainment system glitches are common but usually less expensive to address. While most issues are not severe safety concerns, neglecting them can lead to more costly repairs down the line. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect the vehicle carefully before purchasing.
