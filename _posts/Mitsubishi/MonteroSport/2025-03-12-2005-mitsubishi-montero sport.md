The 2005 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and relatively affordable price point. For the 2005 model year, the Montero Sport was offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing approximately 135 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing approximately 197 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Montero Sport's ruggedness and spacious interior. Common dislikes include its fuel economy and relatively dated styling.
