The 2012 Mitsubishi Montero Sport, also known as the Pajero Sport in some markets, is a mid-size SUV known for its ruggedness and off-road capabilities. For the 2012 model year, the primary engine option was a 3.0L V6 gasoline engine producing around 220 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque. Depending on the market, a 2.5L diesel engine was also available. Common transmission options included a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Montero Sport's robust build, off-road prowess, and spacious interior.
