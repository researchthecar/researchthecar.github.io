The 2020 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a capable mid-size SUV known for its off-road prowess and spacious interior. It typically comes equipped with a 2.4-liter inline-4 diesel engine producing around 178 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its ruggedness, comfortable ride, and value proposition. However, some criticisms include lackluster fuel economy and a somewhat dated interior design.

**Engine**

**2.4L Diesel Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Engine Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Louder than usual engine noise, especially at idle or low speeds. This can be due to the engine's diesel design and how it operates, but is a common complaint from drivers that have had gasoline engines in the past.
    *   Solution: No fix is normally required since this is a characteristic of the engine design, but ensuring proper engine maintenance (oil changes, filter replacements) can minimize noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic**
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, particularly at lower speeds. This can be more noticeable during initial acceleration or when downshifting.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or transmission fluid flush may improve shift quality. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal damage may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (fluid flush or software update); $1,000 - $3,000+ (valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the rear suspension sagging, especially when carrying heavy loads or towing. This can affect handling and ride quality.
    * Solution: Upgrading to stiffer rear springs or installing air springs can help address this issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the type of upgrade)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the system. Updating the infotainment software can resolve some glitches. If the problem persists, hardware replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset or update); $300 - $1,000+ (hardware replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Tailgate Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power tailgate may fail to open or close properly, or it may make unusual noises.
    * Solution: Check for obstructions, lubricate hinges, and inspect the tailgate struts. If the problem persists, the tailgate motor or control module may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning may blow warm air, or may stop working entirely. This could be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a problem with the blend door actuator.
    * Solution: Have the system inspected for leaks, and recharge the refrigerant. If the compressor or other components are faulty, they will need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the repair
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Mitsubishi Montero Sport presents a mix of potential issues. The transmission's harsh shifting is a common complaint and can range from a minor annoyance to a more significant problem. The infotainment system can be problematic, as well as the air conditioning system. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, but addressing these potential issues proactively can help ensure a positive ownership experience.
