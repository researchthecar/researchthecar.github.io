The 2002 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capability and relatively affordable price point. Engine options for this year included a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing around 132 hp and 148 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 engine, producing approximately 173 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque.
