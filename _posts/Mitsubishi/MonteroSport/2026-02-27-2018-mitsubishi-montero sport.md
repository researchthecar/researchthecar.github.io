### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mitsubishi Montero Sport demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and chassis components, aligning with its reputation as a durable, off-road-capable SUV. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the diesel engine's emissions control system, specifically the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), which can require maintenance or cleaning. Transmission issues, while not widespread, can manifest as leaks or shifting anomalies. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and intermittent battery drains, are also noted. Interior components like climate control and power seats can occasionally fail. Despite these points, the Montero Sport is generally considered a reliable choice for those prioritizing ruggedness and capability, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of systemic design flaws.
