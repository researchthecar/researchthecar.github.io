The 2019 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a mid-size SUV known for its ruggedness and off-road capabilities. The 2019 model came with one engine option, a 2.4L 4N15 turbo-diesel engine producing 178 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission (Aisin AWF8F35). Owners generally appreciate its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency for its class. Common complaints often revolve around its somewhat dated interior design, and occasional concerns about electronic reliability.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4N15 Turbo-Diesel**

* **Excessive Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, leading to decreased fuel economy and potential for the cycle to not complete due to vehicle use type. Some owners experience white smoke and a burning smell during regeneration. This is particularly problematic for owners who primarily drive short distances or in city traffic.
    * Solution: Ensuring the vehicle has adequate opportunities for regeneration by taking it on longer highway drives. In some cases, a forced DPF regeneration performed by a mechanic is required. More extreme cases may require DPF replacement or cleaning. Using a higher-quality, low-ash diesel fuel can help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Forced regeneration: $150 - $300. DPF cleaning: $300 - $500. DPF replacement: $1000 - $2500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Valve Failure/Clogging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased performance, increased emissions, and potential stalling. The engine light may illuminate with codes related to the EGR system.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: EGR valve cleaning: $100-$200. EGR valve replacement: $300 - $600+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Aisin AWF8F35 8-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hesitation or jerky shifts, particularly between lower gears. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold. Some owners have reported difficulty engaging gears.
    * Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush with the correct specification fluid, and in some cases, a software update. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission fluid flush: $200 - $400. Valve body replacement: $800 - $2000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at low speeds or when the torque converter is locking up. Can also present as erratic shifting or failure to shift.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be recommended if internal damage is present.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Torque converter replacement: $1000 - $3000+. Transmission rebuild/replacement: $3000 - $7000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor ride quality, and instability, especially when carrying loads or towing. Leaking oil from the shock absorber is also a common symptom.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear shock absorbers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per pair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes randomly. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Performing a software update (if available). In some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $0 - $150. Infotainment unit replacement: $500 - $1500+.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle battery drains quickly, especially if left unused for a few days. This can be caused by parasitic drain from electrical components.
    * Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve testing and replacing faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard surface, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacement of the dashboard.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2019 Mitsubishi Montero Sport has some notable issues, primarily revolving around the diesel engine's DPF system and the 8-speed automatic transmission. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and battery drain can also be problematic. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to address (e.g., EGR cleaning, shock absorber replacement), others like DPF replacement or transmission repairs can be costly. The severity of these issues varies depending on driving habits and maintenance. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider having a thorough inspection performed before purchasing.
