The most significant concerns revolve around the engine (timing belt and oil leaks), transmission (rough shifting), and suspension (worn components). While the timing belt issue can lead to significant engine damage if not addressed, other issues are generally less severe and can be managed with regular maintenance and timely repairs. Repair costs vary depending on the specific problem, but addressing these issues early can help prevent more costly repairs down the road.
