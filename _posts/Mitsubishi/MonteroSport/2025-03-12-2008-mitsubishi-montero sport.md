The 2008 Mitsubishi Montero Sport, also known as the Pajero Sport in some markets, is a mid-size SUV known for its ruggedness and off-road capabilities. In the US market, it was primarily offered with a 3.5L V6 engine producing around 222 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically included a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its off-road prowess and spacious interior, but common complaints revolve around fuel economy, dated interior design, and potential maintenance costs associated with its age.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Valve Stem Seal Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blue smoke on startup, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for an extended period. This indicates oil leaking past the valve stem seals into the combustion chamber.
    *   Solution: Replace valve stem seals. Requires removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noise from the engine, rough running, or complete engine failure. The 3.5L V6 is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, the valves can collide with the pistons, causing severe damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, tensioner, and water pump at the recommended interval (typically every 60,000 - 90,000 miles).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, shifts harshly, or fails to shift at all. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, a failing valve body, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service, including replacing the fluid and filter. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the transmission may require a complete rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (service) - $3,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and steering response. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per corner
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sagging Rear Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than the front, especially when carrying a load. Reduced ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace worn rear springs or shocks. Adding aftermarket air bags inside the springs can assist with load levelling
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working or operate intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Corrosion of Wiring Harness Connectors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, sensors malfunctioning, or the engine not starting. Often worse in areas with high humidity or road salt.
    *   Solution: Clean and protect corroded connectors. In severe cases, the wiring harness may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on severity
