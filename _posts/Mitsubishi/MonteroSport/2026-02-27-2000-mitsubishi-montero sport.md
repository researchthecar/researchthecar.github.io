### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a capable SUV with a generally solid mechanical foundation. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the V6 engines, where intake manifold gaskets and timing belts require attention. Automatic transmission torque converters and solenoids can also be points of concern. On the suspension, ball joint wear and rear leaf spring issues are noted. Electrical components like the alternator and window regulators are not immune to failure. Exterior rust, especially on the frame, is a significant concern for vehicles in certain climates. Interior wear on seats and HVAC blower motor issues are also common. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Montero Sports have proven durable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
