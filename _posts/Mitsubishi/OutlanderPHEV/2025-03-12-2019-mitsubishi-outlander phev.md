The 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is a plug-in hybrid SUV that combines a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine (117 hp, 137 lb-ft of torque) with two electric motors and a 12 kWh battery pack. It offers all-wheel drive and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate its fuel efficiency, available federal tax credit, and electric-only driving range. Common complaints include a small cargo area, sometimes sluggish acceleration, and a relatively outdated interior compared to newer competitors.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Electric Motors**
*   **Reduced EV Range Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report a gradual decrease in the available all-electric driving range as the battery ages, particularly in colder climates. This can be significantly less than the EPA-estimated range of 22 miles.
    *   Solution: Battery capacity degradation is normal over time. There is no guaranteed solution to restore the original range. Replacing the battery pack is an option, but is very costly. Consider recalibrating the Battery Management System (BMS) with dealer tools, but this may not fix the issue if the cells are degrading.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement can range from $8,000 - $15,000+ depending on the source and labor. Recalibrating BMS is typically $100-$200 at the dealership.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EV System Service Required Message**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A warning message indicating a problem with the hybrid or electric system. Can be accompanied by reduced power or inability to enter EV mode. Can be related to multiple issues in the EV system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose with a capable scan tool to determine the root cause of the error. This can range from a simple sensor issue to a more complex inverter or motor problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the cause, ranging from $100 for a sensor to several thousand for a motor or inverter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**2.0L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine stalling or hesitating, especially during transitions between electric and gasoline power, or during acceleration.
    *   Solution: This can be caused by several factors, including faulty sensors (such as the mass airflow sensor or oxygen sensors), a dirty throttle body, or a software issue with the engine control unit (ECU). Diagnosing the root cause with a scan tool is recommended. If it is a software issue, a reflash of the ECU by the dealer can often resolve it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ depending on the faulty component. ECU reflashing is typically $100-$200 at the dealership.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a jerking or shuddering sensation from the CVT, especially at lower speeds. This can be more pronounced during cold weather.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change using the correct Mitsubishi-specified fluid is the first step. In some cases, a CVT software update may also be necessary. If the problem persists, internal CVT damage may be present, requiring repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change: $150 - $300. CVT software update: $50-$200. CVT repair/replacement: $3,000 - $6,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset by holding the power button down for an extended period. A software update from the dealer may also address the issue. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $50-$200. Infotainment unit replacement: $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty charging the vehicle, error messages related to charging, or the charging port failing to latch correctly.
    *   Solution: Inspect the charging port for damage or debris. Try using a different charging cable and/or charging station to rule out external issues. If the problem persists, the charging port or on-board charger may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Charging port replacement: $300-$700. On-board charger replacement: $800 - $2000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The tailgate struts weaken, causing the tailgate to not stay open or to close unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replace the tailgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported various rattling and squeaking noises coming from the dashboard, door panels, and rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the noise and apply felt tape or other sound-deadening material to the affected areas. This often requires trial and error.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the source and complexity. $50 - $300+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV has a few common issues, primarily centered around the electric system (battery degradation, charging), the CVT transmission (jerking/shuddering), and electrical components (infotainment system). Engine issues, while reported, are less frequent. The severity and cost of repairs vary greatly, with potential for expensive battery or CVT replacements. Addressing these issues early can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and performance.
