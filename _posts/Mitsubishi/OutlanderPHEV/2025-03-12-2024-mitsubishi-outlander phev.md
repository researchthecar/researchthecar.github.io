* **Excessive Battery Drain / Reduced Electric Range**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a significantly lower electric range than the advertised 38 miles, particularly in cold weather or when using climate control. Battery drains quickly, reverting to gasoline engine operation sooner than expected.
    * Solution: Software updates from Mitsubishi may improve battery management and range estimation. Thoroughly inspect the battery's health and capacity at a Mitsubishi service center.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis may be free or cost a nominal fee. Repairs could range from $0 (if software fix) to thousands if battery replacement is needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Battery Not Charging**

    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle fails to charge when plugged into a charging station or wall outlet. Error messages related to the charging system may appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Check the charging equipment and connections. A software update to the Battery Management System (BMS) or replacement of a faulty charging module might be required. In some instances, the onboard charger has been known to cause issues.
