The 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is a plug-in hybrid SUV that combines a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with two electric motors and a 20 kWh battery pack. This setup delivers a combined output of 248 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. Unlike the standard Outlander, the PHEV version only offers this single powertrain option with a single-speed transmission. Owners often praise the Outlander PHEV for its fuel efficiency, electric driving range, and spacious interior. However, some common complaints include the infotainment system's responsiveness and the vehicle's somewhat lackluster acceleration in hybrid mode.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor**

*   **Reduced EV Range / Battery Capacity**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a noticeable decrease in the vehicle's all-electric range over time, even with consistent charging habits. This may be due to the battery degrading due to age or potentially due to extreme temperature conditions. Some owners report the estimated mileage is inaccurate and lower than advertised.
    *   Solution: A battery health check can be performed by the dealer. In some cases, a software update might recalibrate the battery management system. If the battery is determined to be degraded beyond a certain threshold, replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement can be $8,000 - $15,000+ depending on extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Single-Speed Transmission**

**Single-Speed Transmission**

*   **Whining Noise During Acceleration/Deceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a whining noise emanating from the drivetrain during acceleration or deceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This could be a sign of an issue with the single-speed transmission's gear mesh or bearings.
    *   Solution: A thorough inspection of the transmission is needed. Depending on the severity, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission rebuild is around $3000-$6000. Transmission replacement is around $6000 - $8000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. Check for software updates from Mitsubishi and install them. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ for infotainment unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Charging Issues (Home Charger/Public Charger)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle fails to charge consistently, either at home or at public charging stations. The charging indicator may not light up, or the charging process may stop prematurely. This can be related to the onboard charger, the charging port, or the charging cable.
    *   Solution: Test with multiple charging stations/cables. Inspect the charging port for damage or debris. A diagnostic check can pinpoint the faulty component (onboard charger, charging port, wiring).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Onboard charger replacement: $1000-$2000+. Charging port replacement: $300-$700+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin through the sunroof, especially during heavy rain. This can damage the headliner and other interior components.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sunroof seals and drains for obstructions or damage. Clean the drains and reseal the sunroof if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on severity and if any electronics were damaged
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic tailgate fails to open or close properly, or gets stuck. This can be caused by a faulty motor, damaged sensors, or alignment issues.
    *   Solution: Check the tailgate struts and hinges for damage. Inspect the sensors and wiring for loose connections. Recalibrate the tailgate system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1000+, depending on the needed parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises from Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattling or squeaking noises emanate from the dashboard, particularly on rough roads. This can be caused by loose trim pieces, wiring harnesses, or components rubbing against each other.
    *   Solution: Locate and secure the source of the noise. Apply felt tape or foam padding to prevent further rubbing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV generally exhibits issues ranging from minor inconveniences to more significant mechanical problems. Infotainment glitches and interior noises are common but relatively inexpensive to address. However, potential issues with the electrical components like the charging system and sunroof leaks can be costly to fix. Battery degradation is a long-term concern for any EV/PHEV, and a major expense if replacement is needed. While the Outlander PHEV offers appealing fuel efficiency and electric range, buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their ownership costs.
