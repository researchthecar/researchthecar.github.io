The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is a plug-in hybrid SUV offering a blend of electric efficiency and gasoline-powered range. It features a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine paired with two electric motors, producing a combined 221 horsepower and 137 lb-ft of torque. A single-speed direct-drive transmission is used. Owners appreciate the Outlander PHEV for its electric driving range, fuel economy, and available all-wheel drive. Common complaints revolve around the infotainment system, seat comfort, and overall performance compared to non-hybrid SUVs.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Electric Motor System**

*   **Reduced Electric Range Over Time**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gradual decrease in battery capacity and available electric driving range over several years. Drivers may notice they can no longer achieve the originally advertised electric range on a full charge. This is due to normal battery degradation.
    *   Solution: Battery rebalancing can sometimes improve range slightly. The most definitive solution is battery pack replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery pack replacement can range from $8,000 - $15,000+ depending on the location.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **High Voltage Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the high-voltage battery system can result in the vehicle being unable to drive in electric mode or start at all. Warning lights related to the hybrid system will illuminate.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is necessary to determine the cause of the failure. If the battery pack is faulty, replacement is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Replacement of the high-voltage battery pack can range from $8,000 - $15,000+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Brakes**

*   **Brake Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The regenerative braking system assists in slowing the vehicle, which can reduce the wear and tear on the mechanical brake pads, but it does not eliminate it. Owners have reported needing to replace brake pads sooner than expected.
    *   Solution: Brake pad and rotor replacement as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per axle depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash requiring a reset. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate controls.
    *   Solution: Software updates from the dealership can sometimes resolve these issues. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty charging the vehicle using either a Level 1 (120V) or Level 2 (240V) charger. This can manifest as the vehicle not recognizing the charger, slow charging speeds, or the charger cutting out mid-charge.
    *   Solution: Verify the charging cable and outlet are functioning correctly. The charging port or on-board charger may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Fan Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC fan motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents for heating or cooling. This can be intermittent or permanent.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HVAC fan motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV presents a mix of electric vehicle and traditional SUV ownership concerns. The most significant issues relate to potential battery degradation and high-voltage battery failure, which can be costly to rectify. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and charging process are also relatively common. While brake wear can occur, the regenerative braking system often extends the life of the mechanical brakes. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of the possible high-cost repairs associated with the hybrid system and carefully evaluate the vehicle's service history.
