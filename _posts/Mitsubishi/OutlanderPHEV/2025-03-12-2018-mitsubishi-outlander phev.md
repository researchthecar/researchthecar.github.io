The 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) is an SUV that combines a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine (117 hp and 137 lb-ft of torque) with two electric motors and a 12 kWh battery pack, providing all-wheel drive. Owners often appreciate its fuel efficiency and electric-only driving range. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated interior and modest power output compared to some competitors.

**Electric Motor**

**Front Electric Motor**
* **Motor Overheating**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the front electric motor overheating during extended periods of electric-only driving, particularly in hot weather or when climbing hills. This can result in reduced power or a temporary shutdown of the electric motor. Error codes related to motor temperature sensors may appear.
    * Solution: The issue can sometimes be resolved by replacing the front electric motor temperature sensor. In more severe cases, the front electric motor might need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and if the motor needs to be replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Battery Pack**
* **Reduced Battery Capacity Over Time**
    * Description/Symptoms: Like all EV batteries, the 12 kWh battery in the 2018 Outlander PHEV experiences degradation over time. This results in a gradual reduction of the vehicle's all-electric range. The amount of degradation depends on usage patterns, climate, and charging habits.
    * Solution: Battery capacity degradation is a normal part of EV ownership. There is no easy fix beyond replacing the battery pack which is very expensive. Some driving habits can help slow degradation, such as avoiding frequent DC fast charging and keeping the battery charge level between 20% and 80% most of the time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix:
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the Battery Management System (BMS), which can lead to inaccurate state-of-charge readings, premature charging termination, or error messages related to the battery.
    * Solution: A software update to the BMS can sometimes resolve these issues. In other cases, a faulty BMS module may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,500+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the rear suspension of the 2018 Outlander PHEV tends to sag over time, particularly when the vehicle is frequently loaded with cargo or passengers. This can lead to a decrease in ride height and potentially affect handling.
    * Solution: Replacing the rear springs can restore the ride height and improve the vehicle's handling. Heavier-duty springs may be a suitable option for vehicles that frequently carry heavy loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Display Screen Freezing/Malfunctioning**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment display screen can occasionally freeze, glitch, or become unresponsive. This can affect access to navigation, audio controls, and climate settings.
    * Solution: A software update can sometimes resolve the issue. In other cases, the display unit may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Charging Port Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have encountered problems with the charging port, including difficulty inserting or removing the charging cable, or the vehicle failing to recognize the connection.
    * Solution: The charging port may need to be inspected for damage or debris. In some cases, the charging port assembly may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $700
    * Recalls: None Found

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor may fail, resulting in a lack of airflow from the vents. This can affect both heating and air conditioning.
    * Solution: The blower motor typically needs to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The tailgate struts can weaken or fail over time, causing the tailgate to be difficult to open or close, or to not stay open on its own.
    * Solution: Replacing the tailgate struts is a straightforward repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Heater Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may stop working on one or more seats.
    * Solution: The heating element or associated wiring may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (depending on severity of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV has some common issues. While some electric motor and battery problems can be costly to repair, other issues, like suspension sagging and infotainment glitches, are less severe but still require attention. Overall, the vehicle's reliability is decent, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues.
