The 2021 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is a plug-in hybrid SUV that combines a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with two electric motors and a 13.8 kWh battery pack, producing a combined 221 horsepower and ample torque for everyday driving. It's only available with a single-speed direct drive transmission. Owners often praise its fuel efficiency in hybrid mode and its ability to drive short distances on electric power alone. Some common dislikes include its relatively small cargo space compared to non-hybrid SUVs and its somewhat dated infotainment system.
