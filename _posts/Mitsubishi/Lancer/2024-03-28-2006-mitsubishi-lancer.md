**2006 Mitsubishi Lancer**

The 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan that was offered with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-four and a 2.4-liter inline-four. The 2.0-liter engine produced 120 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, while the 2.4-liter engine produced 160 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a standard five-speed manual transmission, while a four-speed automatic transmission was optional.

The Lancer was praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and sporty handling. However, it was also criticized for its cramped interior, lack of features, and underpowered engines.
