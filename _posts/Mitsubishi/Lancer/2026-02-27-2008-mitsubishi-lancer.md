### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer is a generally dependable vehicle, especially the models equipped with the 2.0L or 2.4L naturally aspirated engines and manual transmissions. The CVT, while offering fuel efficiency, has seen some reports of hesitation or jerking, which can be costly to repair if it progresses. Engine oil leaks are a possibility, particularly on higher-mileage examples. Electrical issues like window regulators and battery drain are not uncommon but are typically manageable. Suspension components like bushings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Overall, the Lancer offers good value with a few predictable areas that may require attention as the vehicle ages.
