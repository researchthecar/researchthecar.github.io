### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mitsubishi Lancer is a generally reliable compact car, especially in its naturally aspirated engine variants. The main areas to be mindful of are the CVT transmission, which can experience slipping or hesitation issues, and the turbocharged engines found in performance models, which may be more prone to turbocharger or head gasket problems. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and power window failures, are also reported but are typically not prohibitively expensive to fix. For buyers considering a Lancer, opting for a model with a manual transmission and a naturally aspirated engine will likely yield the most trouble-free ownership experience. Regular maintenance and addressing any early signs of trouble are crucial for maximizing its lifespan.
