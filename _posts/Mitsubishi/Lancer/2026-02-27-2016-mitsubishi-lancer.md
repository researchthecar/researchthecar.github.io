### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mitsubishi Lancer is generally considered a dependable vehicle, especially with its naturally aspirated engines. The 2.0L and 2.4L engines are robust and typically do not present major reliability concerns. The 5-speed manual transmission is also a solid performer. The CVT, while common, has a higher potential for issues, particularly related to fluid degradation and overheating, which can lead to costly repairs. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear over time, leading to common symptoms. Electrical issues, such as window regulators and infotainment glitches, are also noted but are not typically indicative of systemic failures. Overall, the Lancer offers good value for its reliability, with the CVT being the primary area to monitor closely.
