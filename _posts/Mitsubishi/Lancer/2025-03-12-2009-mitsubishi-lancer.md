The 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact car known for its sporty styling and affordability. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-4 producing 152 hp and 146 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 168 hp and 167 lb-ft of torque, found in the GTS trim level. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Some owners appreciate the Lancer's handling and fuel economy, while common complaints include its somewhat dated interior and road noise.

**Engine**

    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil every few thousand miles and, in severe cases, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels closely and consider using a higher viscosity oil. If consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test can help determine the cause. Piston ring replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
