### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer generally offers good reliability, particularly with its standard 1.8L and 2.0L engines and manual transmissions. The primary area of concern for this model year is the 6-speed CVT, which has been known to develop issues related to fluid degradation or leaks, potentially leading to costly repairs. For performance-oriented Evolution models, the turbocharged engine and its associated components, like the turbocharger and head gasket, can be more prone to issues under demanding use. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are typically robust and do not present widespread reliability concerns beyond normal wear and tear. Owners should prioritize regular maintenance, especially for the CVT fluid, to maximize the lifespan of their vehicle.
