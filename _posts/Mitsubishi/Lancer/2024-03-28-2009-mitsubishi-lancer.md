**Introduction:**

The 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan that offers a balance of performance and value. It is available with three engine options: a 2.0L inline-four with 152 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4L inline-four with 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-four with 237 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque. All engine options come standard with a five-speed manual transmission, with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) available as an option on the 2.0L and 2.4L engines.
