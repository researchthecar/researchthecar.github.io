The 2015 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan known for its sporty styling and affordability. Engine options include a 2.0L inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L inline-4 producing 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. The 2.0L engine is typically paired with a 5-speed manual or a CVT, while the 2.4L engine is usually paired with a CVT, though earlier models offered a 5-speed manual. Owners often appreciate the Lancer's sharp handling and aggressive looks but may find the interior materials and fuel economy less appealing.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Regularly check oil levels and top off as needed. If consumption is excessive, a leak-down test can help identify the source (e.g., piston rings or valve seals). Repair options range from replacing valve stem seals to a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported stalling, especially at low speeds or when idling. The issue may be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Check and clean the mass airflow sensor (MAF) and throttle body. Inspect for vacuum leaks. In some cases, a software update from Mitsubishi might address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Shuddering or Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced shuddering, jerking, or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be due to wear and tear on the CVT belt or issues with the valve body.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change with the correct Mitsubishi fluid (CVT-J4) is often the first step. If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or a complete CVT rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or a parasitic drain on the battery, leading to a dead battery after a short period of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Have a mechanic perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, a faulty alternator, or a malfunctioning module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Fog Light Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the front fog lights crack easily, especially in colder climates.
    *   Solution: Replace the fog light assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In warmer climates, some owners have reported cracking or warping of the dashboard, particularly around the instrument cluster or airbag cover.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement is the typical solution but can be costly. Some owners opt for dashboard covers as a more affordable alternative.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Mitsubishi Lancer can be a reliable and stylish compact car, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L engine and potential CVT issues in models equipped with that transmission. Electrical problems like battery drain can also occur. While these issues can be costly to repair, addressing them proactively can help maintain the Lancer's reliability and enjoyment.
