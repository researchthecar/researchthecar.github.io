**Introduction**

The 2010 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan with responsive handling and a comfortable interior. It comes standard with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual transmission. A 2.4-liter four-cylinder and a CVT are optional. With 148 horsepower and 145 ft-lb of torque, the 1.8-liter engine is adequate for most driving situations. The 2.4-liter engine produces 168 horsepower and 167 ft-lb of torque, providing more power for highway driving and passing. The CVT provides smooth acceleration and good fuel economy.

Owners appreciate the Lancer's sporty styling, spacious interior, and affordable price. However, some have reported issues with its reliability and fuel economy.
