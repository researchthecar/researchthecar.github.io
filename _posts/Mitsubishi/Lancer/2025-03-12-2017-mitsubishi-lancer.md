The 2017 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan known for its sporty styling and affordable price point. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter inline-4 generating 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), though the 2.4L engine was almost exclusively offered with the CVT. Owners appreciate the Lancer's handling and available all-wheel drive (AWD) system, but often criticize its outdated interior, fuel economy, and lack of modern features compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 2.0L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and more frequent oil changes may mitigate the issue. A mechanic may perform an oil consumption test to determine the severity and whether piston ring replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report shuddering, hesitation during acceleration, slipping, and overall poor performance of the CVT. In some cases, the transmission may fail completely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT fluid can sometimes resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, a complete transmission replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 for fluid change, $3,000 - $5,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension components, particularly struts, shocks, and control arm bushings, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts, shocks, or control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the specific components needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Bluetooth Connectivity**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent Bluetooth connection issues, including difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, and poor audio quality during phone calls.
    *   Solution: Attempting to update the infotainment system software or replacing the Bluetooth module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software update, $300 - $600+ for Bluetooth module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Backup Camera**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the backup camera not working or the screen being black
    *   Solution: Replacement of the backup camera module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced cooling performance or complete failure of the air conditioning system. This may be due to a refrigerant leak, faulty compressor, or other component failure.
    *   Solution: Leak test and recharge, compressor replacement, or replacement of other faulty components (condenser, evaporator, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for leak test and recharge, $500 - $1,200+ for compressor replacement and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Mitsubishi Lancer presents a mix of potential issues, with the CVT transmission being a significant concern due to its potential for failure. Engine oil consumption on the 2.0L variant and premature suspension wear are also notable. Electrical issues like Bluetooth connectivity problems and A/C failure can be frustrating for owners. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to costly repairs, with transmission replacements being the most expensive. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase, paying particular attention to the transmission's performance and maintenance history.
