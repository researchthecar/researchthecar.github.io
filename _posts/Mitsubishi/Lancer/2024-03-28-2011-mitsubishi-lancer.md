**Introduction**

The 2011 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan offered with a choice of two engines and three transmission options. The base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. A 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that generates 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque is also available. Both engines can be paired with a five-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Available in ES, SE, and GTS trims, the Lancer is praised for its responsive handling, spacious interior, and affordability. However, it is criticized for its lack of power, unrefined interior, and dated technology.
