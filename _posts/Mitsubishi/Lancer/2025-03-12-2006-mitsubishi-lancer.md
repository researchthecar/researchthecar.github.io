The 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer has some common issues ranging in severity and cost. Engine and transmission issues such as rough idling, shifting problems, and catalytic converter failure can be moderately expensive to repair. Suspension issues like worn struts and broken sway bar links affect handling and ride comfort. Electrical problems such as failing power windows and a faulty turn signal switch can be inconvenient. Rust, particularly on the rear wheel wells and rocker panels, is a common concern and can require significant repair work. Cracked dashboards detract from the interior appearance. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and budget for potential repairs.
