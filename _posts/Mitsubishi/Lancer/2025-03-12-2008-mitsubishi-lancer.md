**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**
*   **Check Engine Light and Misfires due to Failed Ignition Coils**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and the engine may experience misfires, rough idling, and reduced power. This can be caused by failing ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil, depending on whether you DIY or go to a mechanic.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oxygen Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, decreased fuel economy, poor engine performance, and/or a failed emissions test.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ per sensor, depending on sensor location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Check Engine Light and Misfires due to Failed Ignition Coils**

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
*   **CVT Transmission Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, hesitation during acceleration, erratic shifting, or complete transmission failure. These transmissions are known to have issues.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or fluid change might help. More severe cases require transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components (Struts, Shocks, Bushings)**

    *   Solution: Replace worn struts, shocks, and/or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the component and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows not working, working intermittently, or making unusual noises. This is often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.

**Summary**

The 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer has a mix of potential issues. The CVT transmission is a significant concern due to its potential for failure, which can be costly to repair. Electrical and suspension problems are also relatively common and can contribute to overall maintenance costs. Rust can be a problem in certain environments. While some issues are relatively minor, others like transmission failure can be quite severe and expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchasing.
