The 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan known for its sporty handling and affordable price point. The base engine option is a 2.0L inline-4 producing 120 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque (non-turbo version), or a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 162 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Lancer's fuel efficiency and responsive steering, but common complaints include a somewhat basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and reported reliability concerns, particularly with certain electrical components and some drivetrain issues.
