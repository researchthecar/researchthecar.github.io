The 2011 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact car known for its sporty styling and affordability. Engine options include a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine producing 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque (Ralliart). Transmission options are a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often praise the Lancer's handling and fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.0L), but common complaints include a somewhat unrefined interior and potential reliability concerns, particularly with the CVT.

**Engine**

**2.0L Four-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil level warning light or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Regularly monitor oil levels and use the recommended oil type and viscosity. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic may recommend a compression test to check for worn piston rings or valve seals. In severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change/top off) - $3000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Four-Cylinder Engine (Ralliart)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail due to oil starvation or bearing wear. Symptoms include reduced power, whining or screeching noises from the engine bay, and potentially oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and avoiding aggressive driving when the engine is cold can help prevent turbocharger failure. If the turbocharger fails, it needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is prone to failure. Symptoms include shuddering, slipping, hesitation, difficulty accelerating, and unusual noises. In some cases, the transmission may fail completely, leaving the vehicle immobile.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CVT fluid at recommended intervals (usually every 30,000 miles) can help prolong its life. However, once symptoms appear, a full transmission replacement is often the only viable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 (CVT fluid change) - $3000 - $5000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances. This is especially noticeable over bumps or during cornering.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks. It's recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working, often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Diagnose whether the motor or regulator is the cause of the issue. Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may fail to lock or unlock all doors, or it may operate erratically. This can be caused by a faulty door lock actuator or a problem with the central locking module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the malfunction. Replace the faulty door lock actuator or repair the central locking module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per door actuator, $200 - $500 for module repair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially Wheel Arches and Undercarriage)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop, especially in areas exposed to road salt and moisture. This is often found on the wheel arches, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Address rust as soon as it is detected to prevent further damage. This may involve sanding, rust removal, and repainting. In severe cases, panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard may crack, especially in vehicles exposed to high heat and sunlight.
    * Solution: Replace the entire dashboard.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The A/C system may stop blowing cold air, often due to a refrigerant leak or a faulty compressor.
    *   Solution: Recharge the refrigerant or replace the faulty component, such as the compressor, condenser, or evaporator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (recharge), $400 - $1200 (component replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mitsubishi Lancer has a mix of potential issues, with the CVT transmission being a significant concern due to its high failure rate and costly replacement. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failure (Ralliart), can also be expensive to address. Suspension wear and electrical problems are relatively common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. Rust can be a concern in certain climates and should be inspected before purchase. While the Lancer offers sporty styling and decent handling, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
