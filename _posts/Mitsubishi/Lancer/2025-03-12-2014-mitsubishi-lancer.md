The 2014 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan known for its sporty styling and available all-wheel-drive system. Engine options for this year include a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter inline-4 generating 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions include a 5-speed manual (available with the 2.0L engine) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that can be had with both engines. Owners often appreciate the Lancer's affordability, handling, and distinctive appearance, while common dislikes include the dated interior, limited fuel economy, and lack of some modern features found in competing vehicles.
