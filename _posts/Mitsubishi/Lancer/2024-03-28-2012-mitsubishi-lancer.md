**Introduction:**
The 2012 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan that offers a comfortable ride and a variety of engine and transmission options. It features a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque paired with a five-speed manual transmission or an optional continuously variable transmission (CVT). A 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque is also available, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. Overall, the Lancer is a reliable vehicle, but it has some common issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.0L Four-Cylinder Engine**
- **Intake manifold cracking:** This can cause a loss of engine power and an increase in fuel consumption. The solution is to replace the intake manifold, which can cost $500 - $1000+.
- **Timing chain tensioner failure:** This can cause the timing chain to skip or break, leading to catastrophic engine damage. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner and timing chain, which can cost $1500 - $2000+.

**2.4L Four-Cylinder Engine**
- **Oil leaks:** This can be caused by a number of issues, including a leaking oil pan gasket or a cracked oil filter housing. The solution is to replace the leaking component, which can cost $100 - $500+.
- **Water pump failure:** This can cause the engine to overheat. The solution is to replace the water pump, which can cost $200 - $400+.

**Transmission**

**Five-Speed Manual Transmission**
- **Shifter linkage failure:** This can make it difficult or impossible to shift gears. The solution is to replace the shifter linkage, which can cost $200 - $400+.

**Five-Speed Automatic Transmission**
- **Slipping gears:** This can cause the transmission to hesitate or jerk when shifting gears. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission, which can cost $1500 - $3000+.
- **Torque converter failure:** This can cause the transmission to lose power. The solution is to replace the torque converter, which can cost $1000 - $2000+.

**CVT Transmission**
- **Belt slipping:** This can cause the transmission to hesitate or jerk when shifting gears. The solution is to replace the CVT belt, which can cost $1000 - $1500+.
- **Control module failure:** This can cause the transmission to shift erratically or not at all. The solution is to replace the control module, which can cost $500 - $1000+.

**Suspension**

- **Strut mount bearing failure:** This can cause a clunking noise when driving over bumps. The solution is to replace the strut mount bearings, which can cost $200 - $400+.
- **Control arm bushing failure:** This can cause a rattling noise when driving over bumps. The solution is to replace the control arm bushings, which can cost $100 - $200+.

**Electrical**

- **Headlight switch failure:** This can cause the headlights to turn off or flicker. The solution is to replace the headlight switch, which can cost $100 - $200+.
- **Battery drain:** This can cause the battery to die prematurely. The solution is to find the source of the parasitic drain and repair it, which can cost $100 - $500+.

**Exterior**

- **Door lock actuator failure:** This can make it difficult or impossible to open the doors. The solution is to replace the door lock actuator, which can cost $100 - $200+.
- **Tail light cover cracking:** This can allow water to leak into the tail light assembly. The solution is to replace the tail light cover, which can cost $50 - $100+.

**Interior**

- **Window switch failure:** This can make it difficult or impossible to open or close the windows. The solution is to replace the window switch, which can cost $100 - $200+.
- **Center console creaking:** This can be a annoying noise when driving over bumps. The solution is to insulate the center console, which can cost $50 - $100+.

**Summary:**
The 2012 Mitsubishi Lancer is a reliable vehicle, but it does have some common issues that owners should be aware of. The most severe issues are the timing chain tensioner failure and the CVT transmission control module failure, which can both lead to catastrophic engine or transmission damage. The cost to repair these issues can be significant. However, other issues, such as the strut mount bearing failure and the window switch failure, are less severe and less expensive to repair. Overall, the Lancer is a good value for the money, but it is important to be aware of the potential issues that it may have.
