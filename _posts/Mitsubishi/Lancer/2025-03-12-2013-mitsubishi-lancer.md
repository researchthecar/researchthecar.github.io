The 2013 Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact sedan known for its sporty handling and affordable price point. Engine options include a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4-liter inline-4 generating 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), depending on the trim level. Owners often appreciate the Lancer's responsive steering and available all-wheel-drive system. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated interior, lack of modern features compared to competitors, and reports of certain reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing high oil consumption, often requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust in severe cases, or a noticeable drop in the oil level on the dipstick.
    * Solution: The most common solutions involve replacing the piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires/Check Engine Light**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners may experience engine misfires, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating. This can be caused by a faulty ignition coil.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.0L engine, the 2.4L engine can also suffer from excessive oil consumption.
    * Solution: Similar to the 2.0L engine, the solution involves replacing the piston rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Failure/Shuddering**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported CVT failure or experiencing shuddering, hesitation, or jerking during acceleration. This is most often seen at higher mileage.
    * Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the CVT.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sudden loss of power, dead battery, difficulty starting the car, or warning lights illuminating on the dashboard (battery light, check engine light).
    * Solution: Replacing the failed alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Fuel Pump Relay**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the car, engine stalling, or complete fuel pump failure.
    * Solution: Replacing the fuel pump relay.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature rusting, especially in areas prone to road salt exposure (wheel wells, rocker panels, undercarriage).
    * Solution: Rust repair, body panel replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning blowing warm air or not working at all. Common causes are compressor failure, refrigerant leaks, or issues with the A/C condenser.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Mitsubishi Lancer can be a decent used car option, however, there are some reliability issues to be aware of. The most significant problems revolve around excessive oil consumption in both engine options and potential CVT transmission failures. Electrical issues like alternator and fuel pump relay failures are also common. The severity and cost of these repairs vary, with engine and transmission work being the most expensive. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, pay close attention to any signs of these common issues, and factor potential repair costs into their purchase decision.
