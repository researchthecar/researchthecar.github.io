### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mitsubishi Lancer offers a generally reliable ownership experience, especially for models equipped with the naturally aspirated engines and manual transmissions. The CVT and the performance-oriented TC-SST transmissions, while offering different driving characteristics, have shown a higher propensity for issues, particularly related to wear and complex internal components. Turbocharged engines in performance variants, while potent, introduce potential for more significant and costly repairs like turbocharger and head gasket failures. Electrical gremlins are not uncommon, with power window motors and alternators being typical wear items. The suspension is generally robust, though performance variants may see quicker wear on bushings. Overall, the Lancer is a solid choice if well-maintained, with a caveat for its more complex transmission and turbocharged engine options.
