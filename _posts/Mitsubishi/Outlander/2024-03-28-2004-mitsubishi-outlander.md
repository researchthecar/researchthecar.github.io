**Introduction to the 2004 Mitsubishi Outlander**

The 2004 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV that was available with either a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine or a 3.0-liter V6 engine. The four-cylinder engine produced 142 horsepower and 158 lb-ft of torque, while the V6 engine produced 202 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission. The Outlander came standard with front-wheel drive, but all-wheel drive was available as an option.

The Outlander was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and off-road capability. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, poor fuel economy, and unreliable transmission.
