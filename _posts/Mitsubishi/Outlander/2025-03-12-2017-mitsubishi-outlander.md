The 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact crossover SUV offering seating for up to seven passengers. It came with three engine options: a 2.0L 4-cylinder engine (148 hp, 145 lb-ft of torque), a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine (166 hp, 162 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L V6 engine (224 hp, 215 lb-ft of torque). The 2.0L engine was only available on the base model and paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. The 2.4L engine was paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). The 3.0L V6 engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Outlander's affordable price point and available third-row seating. Common complaints revolve around its lackluster fuel economy, especially with the V6, and perceived lack of power from the 4-cylinder engines.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4-Cylinder**
*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation during acceleration or the engine stalling, particularly at lower speeds or when idling. This can sometimes be related to fuel delivery or ignition issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair may involve checking and cleaning the mass airflow sensor, replacing spark plugs, or addressing issues with the fuel pump or injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common concern reported by some owners. Leaks may originate from valve cover gaskets, oil pan gaskets, or the front crankshaft seal.

**Transmission**

**CVT (2.4L Engine)**
*   **CVT Transmission Juddering/Shaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing juddering or shaking from the CVT transmission, particularly during acceleration or at lower speeds. This can be caused by degradation of the transmission fluid or internal wear within the CVT.
    *   Solution: Performing a CVT fluid flush with the correct Mitsubishi-specified fluid is often recommended as a first step. In more severe cases, the CVT may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ for fluid flush; $3,000 - $6,000+ for repair/replacement.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted that the rear suspension can sag over time, especially when carrying heavier loads or passengers in the third row.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and/or springs can help restore proper ride height and handling. Upgrading to heavy-duty components may be necessary for those who frequently carry heavier loads.

**Summary**

The 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander has a mix of potential issues ranging from relatively minor to more significant. The CVT transmission issues, particularly with the 2.4L engine, can be costly to repair or replace. Engine oil leaks, electrical problems, and sunroof leaks are also relatively common. While some problems may be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, others could lead to substantial repair bills. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used Outlander before purchasing.
