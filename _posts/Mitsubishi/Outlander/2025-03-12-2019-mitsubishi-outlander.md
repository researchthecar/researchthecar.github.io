The 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV that offers seating for up to seven passengers, making it a popular choice for families. It comes with two engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 166 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter V6 producing 224 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 3.0L V6 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Outlander for its affordability and standard features, while some criticisms include its lackluster performance and dated interior.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
