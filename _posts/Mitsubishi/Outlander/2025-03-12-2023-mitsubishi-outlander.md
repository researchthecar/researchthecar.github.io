The 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander represents a significant redesign for the popular compact SUV. It's known for its distinctive styling, standard third-row seating (though cramped), and generous warranty. However, some owners have reported issues with various aspects of the vehicle. Available powertrains include a 2.5L inline-4 engine (181 hp and 181 lb-ft of torque) paired with a CVT transmission and a Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) version. Common praises include the Outlander's modern interior and comfortable ride. Criticisms often center on the base engine's lackluster performance and the PHEV's limited all-electric range.

**Engine**

**2.5L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine misfires, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and potential stalling. The check engine light may illuminate with codes related to misfires (e.g., P0300, P0301-P0304). This can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, and performing compression tests. Replacement of faulty components resolves the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the number of components that need replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than usual, low oil level warnings, and in severe cases, engine damage.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair can be complex and may involve replacing piston rings or other engine components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electric Motor**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Jerky Acceleration/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint involves jerky acceleration, especially at lower speeds, or hesitation when accelerating from a stop. This is often attributed to the CVT's operating characteristics.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT software update from the dealer can improve the transmission's behavior. However, in severe cases, CVT replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Noisy Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clunking or rattling noises emanating from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This may be due to loose or worn suspension components.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn or loose suspension components, such as sway bar links, bushings, or struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the parts that need replacing
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Several owners have experienced issues with the infotainment system, including freezing, crashing, slow response times, or Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Attempting a system reset is often the first step. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the infotainment unit might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with ADAS features like lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, or blind-spot monitoring. These systems may malfunction, provide false alerts, or fail to activate altogether.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty sensor or module. Recalibration or replacement of the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the system and part involved
    *   Recalls:
    * 24V390000

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Tailgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported issues with the automatic tailgate, including failure to open or close properly, getting stuck mid-cycle, or unresponsive to the button or key fob commands.
    *   Solution: Check the tailgate struts, sensors, and motor for damage or malfunction. Replacement of the faulty component resolves the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the part that needs replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Third-Row Seat Latch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have found difficulty in folding or unfolding the third-row seats due to sticking or malfunctioning latches.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the latch mechanism may resolve the issue. If the latch is damaged, replacement might be necessary.

**Summary**

The 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander has drawn both praise and criticism. While its styling, features, and warranty are attractive, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues reported by owners. Engine misfires and oil consumption in the 2.5L engine, CVT transmission quirks, electrical glitches, and malfunctioning ADAS systems are some of the more concerning issues. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. Careful inspection and a thorough test drive are recommended before purchasing a used 2023 Outlander. It's also advisable to check for any applicable recalls or technical service bulletins (TSBs) related to these issues.
