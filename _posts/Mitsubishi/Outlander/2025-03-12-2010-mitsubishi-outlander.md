The 2010 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV that offers practicality and versatility. It came with three engine options: a 2.4L 4-cylinder (168 hp and 167 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L V6 (230 hp and 215 lb-ft of torque), and, later in the model year, a revised 3.0L V6 (220 hp and 204 lb-ft of torque). The 2.4L engine was paired with a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission), while the 3.0L V6 was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Outlander's spacious interior and available third-row seating (on some models), but some complain about its somewhat unrefined ride and handling, as well as its fuel economy with the V6 engine.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report the 2.4L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, sometimes requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust can also be present, a clear sign of burning oil.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings can address the issue. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail prematurely, leading to rough running, a check engine light, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Paired with 2.4L Engine)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: CVT transmission can fail prematurely, exhibiting symptoms such as slipping, hesitation during acceleration, jerky movements, or a complete loss of power.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change and reset of the transmission control module (TCM) may help. However, in many cases, a CVT replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 3.0L V6 Engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing rough or erratic shifting, especially between certain gears. Transmission slippage during acceleration may also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement or complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, especially when carrying heavy loads. This can negatively affect ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks and/or springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Out Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from suspension while driving or when going over bumps, bouncy ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacing the struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Fuel Gauge**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel gauge may read inaccurately, either showing full when it's not, or empty when there is still fuel in the tank.
    *   Solution: Replacing the fuel level sending unit (located in the fuel tank).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor only works on certain speeds, or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop around the license plate lights and seams of the rear hatch.
    *   Solution: Sanding, rust treatment, and repainting the affected area. In severe cases, hatch replacement may be necessary.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Mitsubishi Outlander presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. While the vehicle offers practicality with its available third-row seating and spacious interior, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that owners have reported. The most concerning problems involve the engine (especially excessive oil consumption on the 2.4L and timing chain issues on the 3.0L), and the CVT transmission, which can be prone to premature failure. These repairs can be quite costly, potentially ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Other issues, like suspension wear and electrical glitches, are less severe but should still be inspected. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended to assess the vehicle's overall condition and identify any potential problems before committing to a purchase.
