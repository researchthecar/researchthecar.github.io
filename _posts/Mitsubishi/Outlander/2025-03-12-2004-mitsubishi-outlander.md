The 2004 Mitsubishi Outlander was one of Mitsubishi's first forays into the compact SUV market. It offered two engine options: a 2.4L 4G64 SOHC 16-valve inline-4 producing 140 hp and 147 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.4L 4G69 MIVEC SOHC 16-valve inline-4 producing 160 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Outlander's affordability and cargo space, while common complaints include its somewhat lackluster fuel economy and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4G64 SOHC 16-valve inline-4**

* **Engine Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, especially at idle and during acceleration.  Can lead to premature wear of other components due to increased stress.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn or broken engine mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**2.4L 4G69 MIVEC SOHC 16-valve inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms:  The engine burns oil at a higher rate than normal, requiring frequent oil top-offs.  May also notice blueish smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution:  Depending on the cause (worn valve stem seals, piston rings), the solution can range from replacing the seals to a complete engine rebuild.  A leakdown test can help diagnose the cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated (often with a P0420 code), decreased engine performance, and potentially a failed emissions test.
    * Solution: Replacing the catalytic converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms:  Rough or jerky shifts between gears, especially when cold. May be accompanied by a clunking noise.
    * Solution:  Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the issue persists, valve body issues or internal wear may require a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250 (fluid flush), $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed.  Can also experience delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    * Solution:  Similar to harsh shifting, start with a fluid flush.  If that doesn't resolve the issue, internal wear or a faulty torque converter is likely the cause, requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and longer stopping distances.  May also notice leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn struts and/or shocks.  Recommended to replace in pairs (both front or both rear) for optimal performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Broken or Worn Sway Bar Links**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.  Can negatively impact handling.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn or broken sway bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (per pair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard (battery, charging system), difficulty starting the vehicle, and eventually a completely dead battery.
    * Solution: Replacing the failed alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power windows operate slowly or erratically, or they may stop working altogether.  May hear a grinding noise when attempting to operate the window.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (per window)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the vehicle, stalling, hesitation during acceleration, or complete failure to start.
    * Solution: Replacing the fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, particularly on the rocker panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage. Common in areas with road salt.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of affected panels. Rust prevention treatments.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on severity

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement or using a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000+

**Summary**

The 2004 Mitsubishi Outlander has a mix of potential issues ranging from moderate to severe. Engine and transmission issues can be costly to repair, especially if internal damage has occurred. Suspension and electrical problems are also common and can affect the vehicle's drivability and safety. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Overall, the Outlander can be a decent vehicle if properly maintained, but potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and have a pre-purchase inspection performed.
