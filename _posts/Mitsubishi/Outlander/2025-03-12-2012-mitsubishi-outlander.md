The 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV that offers a blend of practicality and affordability. Available engines include a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine producing 230 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. The 4-cylinder is paired with a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) while the V6 is mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Outlander for its available third-row seating and fuel economy (especially with the 4-cylinder), but some criticize its lackluster interior and driving dynamics.
