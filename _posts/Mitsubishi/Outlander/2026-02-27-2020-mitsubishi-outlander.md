# 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander

### Overview
The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander, particularly in its North American configurations, generally presents a respectable reliability profile for its class.

The vehicle's powertrain options, primarily the 2.4L naturally aspirated four-cylinder and the optional 3.0L V6 (though less common in later models), have proven to be reasonably durable. Attention to routine maintenance is key to ensuring long-term performance and avoiding common, albeit minor, issues that can arise with any vehicle.
