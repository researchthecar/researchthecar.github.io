The 2021 Mitsubishi Outlander marked a significant redesign for the model, moving to a new platform and offering a more refined experience. It is equipped with a 2.5-liter inline-four engine producing 181 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While many appreciate its updated styling, improved interior, and available features, some common complaints revolve around the CVT's performance, infotainment system glitches, and certain interior component issues.
