The 2008 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV that offers a blend of practicality and affordability. Two engine options were available: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 168 hp and 167 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 generating 220 hp and 204 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L was paired with a CVT, while the V6 came with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Outlander's spacious interior and available third-row seating, but some criticize its fuel economy and somewhat unrefined driving experience.

Engine issues, particularly oil consumption in the 2.4L and timing chain problems in the 3.0L, can be a concern. The CVT transmission is prone to failure, representing a potentially large expense. Suspension and electrical issues are also frequently reported. Overall, the Outlander has the potential to be a reliable vehicle, but prospective buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, including budgeting for potential repairs.
