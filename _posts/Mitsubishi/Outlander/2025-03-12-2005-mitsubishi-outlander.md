The 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander was a compact SUV offering practicality and decent fuel economy. The most common engine option was a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine producing around 160 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. A 3.0L V6 engine producing around 200 horsepower and 204 lb-ft of torque was also available. The 2.4L engine was typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L was paired with a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Outlander's affordability and cargo space but dislike its somewhat dated styling and occasionally unrefined driving experience.

**Summary**

The 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander presents a mix of potentially costly and less severe issues. Engine issues like catalytic converter failure and oil leaks are common and can be expensive to repair. Transmission problems, particularly in the 4-speed automatic paired with the 2.4L engine, can also lead to significant repair bills. Suspension and electrical problems are more typical of older vehicles, and their repair costs are generally moderate. Rust can be a major concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor in potential repair costs.
