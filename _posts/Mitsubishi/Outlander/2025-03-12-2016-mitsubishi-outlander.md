The 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact crossover SUV that offers seating for up to seven passengers with the optional third-row seat. Engine options include a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine producing 166 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 224 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Outlander for its fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.4L), available third-row seating, and price point. Common dislikes include the unrefined CVT transmission, lack of power from the 2.4L engine (especially when fully loaded), and somewhat dated interior.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Engine (4J12)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, a burning oil smell, and potentially engine damage if left unchecked.
    * Solution: The solution depends on the severity. It could involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature timing chain wear or failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup, and potential engine misfires or stalling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially other related components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6 Engine (6B31)**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Visible oil spots under the vehicle and a burning oil smell are common symptoms.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak.

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) - 2.4L Engine**

* **Shuddering/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many owners report shuddering, hesitation, or jerky acceleration, especially at low speeds or during initial acceleration. The CVT may feel like it's "searching" for the right gear ratio.
    * Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change may alleviate the issue. However, more severe cases may require CVT valve body replacement or a complete CVT replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Premature Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature CVT failure. Symptoms can include loud whining noises, slipping, inability to accelerate, and eventual complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the CVT.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission - 3.0L Engine**

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension may sag prematurely, especially when carrying passengers or cargo. This can lead to a rough ride and reduced handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear springs and/or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently. This can result in difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery.
    * Solution: Check for parasitic draws (aftermarket accessories, faulty modules) and replace the battery if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the cause and battery replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Multimedia System/Navigation Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The multimedia system may freeze, reboot unexpectedly, or experience connectivity issues. Navigation may also be inaccurate or unresponsive.
    * Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. More severe cases may require replacement of the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust (Specifically around the rear wheel wells)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust developing around the rear wheel wells, especially in areas with harsh winters or road salt usage.
    * Solution: Repairing the rust and repainting the affected areas.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per wheel well (depending on the severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

**Summary**

The 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander, while offering some appealing features, has several potential issues to be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission paired with the 2.4L engine, which can experience shuddering, hesitation, and even premature failure, leading to costly repairs. Other potential issues include excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine, oil leaks in the 3.0L engine, rear suspension sag, electrical problems, and rust. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite severe and lead to substantial repair bills. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic, and be prepared for the possibility of encountering some of these common problems.
