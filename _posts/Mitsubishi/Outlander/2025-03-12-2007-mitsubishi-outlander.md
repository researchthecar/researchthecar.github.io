The 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander was a compact SUV offering practicality and decent fuel economy. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 (168 hp, 167 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L V6 (220 hp, 204 lb-ft of torque). The 2.4L was paired with a CVT, while the V6 came with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the Outlander's spacious interior and available third-row seating (on some models), while common complaints revolved around its unrefined CVT transmission, some reliability issues, and mediocre fuel economy from the V6.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust, a burning oil smell, and/or low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: The issue could stem from worn piston rings or valve seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the problem. Depending on the severity, the fix could range from replacing valve seals to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of timing chain stretch or failure, leading to rough running, loss of power, and potential engine damage. Symptoms can include a rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup, and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to timing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (2.4L Engine)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission is known to be problematic, with reports of premature failure. Symptoms include shuddering, slipping, hesitation during acceleration, and the transmission entering limp mode.
    *   Solution: In many cases, the only solution is to replace the CVT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (3.0L Engine)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or delayed shifting, especially between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush may help in some cases. However, if the issue persists, it could indicate worn internal components requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350 (fluid flush), $2000 - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, particularly if the vehicle is frequently used for towing or carrying heavy loads. This can result in a rough ride and reduced handling.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, while offering practicality, is prone to several issues, particularly with the CVT transmission (for 2.4L models) and potential engine problems. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor electrical faults to major engine or transmission failures, with repair costs potentially reaching thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, check its maintenance history, and be aware of these common problems.
