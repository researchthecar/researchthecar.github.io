The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact crossover SUV offering seating for up to seven passengers in some configurations. It's available with a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 166 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, paired with a CVT transmission, or a 3.0L V6 engine producing 224 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Outlander's affordable price point and available third-row seating, but common complaints include lackluster fuel economy, unimpressive performance from the base engine, and a somewhat dated interior design.

The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander has several potential issues, with the most significant concerning the CVT transmission coupled with the 2.4L engine, which is prone to failure and costly to replace. Oil consumption in the 2.4L engine is also a concern. Other issues, such as suspension wear and electrical problems, are less severe but still warrant attention. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a used 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander.
