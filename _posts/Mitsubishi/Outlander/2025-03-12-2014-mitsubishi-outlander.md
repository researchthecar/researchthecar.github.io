The 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact crossover SUV offering seating for up to seven passengers (on models equipped with the third row). Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 166 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine producing 224 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), while the 3.0L V6 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Outlander's fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.4L engine), spacious interior, and available third-row seating. Common complaints include lackluster acceleration with the 2.4L engine, unrefined CVT performance, and some concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder Engine**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, engine knocking, or noticeable reduction in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: The fix can vary depending on the cause. Some have had success with switching to a different oil viscosity or brand. More severe cases may require engine repair or replacement of piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The mass airflow sensor can fail, causing the engine to run rough, stall, or have poor fuel economy. The check engine light will often illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MAF sensor.
