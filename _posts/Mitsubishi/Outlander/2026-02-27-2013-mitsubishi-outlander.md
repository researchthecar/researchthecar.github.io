# 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander

### Overview
The 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander, particularly in its North American configurations, generally presents a respectable reliability record for its model year. It was offered with a choice of two main gasoline engines: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and a more powerful 3.0-liter V6, paired with either a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) or a traditional automatic transmission. While not without its minor quirks, the Outlander of this generation is often praised for its practicality and decent fuel economy. Owners typically report satisfaction with its performance and durability, with most issues falling into the realm of common maintenance rather than widespread design flaws. This analysis focuses on documented common issues beyond routine wear and tear.
