The 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV known for its relatively spacious interior, available third-row seating (on some trims), and reasonable fuel economy. Engine options include a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter V6 generating 230 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. The Outlander is praised for its value and practicality, but criticized for its somewhat unrefined driving experience and occasionally lackluster interior materials. Common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with certain drivetrain components, and the overall build quality.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil at a higher rate than normal, requiring frequent oil top-offs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust. Can lead to engine damage if left unchecked.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings and valve seals can resolve the issue. In severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on cold starts. Potential for decreased engine performance and eventually engine failure if the timing chain stretches or breaks.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioners is the recommended fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) - paired with 2.4L Inline-4**

*   **CVT Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation upon acceleration, slipping, shuddering, and overall poor performance. Can eventually lead to complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change and reset of the transmission control module (TCM) can improve performance. However, often the solution is a complete CVT replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic - paired with 3.0L V6**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than the front, especially when loaded. Can affect handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear springs and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can cause loose handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Electronic Control Unit (ECU)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting problems, engine misfires, and erratic instrument panel readings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ECU and reprogramming it to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on the Body**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the lower body panels, wheel wells, and around door edges, especially in areas with harsh winters or salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repairing the rust by sanding, treating, and repainting the affected areas. Severe rust may require panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air coming from the vents. Common causes include a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a clogged evaporator.
    *   Solution: Repairing the refrigerant leak, replacing the compressor, or cleaning the evaporator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Sunroof Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof getting stuck, leaking, or making unusual noises.
    * Solution: Repairing the sunroof motor, track, or seals, or replacing the entire sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander can present owners with a variety of issues, ranging from moderate to severe. Engine and transmission problems, especially with the CVT paired with the 2.4L engine, can be costly. Suspension and electrical issues are also relatively common. Rust can be a concern, particularly in areas with harsh climates. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems and be prepared for potential repair costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures that can cost thousands to repair, making a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic highly recommended.
