The 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and available third-row seating. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 166 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine that produces 224 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the 3.0L V6 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**
The 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander can be a good value for those needing a fuel-efficient SUV with available third-row seating. However, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the CVT transmission in models equipped with the 2.4L engine. The engine stalling and battery drain problems can be inconvenient and costly to address. Rust on wheel arches and undercarriage can also be a concern, especially in regions with harsh weather conditions. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs like CVT replacement or engine work can be quite costly, making it important to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
