The 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact crossover SUV offering seating for up to seven passengers. It comes with a few engine options: a 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 166 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter V6 generating 224 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L is paired with a CVT transmission, while the V6 uses a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Outlander's affordable price, spacious interior, and available third-row seating. Common complaints include lackluster fuel economy (especially with the V6), uninspired handling, and some concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Running**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and reduced power. The check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause of the misfire is crucial. This may involve replacing faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. A compression test can identify potential issues with valves or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the failed component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an unusually high amount of oil between oil changes. Low oil levels can trigger the oil pressure warning light.
    *   Solution: In some cases, using a heavier weight oil or addressing minor leaks can mitigate the issue. However, more severe cases may require piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+ (depending on the cause and required repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (2.4L Engine)**

*   **CVT Transmission Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky acceleration, hesitation during gear changes, and a general lack of smoothness.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid change using the correct Mitsubishi-approved fluid. If the problem persists, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4500+ (depending on the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (3.0L Engine)**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear, and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components, such as struts, shocks, sway bar links, and bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Problems with the Touchscreen Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The touchscreen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or glitches. The system may randomly restart.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1000+ (depending on whether the system can be updated or needs replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car is difficult to start or the battery is dead after sitting for a short period.
    *   Solution: Have the charging system tested, including the alternator and battery. Check for parasitic drains caused by faulty modules or accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion on the liftgate**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust and corrosion around the license plate lights or handle.
    *   Solution: Remove rust and repaint the liftgate.
