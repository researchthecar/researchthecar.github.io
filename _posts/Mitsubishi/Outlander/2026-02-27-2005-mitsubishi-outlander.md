### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander presents a reasonable value proposition for a used compact SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 2.4L engine, while generally dependable, can suffer from oil leaks and the critical timing belt requires timely replacement. Automatic transmissions may develop shifting problems, and manual clutches will eventually need service. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also known wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with power windows and alternators, can occur. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior issues like HVAC blower resistors and dashboard cracking are also documented. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Outlanders have provided reliable service with diligent maintenance and timely repairs.
