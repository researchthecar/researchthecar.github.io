**Introduction**

The 2021 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV that offers a well-rounded package with a spacious interior, advanced safety features, and a capable powertrain. It is available with three engine options: a base 2.5-liter four-cylinder, a 3.0-liter V6, and a plug-in hybrid powertrain. The 2.5-liter engine produces 181 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0-liter V6 delivers 224 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an eight-speed continuously variable transmission (CVT). The plug-in hybrid powertrain combines a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with two electric motors, producing a combined output of 227 horsepower.

Some strengths of the 2021 Mitsubishi Outlander include its roomy interior, comfortable seats, and excellent fuel economy for the base 2.5-liter engine. However, some drawbacks to the vehicle include a lack of power from the 2.5-liter engine, a somewhat lackluster handling experience, and a few reported issues with its reliability.
