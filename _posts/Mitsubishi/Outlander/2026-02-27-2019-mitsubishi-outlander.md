# 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander

### Overview
The 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV known for its practicality and value. It offers a choice between two main powertrains: a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine and a more powerful 3.0-liter V6 engine, both paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for the 2.4L and a 6-speed automatic for the 3.0L. Reliability data for the 2019 model year indicates a generally solid performance, with most reported issues being minor or related to specific component failures rather than widespread systemic problems. Owners generally appreciate its comfortable ride and spacious interior, making it a suitable option for families and daily commuting. However, like any vehicle, some areas warrant attention to ensure long-term dependability.
