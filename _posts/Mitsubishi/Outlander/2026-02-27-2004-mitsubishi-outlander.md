### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mitsubishi Outlander is a generally reliable vehicle for its age, but common issues tend to surface with mileage. The 2.4L engine can experience oil leaks and, less commonly, timing belt issues, which are critical to address. Automatic transmissions may develop slipping problems, and manual clutches will eventually wear out. Suspension components like struts and sway bar links are typical wear items that can cause noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as power window failures and alternator issues, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any developing symptoms are key to maintaining the Outlander's reliability.
