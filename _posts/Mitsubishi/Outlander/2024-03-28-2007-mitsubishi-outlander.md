**2007 Mitsubishi Outlander**

The 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV that offers a balance of versatility, practicality, and performance. It is available with a choice of two engines: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 163 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque or a 3.0-liter V6 with 220 horsepower and 202 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a five-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission.

The Outlander's strengths include its spacious cabin, comfortable seating, and ample cargo space. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as its dated interior design, lackluster acceleration, and poor fuel economy.
