The 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander is a popular compact SUV known for its spacious three-row seating, stylish design, and comprehensive warranty. It comes standard with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 181 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While many owners appreciate its fuel efficiency, value, and comfortable ride, some have reported issues impacting the ownership experience.

**Engine**

**2.5L Four-Cylinder Engine**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.5L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, a burning oil smell, and potentially blue-tinted exhaust smoke.
    * Solution: Mitsubishi has not issued a formal TSB, but dealerships typically recommend monitoring oil consumption and performing an oil consumption test. Potential fixes may include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in severe cases, replacing the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+ depending on the severity and required repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience engine stalling or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be intermittent and may be accompanied by a lack of power.
    * Solution: The issue may be related to fuel delivery, ignition, or sensor malfunctions. Diagnosis involves checking the fuel pump, fuel injectors, spark plugs, and various sensors such as the mass airflow (MAF) sensor and oxygen sensors. Repair may include replacing the faulty component or reprogramming the engine control unit (ECU).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting or jerking, especially during low-speed acceleration or deceleration. This can manifest as a noticeable lurch or hesitation.
    *   Solution: The issue is often addressed by performing a CVT fluid flush and software update of the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, the valve body or even the entire CVT may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $5,000+ (CVT replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Catastrophic CVT failure can occur. Symptoms include loud noises, inability to accelerate, and complete loss of drive.
    * Solution: CVT replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealership is often required to address this issue. If that does not work, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, leading to a dead battery, especially after the vehicle has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: The issue is usually caused by an electrical parasitic draw. Technicians will need to perform a parasitic draw test to identify the circuit causing the battery drain and troubleshoot from there.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed excessive rattling and squeaking noises emanating from various interior components, such as the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    *   Solution: The issue is usually resolved by identifying the source of the noise and applying sound-deadening material or tightening loose components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the source and complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Third-Row Seat Access Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have found accessing the third-row seats to be difficult, especially for adults, due to limited space and an awkward folding mechanism.
    *   Solution: There is no specific fix for this issue, as it is inherent to the vehicle's design. Owners may need to consider alternative vehicles with more accessible third-row seating if this is a major concern.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Liftgate Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic liftgate may fail to open or close properly, become stuck, or emit unusual noises.
    *   Solution: This issue can be caused by faulty sensors, a malfunctioning motor, or damaged struts. Repair may involve replacing the affected component or recalibrating the liftgate system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander has some potential issues, with the engine and transmission being the most concerning due to potential high repair costs. Electrical and interior issues are relatively minor and less expensive to fix. Overall, the Outlander has above-average reliability, but it is still important to be aware of these common issues and potential repair costs before purchasing a used vehicle. Owners should pay close attention to engine oil consumption, transmission behavior, and the functionality of electronic systems to address any problems early on.
