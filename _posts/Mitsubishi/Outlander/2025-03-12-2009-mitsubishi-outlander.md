The 2009 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV that offers versatility and decent fuel economy. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 generating 220 horsepower and 204 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options vary based on the engine; the 2.4L is typically paired with a CVT, while the 3.0L comes with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Outlander's spacious interior and available third-row seating (on some models), but common complaints include subpar fuel economy (especially with the V6), and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating frequently.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. If the issue persists or worsens, a mechanic can perform an oil consumption test to diagnose the cause. If piston rings are the culprit, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain tensioner may wear prematurely, leading to a loose timing chain. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, especially upon startup, and potential misfires or rough running.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (paired with 2.4L Inline-4)**

*   **CVT Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: CVT transmissions can experience issues like slipping, hesitation, or complete failure. Warning lights may illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the CVT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.0L V6)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or harsh shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush, solenoid replacement, or complete transmission replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Weakness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, especially if the vehicle is frequently used for carrying heavy loads or towing. This can lead to a less comfortable ride and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear springs and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm or sway bar bushings can cause clunking noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining overnight, even when the vehicle is not in use.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw (e.g., faulty module, aftermarket accessory). Repair or replacement of the offending component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working or operate intermittently. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, switch, or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window motor, switch, or repair of the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on various parts of the vehicle, especially in areas prone to salt exposure (e.g., rocker panels, wheel wells).
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting. In severe cases, replacement of affected body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may blow warm air or fail to cool the cabin adequately. Common causes include a refrigerant leak, faulty compressor, or malfunctioning blend door actuator.

**Summary**

The 2009 Mitsubishi Outlander has several potential issues. Engine problems range from manageable oil consumption in the 2.4L to more serious timing chain issues in the 3.0L. The CVT transmission is a notable concern due to its potential for failure. Suspension weakness and electrical issues are also common. While some problems are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like transmission or engine work, can be costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and obtain a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing or potential problems.
