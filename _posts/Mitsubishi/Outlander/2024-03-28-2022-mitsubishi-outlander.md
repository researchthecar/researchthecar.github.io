**Introduction:**

The 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander is a midsize SUV that offers a bold design and a spacious cabin. It is available with two engine options: a 2.5-liter inline-four producing 181 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter V6 producing 294 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT).
