The 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV offering a balance of practicality and affordability. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 generating 230 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine is paired with a CVT transmission, while the V6 uses a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Outlander's fuel economy (especially with the 2.4L), spacious cargo area, and available third-row seating. Common dislikes include lackluster interior materials, unrefined engine noise, and sometimes problematic electronics.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls unexpectedly, particularly at idle or low speeds. This may be caused by a faulty Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor or issues with the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve.
    *   Solution: Replace the MAF sensor or clean/replace the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormal amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Depending on the cause (worn piston rings, valve stem seals), the engine may require a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+

**3.0L V6**
*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the valve cover gasket, resulting in a burning smell and potential oil drips.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

**Transmission**

**CVT (paired with 2.4L Inline-4)**
*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission experiences slipping, hesitation, or complete failure. This can manifest as a lack of acceleration, shuddering during gear changes, or the inability to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace the CVT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.0L V6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission exhibits harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This may be due to worn-out solenoids or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replace the transmission fluid and/or solenoids. A full transmission rebuild may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Out Struts/Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll during cornering, and/or leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts/shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than the front. Particularly noticeable when loaded with cargo or passengers.
    * Solution: Replace rear springs or install helper springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows stop working, often intermittently. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not in use. This may be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the problem)
*   **Bluetooth Connectivity Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bluetooth connection is unreliable, drops frequently, or fails to pair with devices.
    *   Solution: Update the car's infotainment system software (if available) or replace the Bluetooth module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is forming on the vehicle's undercarriage, particularly in areas exposed to road salt and moisture.
    *   Solution: Clean and treat the rust, then apply a protective coating to prevent further corrosion. In severe cases, welding may be required to repair damaged areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on severity)

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light illuminates on the dashboard, indicating a potential issue with the airbag system.
    *   Solution: Have the airbag system diagnosed by a qualified technician. The issue may be a faulty sensor, wiring problem, or a malfunctioning airbag module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
*   **AC Not Blowing Cold**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioner blows warm air instead of cold. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Repair the refrigerant leak, replace the faulty compressor, or replace the malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+

**Recalls:**

**Summary**

The 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander has a mix of issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical problems to more serious engine and transmission failures. The most concerning issues involve the CVT transmission (2.4L engine) and potential for engine damage with the 2.4L due to oil consumption, which can be costly to repair. While some suspension and electrical issues are common for vehicles of this age, potential buyers should be aware of the more significant problems and have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic prior to purchase. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but being informed can help buyers make a sound decision and budget for potential repairs.
