The 2014 Mitsubishi ASX, also known as the Outlander Sport in some markets, is a compact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. In North America, the most common engine option is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the ASX's value for money, maneuverability, and fuel economy, while common dislikes include its somewhat underpowered engine, basic interior, and road noise.
