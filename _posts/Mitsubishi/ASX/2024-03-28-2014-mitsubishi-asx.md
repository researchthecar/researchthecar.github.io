**Introduction**
The 2014 Mitsubishi ASX is a compact SUV that offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and a variety of engine and transmission options. It comes with a 2.0-liter, 148-horsepower engine paired with a 5-speed manual or CVT transmission, or a 2.4-liter, 168-horsepower engine paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The ASX has received praise for its fuel efficiency, handling, and attractive exterior, but some owners have reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**
**2.0-Liter Engine with 5-Speed Manual Transmission**
* **Engine Oil Leaking from Gasket:** Oil may leak from the valve cover gasket, causing a burning smell and reduced oil levels. Replacing the gasket resolves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300+

* **Piston Ring Failure:** Piston rings can fail, leading to excessive oil consumption and blue smoke from the exhaust. Engine rebuild or replacement is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000-$5,000+

**2.0-Liter Engine with CVT Transmission**
* **CVT Transmission Grinding:** The CVT transmission may develop a grinding noise, especially when shifting gears or at low speeds. Replacing the transmission is generally required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000-$4,000+

**2.4-Liter Engine with 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**
* **Timing Belt Tensioner Failure:** The timing belt tensioner can fail, causing the timing belt to jump or break. This can lead to severe engine damage. Replacing the tensioner and timing belt is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000+

**Transmission**
**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
* **Gear Grinding:** Gears may grind or become difficult to shift, especially when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear. Repair involves replacing worn gears or synchronizers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000

**CVT Transmission**
* **Slipping Gears:** The CVT transmission may slip gears, resulting in loss of power and increased fuel consumption. Software updates or transmission replacement may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2,000+

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**
* **Delayed Shifting:** The transmission may delay or hesitate when shifting gears. Updating the transmission software or replacing the transmission solenoids may resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+

**Suspension**
* **Front Suspension Strut Failure:** The front suspension struts can wear out prematurely, leading to a bumpy ride, excessive tire wear, and decreased handling. Replacing the struts is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600-$1,000+

**Electrical**
* **Battery Drain:** The battery may drain quickly, even when the vehicle is turned off. Fixing the parasitic drain or replacing the battery usually solves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail, causing the battery not to charge properly. Replacing the alternator is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$800+

* **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch may fail, causing the headlights to not work or to turn on and off intermittently. Replacing the switch resolves the problem. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400+

**Exterior**
* **Sunroof Drain Plugs Leaking:** The sunroof drain plugs may leak, allowing water to enter the cabin. Cleaning or replacing the drain plugs stops the leak. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200

* **Tailgate Hatch Not Opening:** The tailgate hatch may become stuck or difficult to open. Lubricating the latch or replacing the actuator solves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+

**Interior**
* **Climate Control Fan Not Working:** The climate control fan may stop working, resulting in a lack of air conditioning or heat. Replacing the fan motor or blower resistor is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+

* **Dashboard Rattling:** The dashboard may rattle or make noise over bumps. Tightening loose components or replacing the dashboard is usually required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$400+

**Summary**
While the 2014 Mitsubishi ASX offers good fuel efficiency, handling, and a spacious interior, it has been reported to have several issues, particularly with the engine, CVT transmission, and suspension. Some repairs can be costly, such as engine rebuilds or transmission replacements. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider the cost of repairs when making a decision.
