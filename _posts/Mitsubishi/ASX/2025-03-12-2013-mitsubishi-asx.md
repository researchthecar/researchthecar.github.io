The 2013 Mitsubishi ASX, also known as the Outlander Sport in some markets, is a compact crossover SUV that offers a blend of fuel efficiency and practicality. In the North American market, the 2013 ASX was primarily offered with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the ASX for its affordability and fuel economy, but often cite its underpowered engine and somewhat bland interior as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**2.0L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or seeing blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and using a higher viscosity oil may temporarily alleviate the issue. The root cause could be worn piston rings or valve seals, requiring engine repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and repair method.

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration felt in the cabin, particularly at idle or during acceleration. Knocking or clunking noises may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn or damaged engine mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, or hesitation during acceleration. The transmission may also make unusual noises or fail to shift properly, sometimes resulting in complete loss of power.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid changes are recommended, but if the damage is severe, replacement or rebuild of the CVT is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+

*   **CVT Cooler Line Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fluid leaks, often visible under the vehicle. Can lead to low CVT fluid levels and potential transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking CVT cooler lines and topping off the fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, reduced handling stability, and clunking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially overnight, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the parasitic drain by testing individual circuits and replacing the faulty component (e.g., faulty relay, malfunctioning module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **Central Locking Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Central locking system fails to lock or unlock the doors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch struggles to stay open and falls down.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2013 Mitsubishi ASX presents owners with a mix of potential issues, ranging from moderate to severe. Engine oil consumption and CVT problems are the most concerning due to their potential for high repair costs. Suspension issues, electrical faults, and exterior trim problems are typically less expensive to address. Overall, prospective buyers should have the vehicle thoroughly inspected, paying close attention to the condition of the engine, transmission, and suspension components to avoid costly repairs down the road.
