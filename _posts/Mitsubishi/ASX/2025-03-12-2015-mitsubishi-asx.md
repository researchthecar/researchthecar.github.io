The 2015 Mitsubishi ASX is a compact crossover SUV known in some markets as the Outlander Sport or RVR. The North American market typically featured a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing around 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Some models were also available with a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners generally appreciate the ASX for its fuel economy and compact size, making it easy to maneuver and park. Common complaints revolve around lackluster acceleration, especially with the 2.0-liter engine and CVT combination, and some concerns about interior material quality.
