### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mitsubishi Diamante is a generally reliable vehicle, with its V6 engine and automatic transmission proving to be fairly robust. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as timing belt maintenance, oil leaks from valve cover gaskets, and occasional transmission slipping. Electrical components like power window regulators and instrument clusters can also develop faults.
