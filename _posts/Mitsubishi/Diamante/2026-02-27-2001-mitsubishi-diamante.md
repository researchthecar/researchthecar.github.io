### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mitsubishi Diamante offers a comfortable and stylish driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of common reliability concerns. The 3.5L V6 engine, while generally robust, can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and requires timely timing belt replacement to avoid catastrophic failure. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4-speed, may develop shifting issues over time.
