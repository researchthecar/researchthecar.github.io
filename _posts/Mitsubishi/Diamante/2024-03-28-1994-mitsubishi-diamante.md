**1994 Mitsubishi Diamante**

A mid-size luxury sedan, the 1994 Mitsubishi Diamante was offered with two engine and transmission options:

* **3.0L V6**: 175 horsepower, 185 lb-ft of torque
* **3.5L V6**: 210 horsepower, 224 lb-ft of torque

Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Diamante was praised for its comfortable interior, quiet ride, and impressive performance. However, it also had some issues that owners have reported.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6**

* **Head gasket failure**: Blown head gaskets can cause symptoms such as overheating, coolant leaks, and white smoke from the exhaust. The solution involves replacing the head gasket and possibly the cylinder head if it has been damaged. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,500+.
* **Timing belt failure**: The timing belt is a critical component that keeps the engine's timing in sync. If it breaks, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. It is recommended to replace the timing belt and tensioner according to the manufacturer's maintenance schedule. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+.
* **Oil leaks**: Oil leaks can occur from various areas of the engine, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Replacing the leaking components is necessary to prevent low oil levels and potential engine damage. Estimated cost: $150 - $500+.

**3.5L V6**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping or jerking**: The transmission may fail to engage properly or shift smoothly. The solution often involves replacing the transmission filter and fluid, or rebuilding or replacing the transmission itself. Estimated cost: $800 - $2,500+.
* **No reverse gear**: The transmission may not engage reverse gear, making it impossible to move the vehicle backward. This issue may require replacing the reverse gear solenoid or the transmission control module. Estimated cost: $200 - $500+.
* **Fluid leaks**: Transmission fluid leaks can occur from the pan gasket, seals, or lines. Replacing the leaking components is necessary to prevent low fluid levels and transmission damage. Estimated cost: $100 - $300+.

**Suspension**

* **Strut and shock absorber failure**: Worn struts or shocks can lead to a rough ride, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Replacing the suspension components is necessary to restore ride quality and safety. Estimated cost: $400 - $800+ per axle.
* **Sway bar links worn out**: Broken or worn sway bar links can cause knocking or clunking noises while driving over bumps. Replacing the sway bar links is relatively inexpensive. Estimated cost: $100 - $200+ per link.
* **Ball joint failure**: Worn or damaged ball joints can make steering feel sloppy and increase tire wear. Replacing the ball joints is necessary to ensure safe handling. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+ per joint.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure**: A failing alternator may not properly charge the battery, leading to electrical issues or leaving the vehicle stranded. Replacing the alternator is necessary to ensure the electrical system functions properly. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+.
* **Battery drain**: A parasitic drain on the battery can lead to a dead battery and prevent the vehicle from starting. Finding and fixing the source of the drain is necessary to prevent ongoing battery issues. Estimated cost: $100 - $200+.
* **Electrical gremlins**: Various electrical issues can occur, such as malfunctioning gauges, lights, or windows. Troubleshooting the specific issue and repairing or replacing faulty components is necessary. Estimated cost: Varies depending on the issue.

**Exterior**

* **Tail light lens fading**: The plastic tail light lenses may fade or oxidize, reducing their illumination and visibility. Replacing the tail light assemblies is necessary to ensure proper rear lighting. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+.
* **Door lock actuator failure**: The door lock actuators may fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking. Replacing the actuators is necessary to restore door lock functionality. Estimated cost: $150 - $300+ per lock.
* **Sunroof failure**: The sunroof may fail to open or close properly, or it may leak water. Repairing or replacing the sunroof components is necessary to restore its functionality. Estimated cost: Varies depending on the issue.

**Interior**

* **Power window failure**: The power window motors or switches may fail, preventing the windows from rolling up or down. Replacing the faulty components is necessary to restore window functionality. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+ per window.
* **HVAC blower motor failure**: The HVAC blower motor may fail, resulting in a lack of heating or cooling in the cabin. Replacing the blower motor is necessary to restore climate control functionality. Estimated cost: $200 - $400+.
* **Dashboard cracking**: The dashboard may develop cracks or deform, especially in hot climates. Replacing or repairing the dashboard is necessary to restore the vehicle's interior aesthetics. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000+.

**Summary**

Overall, the 1994 Mitsubishi Diamante is a reliable and comfortable mid-size sedan. However, it is not without its issues. Some of the most common problems reported by owners include head gasket failure, transmission slipping or jerking, and suspension component failure. The severity and cost of repairs can vary depending on the issue, but some of the more serious issues can be expensive to fix.
