### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mitsubishi Diamante is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 3.5L V6 engine requires attention to its timing belt maintenance to prevent catastrophic failure. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4-speed, can experience slipping and torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure are also noted. On the exterior, paint degradation is common for vehicles of this age, and sunroofs can develop leaks. Interior climate control blend doors and power seat motors are other areas that may require attention. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and timely repairs, the Diamante can remain a comfortable and reliable vehicle.
