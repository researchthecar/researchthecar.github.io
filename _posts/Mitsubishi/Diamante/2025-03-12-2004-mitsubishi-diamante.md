The 2004 Mitsubishi Diamante is a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. It was only available with one engine option: a 3.5-liter V6 producing approximately 205 horsepower and 231 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the car for its smooth ride and reliability (when properly maintained) at the time, but some found the fuel economy lacking and the styling somewhat bland. Others have complained about the availability of parts as the vehicle ages.
