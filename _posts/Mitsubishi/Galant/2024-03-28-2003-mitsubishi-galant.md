**Introduction:**

The 2003 Mitsubishi Galant is a midsize sedan that was available with three different engine options and two different transmission options. The base engine was a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 140 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. The optional engines were a 3.0-liter V6 with 195 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5-liter V6 with 165 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine came with either a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual transmission. The 3.0-liter V6 engine came with a five-speed automatic transmission, and the 2.5-liter V6 engine came with a four-speed automatic transmission.
