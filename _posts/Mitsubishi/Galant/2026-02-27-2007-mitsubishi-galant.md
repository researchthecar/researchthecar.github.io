### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mitsubishi Galant presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly with the automatic transmission experiencing slipping or torque converter problems. Engine-related concerns include oil leaks and, for the timing belt, potential for significant damage if not maintained. Electrical components like the Body Control Module can be a source of frustration with intermittent failures. Exterior rust on lower body panels and interior issues such as HVAC blower motor failure are also noted. Regular maintenance, especially for the timing belt and transmission fluid, is crucial for mitigating some of these potential problems. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these common repair areas.
