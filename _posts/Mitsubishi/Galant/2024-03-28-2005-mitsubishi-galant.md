**Introduction:**

The 2005 Mitsubishi Galant was a midsize sedan available with a range of engine and transmission options. The base model featured a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 140 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. A 3.8-liter V6 with 230 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque was available on the higher trims, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission.

Drivers praised the Galant's spacious interior and comfortable ride, but criticized its weak base engine and lackluster handling.
