**Introduction:**

The 1999 Mitsubishi Galant is a midsize sedan that offers a balance of performance and affordability. It comes with a choice of two engine options: a 2.4L I4 and a 3.0L V6, paired with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. The I4 engine produces 145 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, while the V6 generates 190 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Reviewers praise the Galant for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price point. However, it has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.4L I4 with 4-Speed Automatic:**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak that leads to rough idling, poor fuel economy, and decreased power. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300+
* **Crankshaft Position (CKP) Sensor Failure:** The CKP sensor can fail, causing the engine to stall or fail to start. Solution: Replace the CKP sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250+
* **EGR Valve Sticking:** The EGR valve can stick, causing a reduction in fuel efficiency and performance. Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

**3.0L V6 with 4-Speed Automatic or 5-Speed Manual:**

* **Power Window Motor Failure:** The power window motors can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Solution: Replace the faulty motor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300+
* **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Failure:** The TCM may fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or fail to shift altogether. Solution: Replace the TCM. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
* **Rear Differential Failure:** The rear differential can fail, causing a loud whining or grinding noise, as well as a loss of power to the rear wheels. Solution: Replace the rear differential. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic:**

* **Transmission Slippage:** The transmission can experience slippage, resulting in a loss of power during acceleration or shifting. Solution: Replace the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+

**5-Speed Manual:**

**Summary:**

While the 1999 Mitsubishi Galant offers a comfortable ride and affordable price point, it has some potential reliability concerns. Common engine issues include intake manifold gasket failure, CKP sensor failure, and EGR valve sticking. The transmission may experience slippage, while the suspension can suffer from strut mount bearing and control arm bushing failure. Electrical problems range from alternator failure to ECU issues. Other notable issues include door handle corrosion, tail light circuit board failure, seat heater failure, and climate control failure. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the cost of repairs into their decision-making process.
