**Introduction**

The 1991 Mitsubishi Galant is a mid-size sedan that was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.0-liter inline-four that produced 135 horsepower and 160 lb-ft of torque. A 2.4-liter V6 that produced 164 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque was also available. Both engines were available with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Galant was praised for its roomy interior, comfortable ride, and well-equipped cabin. However, it was also criticized for its bland styling and lackluster performance.
