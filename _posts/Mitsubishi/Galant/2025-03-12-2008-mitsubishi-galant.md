The 2008 Mitsubishi Galant is a mid-size sedan that offered a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy for its time. Two engine options were available: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 producing 230 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Galant for its spacious interior and relatively affordable price point, but common complaints included uninspired styling, lackluster handling, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The issue might stem from worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source. Repairs may involve replacing the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks emanating from the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil buildup on the engine and potential burning smells.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: The issue might be caused by low transmission fluid, worn-out solenoids, or internal damage. A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor issues. However, more serious problems could necessitate a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush and filter, $1,500 - $3,500+ for rebuild or replacement.

**Summary**

The 2008 Mitsubishi Galant, while offering a comfortable and spacious interior, is prone to a few common issues. Engine issues such as oil consumption in the 2.4L and valve cover leaks in the 3.8L, along with transmission problems like harsh shifting, can be concerning. Suspension wear and electrical faults are also noted. Rust can be a significant problem, especially in regions with harsh winters. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively inexpensive fixes to more costly repairs, with some requiring extensive work. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be aware of these potential problems.
