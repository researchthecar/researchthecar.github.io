**Introduction**

The 1992 Mitsubishi Galant is a midsize sedan that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 120 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine is a 2.5-liter V6 that produces 164 horsepower and 183 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are mated to either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The Galant received praise for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and strong V6 engine. However, it was also criticized for its lack of performance from the 4-cylinder engine, poor fuel economy, and outdated interior.
