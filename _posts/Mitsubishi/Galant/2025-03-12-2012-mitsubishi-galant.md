The 2012 Mitsubishi Galant is a mid-size sedan known for its affordability and spacious interior. It was offered with a single engine option: a 2.4-liter inline-4 cylinder engine producing 160 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its comfortable ride and simple design, while others find its fuel economy and performance lacking compared to competitors. Common dislikes also include its outdated interior and limited features.
