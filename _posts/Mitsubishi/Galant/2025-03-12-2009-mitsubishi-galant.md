The 2009 Mitsubishi Galant is a mid-size sedan offering a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. Engine options included a 2.4L 4-cylinder producing 160 hp and 157 lb-ft of torque and a 3.8L V6 generating 230 hp and 250 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the car's spacious interior and straightforward controls. Common dislikes included somewhat dated styling and handling that wasn't as sporty as some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.4L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The first step is to monitor oil levels regularly and use the recommended oil type and viscosity. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the cause. In some cases, replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6**

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, clunking noises when accelerating or decelerating, and visible cracks or tears in the engine mounts.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed engine mounts. It's often recommended to replace all engine mounts at the same time for even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, or difficulty engaging certain gears.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change may resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal component failure may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Worn strut mounts can also affect handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn strut mounts. It's often recommended to replace the struts and shocks at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard (battery light), difficulty starting the engine, or a dead battery.
    *   Solution: Test the alternator's output voltage. If it's below the specified range, replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window will not roll up or down, or moves slowly and erratically. A clicking sound may be heard from the door panel.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust appearing on the body panels, especially around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Address rust as soon as possible to prevent further damage. Options include sanding and repainting affected areas, or replacing rusted panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning not blowing cold air. Clicking sound from the compressor when the AC is turned on.
    *   Solution: Replace the AC compressor, dryer, and expansion valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Mitsubishi Galant presents a mix of potential issues. The most concerning are the engine issues, particularly excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L engine, which can be costly to repair. The transmission and suspension issues are less severe but still warrant attention. Rust can be a significant problem depending on the vehicle's location and maintenance history. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making a thorough inspection essential before purchasing.
