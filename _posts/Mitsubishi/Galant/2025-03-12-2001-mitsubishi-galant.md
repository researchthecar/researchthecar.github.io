The 2001 Mitsubishi Galant was a mid-size sedan offering a mix of practicality and value. Engine options included a 2.4L 4G64 inline-four engine producing around 140 horsepower and 147 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L 6G72 V6 engine producing around 195 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic on both engines and a 5-speed manual on the 4-cylinder. Many owners appreciated its comfortable ride and spacious interior, while some common complaints revolved around reliability issues and the somewhat dated styling.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4G64 Inline-Four**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often develop from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the location of the leak and whether you're doing it yourself.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic idle, stalling, or difficulty starting.
    * Solution: Clean or replace the IAC valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L 6G72 V6**

* **Timing Belt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 6G72 is an interference engine, meaning that a broken timing belt can cause catastrophic engine damage (bent valves, damaged pistons). Symptoms include a sudden loss of power and the engine not starting.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing belt at the recommended interval of 60,000 miles is crucial. If the belt breaks, the engine needs to be disassembled to assess and repair the damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4-cylinder, oil leaks are common from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the location of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Flare**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or a brief increase in engine RPMs between shifts, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear.
    * Solution: A transmission flush and filter change may help in mild cases. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (flush) - $2000+ (rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jarring shifts, especially when cold.
    * Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be inspected and potentially rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (flush) - $800+ (valve body repair/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and decreased handling performance.
    * Solution: Replace the worn struts and/or shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per axle, depending on the brand and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Broken or Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, particularly over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace the worn bushings. Common areas include control arm bushings and sway bar bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per bushing replacement, depending on the location and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to go up or down, or moving very slowly.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP) or Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Stalling, rough running, or difficulty starting.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation in areas exposed to moisture and road salt, particularly around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    * Solution: Rust repair is necessary to prevent further damage. This can range from sanding and painting small areas to replacing entire body panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacement or repair of the dashboard. Dash covers can be used as a temporary solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (dash cover) - $800+ (dashboard replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Mitsubishi Galant is prone to a mix of engine, transmission, suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior issues. Engine issues include oil leaks and timing belt failure on the V6. Transmission problems center on shift quality. Suspension issues involve worn components. Electrical problems include power window failure. Rust is the main exterior concern, while the interior may suffer from cracking. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely, with some issues being relatively inexpensive to address, while others can lead to substantial repair bills.
