The 2003 Mitsubishi Galant was a mid-size sedan offered with two engine options: a 2.4L 4G64 inline-four producing 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L 6G75 V6 producing 230 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Galant for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, but criticized it for its lackluster fuel economy and some reliability issues.
