The 2002 Mitsubishi Galant is a mid-size sedan offering a blend of comfort and reliability. Available engines included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 140 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 outputting 195 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Galant's comfortable ride and spacious interior, but some dislike the bland styling and dated features.

**Summary**

The 2002 Mitsubishi Galant, while generally reliable, does have some common issues owners may encounter. Engine problems range from relatively minor leaks to more significant timing belt concerns, particularly for the V6 engine. Transmission issues, like shift solenoid or torque converter failures, can affect both engine variants. Suspension components, especially strut mounts and control arm bushings, can wear down over time, leading to ride quality and handling problems. Electrical issues such as power window motor and alternator failures are also common. Finally, dashboard cracking is a common interior complaint. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can help maintain the Galant's reliability and longevity.
