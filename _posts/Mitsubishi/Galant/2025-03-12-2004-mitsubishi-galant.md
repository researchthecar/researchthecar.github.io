The 2004 Mitsubishi Galant was a mid-size sedan offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 generating 230 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Galant for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively affordable price point. However, common complaints include issues with reliability, build quality, and the somewhat dated design compared to its competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and crankshaft seals. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the location of the leak.

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail, triggering the check engine light (specifically codes related to catalytic converter efficiency). This can result in reduced engine performance and potentially failing emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**3.8L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L, the 3.8L V6 can also experience oil leaks from various gaskets and seals.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the location of the leak.

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged or malfunction, leading to rough idling, stalling, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can exhibit harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to engage gears. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush, valve body repair or replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) to $2500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Can cause vehicle shuddering or vibration, especially during acceleration, as well as poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common wear items like struts, shocks, ball joints, and bushings can wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component depending on the extent of the damage.

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator may fail, leading to a dead battery, dimming headlights, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate.
    * Solution: Replace the window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$350+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can be an issue, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt. Common areas for rust include the wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the severity.

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may experience issues such as refrigerant leaks, compressor failure, or blower motor problems, resulting in weak or no cold air.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace faulty A/C components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the component.

*   **Broken or Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can become brittle and crack over time due to sun exposure.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Recalls:**
*   **Recall Number: 05V391000** - NHTSA Campaign Number: 05V391000. Defect: Vehicle Speed Control. Summary: On certain vehicles, the cruise control cable was improperly manufactured and installed on the throttle body. This could cause the engine throttle to stick in the open position, resulting in a loss of speed control.

*   **Recall Number: 07V208000** - NHTSA Campaign Number: 07V208000. Defect: Structure: Body: Door. Summary: On certain vehicles, due to improper door latch lever heat treating, the door latch lever could fracture resulting in the door opening while the vehicle is in motion and increase the risk of a crash.

**Summary**

The 2004 Mitsubishi Galant, while offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior, is prone to a variety of mechanical and electrical issues, with engine and transmission problems being particularly common. Oil leaks, catalytic converter failures, harsh shifting, and worn suspension components are frequently reported. The cost of repairs can range from relatively minor expenses for gasket replacements to significant investments for transmission or engine overhauls. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and address any existing issues before purchasing to mitigate the risk of costly repairs.
