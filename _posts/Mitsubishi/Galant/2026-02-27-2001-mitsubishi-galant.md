### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mitsubishi Galant, while offering a comfortable ride, presents several potential reliability concerns, particularly with its engine and transmission options. The 2.4L engine is prone to timing belt issues and oil leaks, while the 3.0L V6 can suffer from more serious head gasket problems. Automatic transmissions may develop slipping issues or torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also common wear items that can lead to handling issues. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module, can cause frustrating intermittent problems. Exterior rust, particularly in wheel arches, and interior HVAC blower motor failures are also noted. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor potential repair costs into their ownership budget.
