The 2005 Mitsubishi Galant is a mid-size sedan that offered a comfortable ride and decent handling for its time. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing around 160 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 generating approximately 230 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were generally reliable, however, some issues have surfaced over time. Owners often appreciate the Galant's spacious interior and simple design. Downsides frequently mentioned are the somewhat bland styling and average fuel economy. All trims came standard with an automatic transmission.
