**Introduction:**
The 2010 Mitsubishi Galant is a midsize sedan that offers a refined ride and a spacious interior. It is available with a choice of two engines: a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 160 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8-liter V6 engine with 230 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The Galant is praised for its comfortable seats, quiet cabin, and solid handling, but some drivers find it lacking in power and fuel efficiency.
