### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mitsubishi Galant presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly with the automatic transmission experiencing slipping or overheating, and potential oil leaks from the engine. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear out, leading to steering and noise issues. Electrical problems, especially related to the Body Control Module, can cause various intermittent malfunctions. Exterior rust, particularly in common areas, and interior components like HVAC blower motors and power window regulators are also noted areas of concern. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and consider a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
