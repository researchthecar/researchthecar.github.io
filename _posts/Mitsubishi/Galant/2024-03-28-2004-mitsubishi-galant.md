**Introduction:**

The 2004 Mitsubishi Galant is a midsize sedan that was offered with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 2.4-liter inline-4 that produced 145 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque. A 3.0-liter V6 was also available, producing 230 horsepower and 206 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual for the 2.4-liter engine, and a 5-speed automatic for the 3.0-liter engine.

The Galant was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and sporty handling. However, it was criticized for its lack of power, poor fuel economy, and cheap-feeling interior.
