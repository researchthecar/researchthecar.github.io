### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mitsubishi Galant presents a mixed reliability profile. While the 6-speed automatic transmission is generally robust, the 4-speed automatic has seen reports of harsh shifting and torque converter issues. Engine-wise, both the 2.4L and 3.8L engines can experience oil leaks and, in the case of the 2.4L, timing belt concerns. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Body Control Module and alternators, are not uncommon. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Exterior paint and interior HVAC components also have documented problems. Overall, while not a complete disaster, potential owners should budget for potential repairs beyond standard maintenance, especially concerning the transmission and electrical systems.
