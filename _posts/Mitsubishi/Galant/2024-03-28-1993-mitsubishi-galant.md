The 1993 Mitsubishi Galant is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable and reliable driving experience. It comes with a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 2.0L inline-four with 132 horsepower and 143 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 with 164 horsepower and 189 lb-ft of torque. While the Galant is generally well-received, it does have some common issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-Four**

* **Oil leaks:** Leaks can occur from the valve cover gasket, timing cover gasket, or oil pan gasket. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle or low oil levels. Solution: Replace the leaking gasket. Cost: $200 - $500+
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The gasket between the intake manifold and cylinder head can fail, leading to vacuum leaks. Symptoms include rough idling, poor acceleration, and increased emissions. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Cost: $300 - $600+
* **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt can break or slip, causing catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a sudden loss of power or a grinding noise from the engine. Solution: Replace the timing belt and related components. Cost: $600 - $1,000+

**3.0L V6**

* **Head gasket failure:** The head gasket can fail, allowing coolant to leak into the engine oil or exhaust. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, overheating, or a milky appearance in the oil. Solution: Replace the head gasket. Cost: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shifting problems:** The transmission may slip, hesitate, or refuse to shift gears. Symptoms include hard or delayed shifts, or a lack of response when shifting. Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission. Cost: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing a loss of power or transmission overheating. Symptoms include shuddering or vibration during acceleration, or a lack of acceleration. Solution: Replace the torque converter. Cost: $800 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** The front struts can wear out, leading to a rough ride or poor handling. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, nose-diving during braking, or a loss of steering control. Solution: Replace the struts. Cost: $400 - $800+
* **Ball joint failure:** The ball joints in the suspension can wear out, causing a clunking or popping noise when turning or going over bumps. Solution: Replace the ball joints. Cost: $200 - $400+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to discharge and the vehicle to lose power. Symptoms include dim lights, a dead battery, or a warning light on the dashboard. Solution: Replace the alternator. Cost: $300 - $600+
* **Starter failure:** The starter can fail, preventing the engine from starting. Symptoms include a clicking noise when trying to start the vehicle, or a complete lack of response. Solution: Replace the starter. Cost: $200 - $500+

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The Galant is prone to rust on the body panels, especially around the wheel arches and undercarriage. Symptoms include bubbling or peeling paint, or visible rust spots. Solution: Rust repair or replacement of affected panels. Cost: Varies depending on the severity of the rust.

**Interior**

* **Climate control issues:** The climate control system may fail to regulate temperature or airflow. Symptoms include inconsistent temperatures, lack of air flow, or a malfunctioning fan. Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty component. Cost: Varies depending on the issue.
* **Door lock failure:** The door locks may fail to open or close properly. Symptoms include difficulty locking or unlocking the doors, or doors that open or close spontaneously. Solution: Replace the door lock actuator or other faulty components. Cost: $100 - $300+

**Summary**

The 1993 Mitsubishi Galant has several common issues that owners should be aware of. These issues can range in severity from minor inconveniences to potentially catastrophic engine damage.
