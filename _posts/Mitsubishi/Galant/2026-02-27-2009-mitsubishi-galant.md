### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mitsubishi Galant is a moderately reliable vehicle. The most common concerns revolve around the 2.4L engine's oil consumption and potential timing belt issues, as well as some automatic transmission problems, particularly with the 4-speed unit. Electrical components like window regulators and alternators can also be points of failure. While the V6 engine and the 5-speed automatic transmission appear more robust, proactive maintenance, especially monitoring oil levels and adhering to the timing belt service schedule, is crucial for owners. Overall, it's a decent option if well-maintained, but be prepared for potential repairs related to the noted issues.
