The 2010 Mitsubishi Galant is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride and decent fuel economy. It came standard with a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 160 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some models were equipped with a 3.8L V6 engine, producing 230 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. The V6 was mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission as well.
