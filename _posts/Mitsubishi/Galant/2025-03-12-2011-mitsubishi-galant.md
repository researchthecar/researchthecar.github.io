The 2011 Mitsubishi Galant is a mid-size sedan known for its spacious interior and relatively affordable price point. It came standard with a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 160 horsepower and 157 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Galant's comfortable ride and simple design, while others criticize its outdated technology, fuel economy, and overall performance compared to its competitors. Common dislikes include the lack of modern features and the somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the need to add oil more frequently than expected, blue smoke from the exhaust (especially upon startup), and potentially fouled spark plugs.
    * Solution: Depending on the severity, possible solutions range from using a higher viscosity oil to replacing piston rings or even the entire engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (for higher viscosity oil) - $3,000+ (for engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter can fail prematurely, leading to poor emissions, reduced fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**
* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or jerky shifting between gears.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might improve the shifting. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal damage could require a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2,500+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride comfort, increased body roll during turns, and longer stopping distances.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000 (parts and labor for all four)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Broken or Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn or broken suspension bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on which bushings need replacing and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate properly, either intermittently or completely.
    * Solution: Replacing the window motor, regulator, or switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per window
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Radio/Audio System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the radio or audio system. This may involve no sound, inability to change stations, or a completely dead unit.
    * Solution: Replacing the head unit or repairing wiring connections.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Rear Quarter Panels**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the rear quarter panels, especially around the wheel wells.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mitsubishi Galant presents a mix of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption and catalytic converter failure, can be costly to address. Transmission issues like harsh shifting may be mitigated with maintenance, but serious problems require expensive repairs or replacement. Suspension wear is typical for a vehicle of this age, and electrical and interior issues are relatively common. Overall, the Galant can be an affordable option, but potential owners should be aware of these potential issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs spanning from a few dollars to thousands. A thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
