### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mitsubishi Galant presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's timing belt and oil seals, particularly with the 2.4L engine. Automatic transmission problems like slipping and harsh shifting are also noted. Suspension components, such as ball joints and bushings, can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, can cause various system malfunctions. Exterior rust, especially in common areas, and interior wear are also points to consider. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and ensure proper maintenance history.
