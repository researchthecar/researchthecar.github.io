- **Cost:** $800 - $1500

**Timing Belt Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Sudden engine stoppage, rough running, or complete engine failure if the belt breaks.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the timing belt, tensioner, and idler pulleys. It's recommended to replace the water pump at the same time.
- **Cost:** $500 - $900


### 3.8L 6G75 (SOHC V6)
**Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Vacuum leaks, rough idle, check engine light, and potential coolant leaks.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700

**Spark Plug Blowout**
- **Symptoms:** Misfires, rough idle, and a distinct popping sound from the engine bay.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of the spark plug threads in the cylinder head. Use of anti-seize on new plugs is recommended.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic (F4A51)
**Slipping Gears**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, difficulty shifting, or loss of power during acceleration.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change. If the problem persists, internal transmission repair or rebuild may be required.
- **Cost:** $200 - $3500+

**Torque Converter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering, slipping, or strange noises during acceleration or at idle.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the torque converter.
- **Cost:** $700 - $1200


### 5-Speed Manual
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, or a burning smell.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the clutch kit (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $600 - $1000


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering feel, and uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Strut Mount Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noises when turning, especially at low speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the strut mounts.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Malfunctioning power windows, door locks, interior lights, or dashboard warning lights.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


### Alternator
**Premature Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light, and eventual battery drain.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Exterior

### Body Panels
**Clear Coat Peeling**
- **Symptoms:** Fading paint, peeling clear coat, especially on the roof and hood.
- **Solution:** Repainting affected areas.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2000+


### Headlights
**Cloudy Lenses**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced visibility at night, yellowed or hazy headlight lenses.
- **Solution:** Headlight restoration kit or replacement of headlight assemblies.
- **Cost:** $100 - $400


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blower Motor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** No air coming from vents or intermittent fan speed.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blower motor or blower motor resistor.
- **Cost:** $200 - $500


### Dashboard
**Cracking Dashboard**
- **Symptoms:** Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, particularly in hot climates.
- **Solution:** Dashboard replacement or repair (cosmetic).
- **Cost:** $500 - $1500

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mitsubishi Galant presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.4L engine is generally robust but can suffer from oil consumption and timing belt issues. The V6 engine is more prone to intake manifold leaks and spark plug problems. Automatic transmissions can develop slipping issues, while manual clutches are subject to normal wear. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and premature alternator failure are also noted. Exterior paint can degrade, and interior components like the blower motor and dashboard may require attention. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential issues and budget for maintenance and repairs.
