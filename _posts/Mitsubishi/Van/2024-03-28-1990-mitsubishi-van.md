**Introduction:**

The 1990 Mitsubishi Van was a popular choice for families and businesses alike, offering ample space and versatility. It was available with two engine options: a 2.6L V6 and a 3.0L V6, paired with a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. Despite its popularity, the Mitsubishi Van has been known to encounter several issues over the years.

**Engine**

**2.6L V6**

* **Cylinder Head Gasket Failure:** Premature failure of the cylinder head gasket can lead to coolant leaks, overheating, and engine damage. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, decreased coolant levels, and engine misfires. Repairs typically involve replacing the cylinder head gasket and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $1,500+
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can allow coolant or oil to leak, resulting in overheating, engine damage, and poor performance. Symptoms include coolant or oil leaks, rough idling, and reduced engine power. Repairs involve replacing the intake manifold gasket and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800

**3.0L V6**

* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt is a critical component that synchronizes the operation of the engine. Failure can lead to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a sudden loss of power, rattling or grinding noises from the engine, and difficulty starting. Repairs involve replacing the timing belt, tensioner, and any damaged components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** A faulty valve cover gasket can allow oil to leak, resulting in oil consumption, decreased engine performance, and engine damage. Symptoms include oil leaks, smoke from the engine, and rough idling. Repairs involve replacing the valve cover gasket and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** A faulty shift solenoid can cause erratic shifting, delayed shifts, or difficulty shifting gears. Symptoms include harsh or delayed shifts, slipping gears, and transmission overheating. Repairs involve replacing the shift solenoid(s) and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Torque Converter Failure:** A faulty torque converter can lead to slipping, vibration, and overheating. Symptoms include loss of power, excessive fuel consumption, and transmission shuddering. Repairs typically involve replacing the torque converter and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $1,800+

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Failure:** A worn or damaged clutch can cause slipping, difficulty shifting gears, and premature wear of other transmission components. Symptoms include difficulty engaging gears, slipping during acceleration, and burning smell. Repairs involve replacing the clutch, pressure plate, and release bearing. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700+
* **Synchro Ring Failure:** Faulty synchro rings can lead to difficult or grinding gearshifts. Symptoms include crunchy or grinding noises when shifting, especially when the transmission is cold. Repairs involve replacing the synchro ring(s) and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure:** Worn or damaged struts or shock absorbers can compromise ride quality, handling, and braking performance. Symptoms include excessive bounce, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Repairs involve replacing the struts or shock absorbers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Ball Joint Failure:** Faulty ball joints can lead to loose or unstable steering, premature tire wear, and suspension damage. Symptoms include clunking or popping noises when turning, uneven tire wear, and excessive play in the steering wheel. Repairs involve replacing the ball joint(s) and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Failure:** The battery is a crucial component for starting the vehicle and powering electrical systems. Failure can lead to difficulty starting, electrical malfunctions, and loss of power. Symptoms include difficulty or inability to start the vehicle, dim or flickering lights, and electrical system malfunctions. Repairs involve replacing the battery and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator is responsible for charging the battery and powering electrical systems while driving. Failure can lead to battery drain, difficulty starting the vehicle, and electrical malfunctions. Symptoms include dim or flickering lights, battery discharge, and electrical system malfunctions. Repairs involve replacing the alternator and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The 1990 Mitsubishi Van is prone to rusting in areas such as the fenders, rocker panels, and body seams. Rust can compromise the structural integrity and appearance of the vehicle. Symptoms include visible rust spots, holes or cracks in the bodywork, and increased noise from the outside. Repairs involve removing the rust, repairing or replacing affected components, and applying protective coatings. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on severity

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Faulty climate control components can affect heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) performance. Symptoms include erratic temperature control, inability to adjust airflow, and poor air conditioning. Repairs involve diagnosing and replacing the faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
* **Instrument Cluster Failure:** Malfunctioning instrument clusters can result in incorrect or inconsistent readings for gauges such as the speedometer, tachometer, and fuel level. Symptoms include inaccurate instrument readings, flickering gauges, and complete failure of the instrument panel. Repairs involve replacing the instrument cluster or repairing the faulty components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Summary**

The 1990 Mitsubishi Van has several potential issues, some of which can be severe and costly to repair. Engine and transmission problems are among the most common and expensive. While the van offers space and versatility, these issues can significantly impact its reliability and longevity.
