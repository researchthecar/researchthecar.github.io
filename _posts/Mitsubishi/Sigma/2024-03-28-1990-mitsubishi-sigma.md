**Introduction:**

The 1990 Mitsubishi Sigma was a mid-size Japanese sedan. It was offered with two engine options: a 2.0-liter inline-four (6G72) and a 3.0-liter V6 (6G72). Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Sigma was known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and relatively sporty handling. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, particularly with the 2.0-liter engine.
