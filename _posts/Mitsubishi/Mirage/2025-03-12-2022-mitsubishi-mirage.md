The 2022 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact hatchback known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It comes equipped with a 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine producing 76 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Mirage is appreciated for its low price and excellent gas mileage, but criticized for its lackluster performance, basic interior, and limited cargo space.

**Engine**

**1.2L 3-Cylinder Engine**
*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing engine misfires, leading to rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating. The cause can be due to worn or fouled spark plugs, faulty ignition coils, or issues with fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the spark plugs and ignition coils and cleaning or replacing the fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Excessive Engine Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported louder than usual engine noise, especially at higher RPMs. This could be attributed to the engine's small displacement and the strain it experiences during acceleration.
    *   Solution: There may not be a permanent solution for this issue. However, using high-quality engine oil and ensuring proper lubrication can help minimize the noise. A mechanic should be consulted to determine if there are any underlying issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ depending on diagnosis and repair needs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This is a common characteristic of CVTs. However, in some cases, it can be a sign of a more serious issue such as worn transmission components or internal failure.
    *   Solution: Performing a CVT fluid flush and inspection could resolve the issue. In more severe cases, the CVT may require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4,000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mirage's suspension can feel harsh and unstable, particularly on rough roads. This is due to its simple suspension design and light weight.
    *   Solution: There is no real fix for this. Upgrading to aftermarket shocks and struts may improve the ride quality somewhat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the parts installed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing glitches with the infotainment system, including freezing, slow response times, or Bluetooth connectivity issues.
