# 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage

### Overview
The 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. As a budget-friendly option, its engineering prioritizes cost-effectiveness over premium features or high-performance capabilities. This focus can sometimes translate to a less robust build quality compared to more expensive vehicles. Reliability data for the Mirage generally indicates a mixed bag, with some areas performing well and others showing potential for concern, particularly as the vehicle ages or accumulates mileage. Owners often report satisfaction with its basic functionality and low running costs, but it's important to be aware of common issues that may arise.

### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage is a budget-friendly subcompact that generally performs its basic functions reliably. The 1.2L engine and manual transmission are typically trouble-free. However, the CVT transmission has been noted for potential issues like hesitation and overheating, requiring attention and potentially costly repairs. Electrical components, particularly the infotainment system, can experience glitches. Exterior paint and interior materials may show wear sooner than on more premium vehicles. While not plagued by major widespread mechanical failures, owners should be mindful of the CVT's behavior and potential for minor electrical and interior wear. Regular maintenance is key to maximizing the lifespan of this economical vehicle.
