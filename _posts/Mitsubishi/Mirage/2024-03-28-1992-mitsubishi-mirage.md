**Introduction:**

The 1992 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact car available with two engine options: a 1.3-liter I4 with 76 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5-liter I4 with 92 horsepower and 85 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed automatic transmission. The Mirage was praised for its fuel efficiency, reliability, and affordability, but criticized for its lack of power and interior space.
