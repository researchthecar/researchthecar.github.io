The 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It comes with a 1.2-liter 3-cylinder engine producing 78 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its low price and excellent fuel economy, while criticisms frequently focus on its limited power, basic interior, and somewhat noisy engine.

**Engine**

**1.2L 3-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, especially at idle. Noise or clunking sounds from the engine bay during acceleration or deceleration. Premature wear of other engine components due to increased vibration.
    *   Solution: Replace the engine mount(s). It's often recommended to replace all engine mounts at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on which mount(s) need replacement and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, loss of power, check engine light. Error codes indicating a specific cylinder misfire (e.g., P0301, P0302, P0303).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty ignition coil and replace it. It's recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time, especially if the car has high mileage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the cost of the ignition coil and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or high-pitched noise emanating from the transmission area, especially during acceleration. The noise may become louder over time.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change may temporarily alleviate the noise. However, the noise is often a sign of internal wear. In severe cases, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change: $100 - $200; CVT rebuild: $1500 - $3000+; CVT replacement: $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may experience jerking, hesitation, or a lack of smooth acceleration, especially at lower speeds. The CVT may feel like it's slipping or struggling to find the correct gear ratio.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change might help if the fluid is old or contaminated. If the problem persists, the CVT may have internal damage and need to be rebuilt or replaced. A software update or recalibration of the CVT control unit might also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change: $100 - $200; CVT rebuild: $1500 - $3000+; CVT replacement: $3000 - $5000+; Software update/recalibration: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during turns, nose diving during braking, uneven tire wear, leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts/shocks. It's recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) to maintain balanced handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the brand of struts/shocks and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for a few days. Difficulty starting the car, especially in cold weather. Dimming headlights or other electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system to rule out a bad battery or alternator. Check for parasitic drains (i.e., something that's drawing power from the battery when the car is off). Common culprits include aftermarket accessories (e.g., alarms, stereos) and faulty electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement: $100 - $300; Alternator replacement: $300 - $600+; Parasitic drain diagnosis and repair: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows that stop working, move slowly, or only work intermittently.
    *   Solution: Could be a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Bulb Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlight bulb burns out frequently.
    *   Solution: Replace the headlight bulb.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20-$100.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning blows warm air, doesn't cool effectively.
    *   Solution: Check refrigerant level and look for leaks. Compressor or other A/C component may be faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the issue and what parts are needed.)
    *   Recalls: None Found

In summary, the 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage, while affordable and fuel-efficient, can present owners with a range of issues. Engine mount and ignition coil failures are common engine-related concerns. The CVT transmission is prone to whining noises and jerking, potentially leading to costly repairs. Suspension issues like worn struts can affect ride quality. Electrical problems such as battery drain and power window malfunctions can also occur. While some issues are relatively minor, others, like CVT failure, can be quite expensive to fix. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
