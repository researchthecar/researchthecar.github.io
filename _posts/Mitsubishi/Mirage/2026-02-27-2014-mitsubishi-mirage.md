# 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage

### Overview
The 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact car designed for fuel efficiency and affordability. As a budget-oriented vehicle, its engineering prioritizes simplicity and cost-effectiveness over high-performance or luxury features. This often translates to a generally straightforward mechanical design, but can also mean that certain components may be less robust than those found in more premium vehicles. Reliability data for the Mirage generally indicates a mixed bag, with some areas performing well and others showing potential for concern, particularly as the vehicle ages. Owners often report satisfaction with its basic functionality and low running costs, but it's important to be aware of common issues that may arise.

### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage is a basic, economical subcompact. Its primary strengths lie in its fuel efficiency and low purchase price. Reliability is generally acceptable for its class, with the 1.0L and 1.2L engines and manual transmissions proving quite robust. The CVT, however, is a noted area of potential concern, with some owners experiencing hesitation or jerking, which can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues like battery drain and infotainment glitches are also occasionally reported. Exterior paint can be susceptible to fading. Overall, the Mirage is a functional car for budget-conscious buyers, but potential buyers should be aware of the CVT's reputation and factor in potential electrical maintenance.
