The 2001 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. Available engine options include a 1.5L 4G15 inline-four engine producing around 92 horsepower and 87 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the Mirage for its simple design and ease of maintenance, while others find its performance and features lacking compared to more modern vehicles. A common complaint is the overall lack of power. Transmission options consist of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic transmission.
