**Engine**

**1.2L 3-Cylinder Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from using a thicker oil, replacing valve stem seals, or replacing the piston rings. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3,000+

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can lead to rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. This can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors will resolve the issue. Diagnosis with an OBDII scanner is required to identify the affected cylinder.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

*   **CVT Jerking or Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerking, hesitation, or a lack of response during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change may alleviate the issue in some cases. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or high-pitched noise emanating from the transmission area, particularly during acceleration. This can indicate internal wear.
    *   Solution: Often requires replacement or rebuild of the CVT unit. Fluid changes may temporarily reduce the noise, but are not a permanent fix.

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of suspension components, such as struts, shocks, and bushings, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises, particularly over bumps.
