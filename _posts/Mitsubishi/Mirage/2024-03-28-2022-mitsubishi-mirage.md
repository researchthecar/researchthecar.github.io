**Introduction**

The 2022 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact hatchback that offers fuel-efficient performance and affordability. It comes with a single engine and transmission option: a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Mirage has received praise for its low operating costs and spacious interior for its size, but criticism for its underpowered engine and lack of advanced features.

**Engine**

* **1.2L Three-Cylinder**
    * **Excessive Carbon Buildup:**
        * Description/Symptoms: Thick carbon deposits accumulate on the intake valves, reducing airflow and causing rough idling, hesitation, and decreased performance.
        * Solution: Remove the intake manifold and clean the valves manually.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $400+
    * **Ignition Coil Failure:**
        * Description/Symptoms: One or more ignition coils fail, resulting in misfires, engine vibration, and potential damage to the catalytic converter.
        * Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coils.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300+ per coil

**Transmission**

* **Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)**
    * **Slipping or Hesitation:**
        * Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips or hesitates during acceleration, causing poor performance and increased fuel consumption.
        * Solution: Replace the CVT fluid and filter. In severe cases, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    * **Overheating:**
        * Description/Symptoms: The CVT overheats during prolonged driving, leading to reduced performance, a burning smell, and potential transmission damage.
        * Solution: Replace the CVT cooler or install an external cooler.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**
