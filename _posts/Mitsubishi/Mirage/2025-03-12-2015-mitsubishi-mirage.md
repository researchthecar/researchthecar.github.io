The 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It comes with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine producing 74 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Mirage's low price and excellent gas mileage, making it a budget-friendly option for commuting. However, common complaints include its lack of power, basic interior, and less refined driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage, while economical, has several common issues. The most serious and costly problems tend to revolve around the CVT transmission, which can experience premature failure. Engine issues, such as vibration and misfires, and suspension component wear are also frequently reported. Electrical problems, such as battery drain, also occur. While some issues can be addressed relatively inexpensively, the potential for a costly CVT replacement makes it crucial for prospective buyers to thoroughly inspect the transmission's condition and maintenance history.
