## 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage

The 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact hatchback that offers a fuel-efficient and affordable option for city driving. It comes with a single 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The Mirage is known for its low price, spacious interior, and good fuel economy. However, it has been criticized for its lack of power, poor handling, and cheap interior materials.

### Engine
- 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine (78 hp, 74 lb-ft torque)

### Transmission
- Continuously variable transmission (CVT)

**Engine**
- **Oil leaks:** Oil can leak from the valve cover gasket, causing a burning smell and potential engine damage.
- **Coolant leaks:** Coolant can leak from the radiator, causing overheating and potential engine damage.
- **Timing chain problems:** The timing chain can stretch or break, causing engine damage.

**Transmission**
- **CVT failure:** The CVT can fail prematurely, causing the vehicle to lose power.

**Suspension**
- **Weak shocks and struts:** The shocks and struts can wear out prematurely, causing a rough ride and poor handling.
- **Leaking struts:** The struts can leak oil, causing a loss of damping and reduced handling.

**Electrical**
- **Battery issues:** The battery can fail prematurely, causing starting problems.
- **Electrical shorts:** Electrical shorts can occur in the wiring harness, causing various electrical problems.
- **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to drain and the vehicle to lose power.

**Exterior**
- **Rust:** The body panels can rust prematurely, especially in areas near wheel wells and underbody.
- **Headlight condensation:** Condensation can build up inside the headlights, impairing visibility.

**Interior**
- **Cracked dashboard:** The dashboard can crack over time, especially in hot climates.
- **Broken door handles:** The door handles can break, making it difficult to open the doors.
- **Loose trim panels:** The trim panels can become loose, rattling and creating noise inside the cabin.

**Summary**

The 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage has a number of potential issues, including oil and coolant leaks, timing chain problems, CVT failure, weak suspension components, electrical shorts, alternator failure, rust, headlight condensation, cracked dashboard, broken door handles, and loose trim panels. While some of these issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be more serious and costly. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues vary depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
