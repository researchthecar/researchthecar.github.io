The 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage is a subcompact car known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It comes with a single engine option: a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine producing 76 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque. It is available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the Mirage's low price and excellent gas mileage, but some dislike its limited power and basic features.

**Engine**

**1.2L 3-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Engine Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report noticeable vibrations, especially at idle or low speeds. This can be felt through the steering wheel, seats, and pedals.
    *   Solution: Check engine mounts for wear or damage. Replacement might be necessary. Also, inspect spark plugs for proper condition and gap. A tune-up might alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the source of vibration and what parts are replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may idle unevenly, possibly stalling.
    *   Solution: A dirty throttle body can cause rough idling. Clean the throttle body and check for vacuum leaks. Also, check idle air control (IAC) valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **Hesitation During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed response when pressing the accelerator. The car may feel sluggish, especially when trying to accelerate quickly or merge onto highways.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid change, ensuring the correct Mitsubishi-specified fluid is used. Check for any software updates for the transmission control module (TCM) and consider a TCM reset.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shuddering/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission might exhibit shuddering or jerking sensations, particularly at low speeds or during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the CVT fluid. Inspect the CVT chain and pulleys for wear or damage. In severe cases, a transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for fluid change, $3,000+ for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, and other functions.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. Check for any available software updates for the infotainment system. If the problem persists, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for reset; $100 - $200+ for software update; $300 - $800+ for replacement.

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle battery may drain faster than normal, especially when left sitting for extended periods. This can result in difficulty starting the engine or a completely dead battery.
    * Solution: Inspect the battery terminals for corrosion and clean them thoroughly. Test the battery's overall health and replace it if necessary. Check for any parasitic drains by testing the current draw with the vehicle off and all accessories disabled. A parasitic drain is a small current draw that continues to drain the battery even when the vehicle is off. If a drain is found, isolate the circuit causing it and repair the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $10-$20 to clean terminals, $100-$300 to replace battery, $100+ to fix parasitic drain.
    * Recalls: None Found
