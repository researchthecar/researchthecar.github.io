    *   Solution: Replace spark plugs and/or ignition coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency, reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

*   **CVT Transmission Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or hesitant acceleration, especially at low speeds.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid flush and filter change might alleviate the problem, but in some cases, the CVT unit may need replacement.

**Summary**

The 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage, while fuel-efficient and affordable, can experience issues with its engine, CVT transmission, suspension, and electrical system. Engine misfires and catalytic converter problems are common, while the CVT can exhibit jerking and whining noises. Suspension components can wear prematurely, and electrical issues such as battery drain and blown fuses can occur. Repair costs vary depending on the specific issue, ranging from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing spark plugs or fuses to more costly repairs such as CVT replacement. While none of these are particularly severe issues, owners should be aware of these potential problems.
