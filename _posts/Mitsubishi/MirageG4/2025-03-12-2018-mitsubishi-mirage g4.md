The 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 is a subcompact sedan known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It comes equipped with a 1.2-liter inline-3 engine producing 78 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Mirage G4 for its low price and excellent gas mileage, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. However, common complaints include its underpowered engine, basic interior, and somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

**1.2L Inline-3 Engine**

*   **Excessive Engine Vibration/Shaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report excessive engine vibration, especially at idle or low speeds. This can manifest as shaking of the steering wheel, seats, and the entire vehicle. It might also be accompanied by unusual engine noises.
    *   Solution: The most common fix is replacing the engine mounts. A mechanic should also inspect the engine for other potential causes, such as a misfire or damaged spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature catalytic converter failure. Symptoms include a check engine light (often with code P0420), reduced engine performance, and a sulfur-like smell.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported instances of one or more coil packs failing. Symptoms can include a check engine light, misfiring, rough idling, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Shuddering/Hesitation During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced shuddering, hesitation, or a general lack of responsiveness from the CVT, particularly during acceleration from a stop or at low speeds.
    *   Solution: A fluid flush and CVT recalibration may temporarily alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, a CVT replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush and recalibration), $3000 - $5000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or high-pitched noise emanating from the transmission area, especially during acceleration. This noise often gets louder with increased vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: This could be a sign of internal CVT wear or damage. A full transmission inspection is necessary. In some cases, a fluid change can help reduce the noise but it's often a sign of a more serious issue. More serious cases may require transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $3000 - $5000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**
*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking or rattling noises, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This can affect handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per bushing/component replaced
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Weak Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have found that the factory shocks and struts wear out quickly, leading to a bouncy ride and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shocks and/or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failing Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the door lock actuators. This can cause the doors to not lock or unlock properly, either with the key fob or the interior controls.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported instances of the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle is left sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic draw and repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Headlight Bulbs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent burnout of the factory headlight bulbs.
    *   Solution: Replacement with higher-quality bulbs.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or non-functional air conditioning. Often related to a refrigerant leak or a failing compressor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the AC system, which may involve repairing leaks, replacing the compressor, or recharging the refrigerant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the radio or infotainment system, such as freezing, crashing, or failing to connect to Bluetooth.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4, while economical, has its share of potential issues. Engine vibrations, catalytic converter problems, and CVT issues are among the more serious concerns, with repair costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars for a CVT replacement. Suspension bushing wear and electrical problems like failing door lock actuators are also relatively common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. While not all Mirage G4s will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of them and carefully inspect any used vehicle before purchase. The issues can range from moderate inconvenience to costly repairs, so factoring in a potential maintenance budget is wise.
