**Engine**

**1.2L 3-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating and visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed. If consumption is excessive, a mechanic may need to perform a leak-down test to check for internal engine issues. In some cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ depending on the severity and required repair.
