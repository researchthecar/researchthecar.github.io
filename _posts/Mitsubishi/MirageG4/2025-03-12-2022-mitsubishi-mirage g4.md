**Engine**

**1.2L 3-Cylinder Engine**
* **Excessive Engine Vibration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported experiencing noticeable engine vibration, particularly at idle and low speeds. This vibration can be felt through the steering wheel, seats, and pedals, causing discomfort and concern about potential engine issues.
    * Solution: In some cases, the issue may be due to a loose engine mount, which can be tightened or replaced. Other possible causes include worn spark plugs, a dirty air filter, or issues with the fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hesitation Upon Acceleration**
    * Description/Symptoms: Drivers sometimes report a delay or hesitation when accelerating from a stop or when trying to pass other vehicles. This can make merging onto highways and navigating traffic challenging.
    * Solution: The issue may be caused by a malfunctioning mass airflow sensor, a faulty throttle position sensor, or issues with the fuel injection system. A diagnostic scan can help identify the root cause.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Shudder/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noticed a shuddering or jerking sensation, particularly at low speeds or during acceleration. This can feel like the transmission is slipping or struggling to find the correct gear ratio.
    * Solution: A CVT fluid change may resolve the issue, especially if the fluid is old or contaminated. In more severe cases, the CVT may require a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Delayed Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported that the CVT takes a long time to engage when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse. This delay can be frustrating and potentially dangerous in certain traffic situations.
    * Solution: This issue may be caused by low CVT fluid, a faulty valve body, or internal damage to the CVT. A diagnostic scan can help pinpoint the problem.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Noises (Clunking/Rattling)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported hearing clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps or rough roads. This can indicate worn or damaged suspension components.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace worn or damaged suspension components such as struts, shocks, sway bar links, or bushings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect audio, navigation, and other features.
