The 2004 Mitsubishi Space Star is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. Engine options included a range of gasoline engines. A common engine was the 1.3L gasoline engine which produced around 82 horsepower. Transmission options were typically a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated its spacious interior for its size and ease of parking, but some disliked its relatively basic features and somewhat unrefined driving experience compared to newer vehicles.

**Engine**

**1.3L Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: High oil consumption can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals could reduce oil consumption. In severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idling or Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine idles roughly or stalls unexpectedly. This could be more apparent when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the idle air control valve (IACV) or throttle body can address this. Also, check for vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed gear changes.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes help. If the problem persists, valve body issues or worn clutches may require more extensive repairs or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings in the front and rear suspension. This could include control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, or strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may fail to lock or unlock all doors simultaneously, or may not function at all.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and repairing or replacing the central locking control module or individual door lock actuators. Check wiring and fuses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially on the undercarriage, wheel arches, and door sills.
    *   Solution: Treating surface rust with rust converters and applying paint. For severe rust, cutting out affected areas and welding in new metal may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Mitsubishi Space Star has a few common issues. The most significant engine issue is excessive oil consumption, which can be expensive to address if it requires internal engine work. Transmission issues like erratic shifting can also be costly to fix. Suspension and electrical problems are fairly common and may require multiple repairs. Rust is a significant concern in areas with harsh winters or coastal climates. The severity and cost of repairs can vary depending on the extent of the problem, but owners should be prepared for potential maintenance expenses, particularly with an older vehicle.
