**Introduction:**
The 2004 Mitsubishi Space Star is a compact hatchback that offers a comfortable ride and spacious interior. It is available with a 1.3L and 1.6L gasoline engine, both paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. While the Space Star is generally reliable, it has been reported to experience certain issues, which are outlined below:

**Engine**

**1.3L 4-cylinder Engine**
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, leading to vacuum leaks. This can cause a decrease in engine power, rough idling, and increased fuel consumption. Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gasket is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to skip or break. This can lead to catastrophic engine damage. Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and timing chain is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**1.6L 4-cylinder Engine**
* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** The valve cover gasket can leak oil, leading to engine oil loss. This can cause smoke from the engine bay and low oil levels. Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gasket is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250+

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual Transmission**
* **Synchronizer Wear:** The synchronizers in the transmission can wear out, causing difficulty shifting into or out of gears. Solution: Overhaul or replacement of the transmission is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**4-speed Automatic Transmission**
* **Torque Converter Shudder:** The torque converter can develop a shuddering sensation during acceleration. Solution: Replacement of the torque converter is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** The transmission can develop leaks from the pan gasket or seals. This can lead to low transmission fluid levels and transmission damage. Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Suspension**
* **Strut Mount Bearing Failure:** The strut mount bearings can wear out, causing a clunking noise when driving over bumps or turning. Solution: Replacement of the strut mount bearings is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $250+

**Electrical**
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, leading to insufficient charging of the battery. This can cause the battery to drain and the vehicle to stall. Solution: Replacement of the alternator is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely, even when the vehicle is not in use. Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic drain is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+

**Exterior**
* **Door Lock Failure:** The door locks can fail to operate, making it difficult to enter or exit the vehicle. Solution: Replacement of the door lock actuators or switches is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

**Interior**
* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard can develop cracks over time. Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Summary:**
The 2004 Mitsubishi Space Star faces several potential issues, such as intake manifold gasket failure, timing chain tensioner failure, valve cover gasket leak, synchronizer wear, torque converter shudder, transmission fluid leaks, strut mount bearing failure, alternator failure, battery drain, door lock failure, and dashboard cracking. The severity of these issues varies, and the cost to fix them can range from minor to major.
