The 2003 Mitsubishi Space Star is a compact MPV that was available with a range of engine options. The base engine was a 1.3L inline-4 that produced around 82 horsepower and 88 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 1.6L inline-4, a 1.8L inline-4 GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection) engine and a 1.9L diesel. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Some owners liked the Space Star for its practicality, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. Common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly with the GDI engine, and the car's rather bland styling.

**Engine**

**1.3L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly, particularly at idle or when decelerating. This is often related to a dirty or faulty idle air control (IAC) valve or throttle body.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body and IAC valve can sometimes resolve the issue. If the IAC valve is faulty, it will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.8L Inline-4 GDI**

*   **Carbon Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GDI engine is prone to carbon buildup on the intake valves, leading to rough idling, misfires, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: A walnut blasting or chemical cleaning of the intake valves is required to remove the carbon buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Fuel Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than expected fuel consumption with the 1.8 GDI engine.
    *   Solution: Ensure proper maintenance of the engine, including regular oil changes, air filter replacement, and spark plug replacement. Check for any fuel leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears.
    *   Solution: Fluid replacement or valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. The ride may feel bouncy or unstable. Often caused by worn ball joints, tie rod ends, or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the components)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may fail to lock or unlock the doors properly, or may function intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check the fuses and wiring related to the central locking system. If the problem persists, the central locking module or door lock actuators may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Electric Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows that fail to go up or down, or do so very slowly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage and Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the undercarriage, particularly around the wheel arches, sills, and suspension mounting points.
    *   Solution: Rust removal, treatment, and repainting or panel replacement. Prevention measures include undercoating and regular washing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2003 Mitsubishi Space Star faces several common issues. The GDI engine is prone to carbon buildup, and various electrical faults can occur. Suspension wear is also a common problem, especially for older vehicles. The severity and cost to fix these issues varies greatly, but some problems, like the GDI engine's carbon buildup, can be relatively expensive to address. Rust issues are also a concern. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase.
