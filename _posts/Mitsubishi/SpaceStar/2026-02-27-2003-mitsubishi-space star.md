### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mitsubishi Space Star generally presents a reasonable reliability record, particularly with its petrol engines. The main areas of concern tend to be related to the diesel engine's turbocharger and injectors, and common wear items in the transmission and suspension, especially on higher mileage examples. Electrical issues like window regulators and central locking actuators are also noted. While not immune to problems, most issues are repairable and not indicative of systemic failure across the board. Regular maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly can help ensure continued serviceability.
