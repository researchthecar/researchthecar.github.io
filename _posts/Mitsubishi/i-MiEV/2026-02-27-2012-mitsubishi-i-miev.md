### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mitsubishi i-MiEV generally exhibits good reliability in its core electric powertrain components, with the electric motor and single-speed transmission being robust. However, as with many early EVs, the high-voltage battery pack is a significant concern for long-term ownership, with degradation and eventual replacement being a costly inevitability. Electrical issues, particularly with the onboard charger and the smaller 12V auxiliary battery, have also been noted. Beyond these electrical aspects, the i-MiEV is relatively free from widespread mechanical or structural problems, making it a dependable choice for city driving if the battery's condition and potential replacement cost are carefully considered.
