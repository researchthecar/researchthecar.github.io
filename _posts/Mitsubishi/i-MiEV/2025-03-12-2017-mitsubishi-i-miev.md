**Electric Motor**

**Synchronous Permanent Magnet Motor**

*   **Reduced Range/Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the battery capacity degrades, resulting in a shorter driving range than originally advertised. Drivers may notice a significant decrease in range, especially in colder temperatures.
    *   Solution: Battery replacement or reconditioning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery can drain prematurely, especially if the car is left unused for extended periods. This can prevent the car from starting or cause other electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the 12V battery; check for parasitic drain on the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Onboard Charger Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The onboard charger, responsible for converting AC power to DC power for charging the main battery, can fail. Symptoms include slow charging or the inability to charge at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the onboard charger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heating and air conditioning system may fail or blow only hot or cold air. This can be due to a faulty blend door actuator or other HVAC components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of faulty HVAC components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of suspension components such as bushings, ball joints, and struts can lead to noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2017 Mitsubishi i-MiEV has some common issues revolving around its battery degradation and the onboard charger. While these electric vehicle-specific issues can be costly to repair, other issues such as suspension wear and HVAC problems are less expensive.
