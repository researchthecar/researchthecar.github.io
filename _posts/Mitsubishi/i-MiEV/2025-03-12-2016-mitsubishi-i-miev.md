**Summary**

The 2016 Mitsubishi i-MiEV presents a mixed bag for owners. The most significant concern is the potential for electric motor failure, which carries a high repair cost. Battery degradation leading to reduced range is also a common issue, though expected in EVs, the cost of replacement or repair can be substantial. Other issues, such as suspension wear and electrical problems, are more typical for vehicles of this age but should be considered during inspection and maintenance. The severity of electric motor and battery issues make them high priority concerns, while other reported problems are less critical but can still impact overall ownership satisfaction.
