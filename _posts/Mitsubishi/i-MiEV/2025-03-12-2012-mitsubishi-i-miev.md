The 2012 Mitsubishi i-MiEV is a fully electric subcompact hatchback. It boasts a 49 kW (66 hp) electric motor producing 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a single-speed reduction gear transmission. Owners often appreciate its affordability and zero-emission driving, making it ideal for short commutes. However, its limited range, relatively slow charging speed, and basic interior are common criticisms.

**Battery/Electric Motor**

* **Reduced Battery Capacity Over Time**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gradual reduction in the battery's capacity, leading to a noticeable decrease in driving range. This is a natural occurrence in all electric vehicle batteries, but can be more pronounced in older i-MiEVs.
    * Solution: Battery reconditioning may offer some improvement, but ultimately battery replacement is the solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $10,000+ (for a new battery pack)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Management System (BMS) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Error messages related to the battery or charging system. The BMS may not accurately monitor battery health or manage charging properly.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific BMS fault and replace the faulty component or reprogram the BMS.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**HVAC**

* **Heater Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The electric heater fails to produce adequate heat, especially in cold weather.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty heater core, blower motor resistor, or related wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Charging Port Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty charging the vehicle. This can manifest as a failure to recognize the charging cable, slow charging, or intermittent charging. Could be an issue with the J1772 connector.
    * Solution: Inspect the charging port for damage and replace if necessary. Check the charging cable and charging system components for faults.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **12V Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 12V auxiliary battery frequently drains, leading to starting issues or electrical system malfunctions. This can be due to a parasitic draw or a failing 12V battery.
    * Solution: Test the 12V battery and replace if needed. Identify and eliminate any parasitic drains.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Moisture accumulates inside the headlight housings.
    * Solution: Remove the headlight assembly, dry out the moisture, and reseal the housing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2012 Mitsubishi i-MiEV, while offering an affordable entry point into electric vehicle ownership, is prone to several issues. The most significant concern revolves around battery degradation and BMS problems, which can lead to reduced range and costly repairs. Electrical issues, especially with the charging port and 12V battery, are also prevalent. While less critical, headlight condensation can be annoying. Overall, owning a used 2012 i-MiEV involves a moderate risk of needing potentially expensive repairs, particularly related to the battery.
