The 2010 Mitsubishi Endeavor is a mid-size SUV offered with a single engine option: a 3.8-liter V6 producing 225 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Endeavor for its comfortable ride and spacious interior, while common complaints include its relatively low fuel economy, dated styling, and a limited list of features compared to its competitors.
