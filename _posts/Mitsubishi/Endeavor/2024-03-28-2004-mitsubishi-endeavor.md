**Introduction:**

The 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor is a midsize SUV that offers a V6 engine and an optional all-wheel drive system. With 225 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, the 3.8L V6 provides adequate power for most driving situations. The Endeavor is praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available safety features. However, it has been criticized for its dated styling and lack of refinement. The Endeavor was discontinued after the 2011 model year.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

* **Oil Consumption:** Some vehicles experience excessive oil consumption, leading to engine damage if not addressed promptly. The issue is caused by worn piston rings or valve guides. Repair involves replacing the affected components. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt can break prematurely, causing catastrophic engine damage. Regular replacement of the belt and tensioner is crucial to prevent this issue. Estimated cost: $600 - $1,000
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can cause a vacuum leak, leading to rough idling, decreased power, and poor fuel economy. Replacing the gasket resolves the problem. Estimated cost: $300 - $600

**Transmission**

**Four-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** Some vehicles experience transmission slippage, especially during shifting. The issue can be caused by worn clutches or a faulty transmission control module. Repair involves replacing the affected components. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,500+
* **Torque Converter Shudder:** The torque converter may shudder while the vehicle is accelerating, indicating a problem with the converter or its lock-up mechanism. Replacing the torque converter usually resolves the problem. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,500+

**Suspension**

* **Strut Assembly Failure:** The front strut assemblies can fail prematurely, causing a knocking or clunking noise over bumps. Replacing the struts with upgraded units is recommended. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000 per strut
* **Lower Control Arm Bushings:** The lower control arm bushings can wear out over time, leading to excessive play in the suspension. Replacing the bushings restores proper alignment and handling. Estimated cost: $200 - $500 per side

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail, causing the battery to drain and the vehicle to lose power. Replacing the alternator resolves the issue. Estimated cost: $500 - $800
* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic drain on the battery can cause it to discharge prematurely, leaving the vehicle unable to start. Identifying and repairing the source of the drain is necessary. Estimated cost: $100 - $500+

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Corrosion:** The tailgate may experience premature rusting, especially along the bottom edge. Protective coatings or replacing the tailgate is necessary to prevent further damage. Estimated cost: $500 - $2,000+
* **Plastic Trim Fading:** The exterior plastic trim may fade or discolor over time, affecting the vehicle's appearance. Refinishing or replacing the trim can restore its original look. Estimated cost: $200 - $1,000+

**Interior**

* **Interior Panel Squeaks and Rattles:** Various interior panels, such as the dashboard or door panels, may squeak or rattle over bumps or rough roads. Tightening or replacing loose components usually resolves the issue. Estimated cost: $100 - $500+
* **HVAC System Malfunction:** The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system may experience malfunctions, such as inoperative controls or air conditioning failure. Repairing or replacing faulty components is necessary to restore functionality. Estimated cost: $200 - $1,000+

**Summary**

The 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor has some known issues that can affect its reliability and driving experience. While the engine and transmission are generally reliable, the timing belt failure is a concern that should be addressed promptly. The suspension and electrical systems can also develop problems, but their severity and frequency are not widespread. Interior issues are mostly minor annoyances, while exterior issues can range from cosmetic concerns to more serious corrosion problems. Overall, the Endeavor is a reasonably reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues before making a purchase decision.
