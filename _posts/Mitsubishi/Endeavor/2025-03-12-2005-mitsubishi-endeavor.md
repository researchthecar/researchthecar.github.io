The 2005 Mitsubishi Endeavor is a mid-size SUV that was offered with only one engine and transmission option: a 3.8L V6 engine producing 215 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Endeavor's comfortable ride and spacious interior. Common complaints include lackluster fuel economy and some reliability concerns.
