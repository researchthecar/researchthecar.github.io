**Introduction:**

The 2005 Mitsubishi Endeavor is a mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and off-road capabilities. It is powered by a standard 3.8-liter V6 engine paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, generating 215 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. An optional 3.5-liter MIVEC V6 engine produces 263 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, mated with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While the Endeavor received praise for its impressive performance and reliability, it has also encountered some common issues.

**Summary:**

The 2005 Mitsubishi Endeavor generally has good reliability, but it is not without its common issues. The more significant problems, such as oil leaks, transmission issues, and dashboard cracking, can be expensive to repair. However, many of the other issues are relatively minor and can be addressed at a reasonable cost. Regular maintenance and timely repairs should help to prevent major problems and extend the life of the vehicle.
