The 2007 Mitsubishi Endeavor is a mid-size SUV that was offered with a single engine option: a 3.8L V6 engine producing 225 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Endeavor for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Common criticisms include its fuel economy and somewhat dated design.

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag over time, especially when carrying heavy loads. This can lead to a reduced ride height and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear springs or shocks. Upgrading to heavier-duty components may be beneficial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Mitsubishi Endeavor has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly valve cover leaks and timing belt maintenance, need to be monitored. Transmission problems can range from minor shifting issues to more significant failures, and the suspension might require attention due to sagging or worn components. Electrical problems such as power window failures and alternator failures can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with some repairs being relatively inexpensive, while others can be costly. Thorough inspection and maintenance are recommended to address these concerns.
