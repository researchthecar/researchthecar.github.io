### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mitsubishi Endeavor, while offering a practical package, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for vehicles of its age and class. The 3.8L V6 engine can be prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and requires diligent adherence to its timing belt replacement schedule. The automatic transmission may experience slipping or hesitation issues, potentially requiring significant repair. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also noted for wear. Electrical issues, particularly with power windows and alternators, can arise. Exterior rust, especially in vulnerable areas, and interior HVAC blower motor resistor failures are also reported. Despite these points, many Endeavors have provided reliable service when properly maintained, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas for inspection and potential future repairs.
