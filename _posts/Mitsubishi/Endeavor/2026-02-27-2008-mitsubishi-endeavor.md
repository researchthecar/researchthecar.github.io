## Engine

### 3.8L V6
**Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Coolant leaks, engine overheating, sweet smell of coolant, white smoke from exhaust.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

**Timing Belt Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Sudden engine stoppage, loss of power, potential for severe internal engine damage if it breaks while running.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the timing belt, tensioner, and idler pulleys. In case of failure, potential engine rebuild or replacement.
- **Cost:** $600 - $1200 (preventative replacement)


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic (4G69)
**Transmission Slipping/Hesitation**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, slipping between gears, rough shifting, potential for complete failure.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
- **Cost:** $500 - $3000+


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, uneven tire wear, vague steering feel.
- **Solution:** Replacement of control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Malfunctioning power windows, door locks, interior lights, or dashboard warning lights that come on and off randomly.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


## Exterior

### Body Panels & Seals
**Rust on Wheel Arches and Rocker Panels**
- **Symptoms:** Visible rust formation, bubbling paint, potential for perforation.
- **Solution:** Rust treatment and repair, repainting.
- **Cost:** $200 - $700


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blend Door Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Inability to control temperature (stuck on hot or cold), air only coming from certain vents.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blend door actuator(s).
- **Cost:** $200 - $400

### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mitsubishi Endeavor presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.8L V6 engine, while generally robust, is susceptible to intake manifold gasket leaks and requires timely timing belt maintenance to avoid catastrophic failure. The automatic transmission can experience slipping issues, potentially requiring significant repair. Suspension components like control arm bushings are common wear items that can lead to noise and handling problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM, can cause frustrating intermittent issues. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior climate control issues, such as blend door actuator failure, are also reported. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical flaws, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs.
