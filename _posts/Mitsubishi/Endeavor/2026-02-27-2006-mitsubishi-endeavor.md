### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mitsubishi Endeavor presents a mixed reliability profile. The V6 engine, while generally robust, is prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and requires timely timing belt replacement to avoid catastrophic failure. The automatic transmission can experience slipping issues, potentially leading to costly repairs. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items that can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical issues, such as failing power window motors and alternators, are also reported. Exterior concerns are minor, mainly involving rear hatch struts. Interior electrical issues like the HVAC blower resistor are also noted. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical failures, owners should be aware of these potential maintenance and repair points and budget accordingly for upkeep.
