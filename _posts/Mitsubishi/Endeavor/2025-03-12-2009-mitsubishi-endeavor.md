**Summary**

The 2009 Mitsubishi Endeavor has some common issues, with engine maintenance and transmission problems being potentially the most expensive to address. Suspension and electrical issues are also fairly common. While many issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, neglecting maintenance can lead to more serious and costly repairs. Careful inspection and addressing issues promptly can help extend the life of the vehicle. The issues are generally not considered severe unless a major engine or transmission failure occurs, which can be costly.
