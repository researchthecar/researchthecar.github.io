The 2022 Mitsubishi Xpander is a popular compact MPV known for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency, and affordability. It typically comes equipped with a 1.5-liter 4A91 inline-four gasoline engine producing around 103-105 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque. This engine is usually paired with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate its practicality and comfortable ride, but some criticisms include the somewhat underpowered engine, especially when fully loaded, and the basic interior materials.

**Engine**

**1.5L 4A91 Inline-Four**

*   **Excessive Engine Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported louder than expected engine noise, especially during acceleration. It may be described as a rattling or knocking sound.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is recommended. This may involve checking valve clearances, timing components, and other engine internals. Adjustment of valve clearances or replacement of worn components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause and extent of repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Reduced Fuel Economy**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unexpected fuel consumption may result from a variety of issues, including dirty air filters, faulty oxygen sensors, defective spark plugs, leaking fuel injectors, or issues with the fuel pump.
    *   Solution: Begin by inspecting the air filter for dirt, as a clogged filter can make the engine work harder. Next, evaluate the spark plugs for signs of wear or fouling, and replace if necessary. Following this, consider assessing the oxygen sensors for proper functionality, as these play a critical role in managing the air-fuel mixture. If these steps do not resolve the issue, it may be necessary to inspect the fuel injectors for leaks and ensure they are properly atomizing fuel, as well as checking the fuel pump for consistent pressure and output.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Begin by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. Low or contaminated fluid can cause shifting problems. A fluid change might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a diagnostic scan can check for error codes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: After shifting into Drive or Reverse, there may be a noticeable delay before the transmission engages and the vehicle starts moving.
    *   Solution: This could be related to low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or a faulty valve body. A transmission service, including fluid and filter replacement, should be performed first. If the problem continues, further diagnostics are needed to identify potential internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $2,000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This may be more pronounced when the vehicle is loaded.
    * Solution: This issue can often be traced to worn sway bar bushings, loose shock absorbers, or failing rear suspension bushings. A thorough inspection of all rear suspension components is necessary. Replacing worn bushings or tightening loose hardware can resolve the noise.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or unexpectedly reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealership may address known bugs or glitches. In some cases, a complete system reset or replacement of the head unit might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Testing the battery and charging system is the first step. A parasitic draw test can identify if any component is draining power while the vehicle is off. Common causes include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Faulty Door Latch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sometimes the door latches will become sticky and not close correctly. It will sound like the door has closed, but the door will still be slightly ajar and the door light will remain on.
    *   Solution: Spray the door latches and door jam components with a lithium grease to lubricate the door mechanisms. If the problem persists, the door latches may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $15 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Weakness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In very hot climates, some owners have found the air conditioning system struggles to cool the cabin effectively, particularly in the rear seats.
    *   Solution: Ensure the air conditioning system is properly charged with refrigerant. Checking for leaks in the system is also recommended. Window tint can also help reduce heat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Mitsubishi Xpander is a generally reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with the engine noise, harsh shifting, suspension noise, infotainment system, and air conditioning performance. The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor annoyances and others requiring more substantial repairs. The cost to fix these issues can range from relatively inexpensive to potentially significant, depending on the specific problem and the extent of the repair. It's important to note that these are common issues reported by some owners, and not all 2022 Xpander vehicles will experience these problems.
