The 2019 Mitsubishi RVR, also known as the Outlander Sport in North America, is a compact crossover SUV that offers a blend of affordability and practicality. It primarily came with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing around 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. A 2.4-liter inline-4 engine producing around 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque was also available on higher trim levels. Both engines were typically paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the RVR's fuel efficiency, compact size for city driving, and extensive warranty coverage. However, common criticisms include the engine's lack of power, the CVT's droning sound, and the use of lower-quality interior materials.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling while driving, which causes the vehicle to lose power and possibly create an unsafe driving situation.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the engine's components to determine the root cause of the issue. Could be a faulty sensor, mass airflow issue, fuel injector issue, etc.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jutter/Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a shuddering or jerking sensation, particularly during low-speed acceleration. This may be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Performing a CVT fluid flush and software update may alleviate the symptoms. In some cases, CVT replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$600 for fluid flush and software update; $4,000+ for CVT replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Jerky Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or a jerky feeling during acceleration, especially when trying to pass or merge onto the highway. The CVT may struggle to find the appropriate gear ratio.
    *   Solution: Software update of the transmission control module (TCM) or replacement of the CVT in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for software update; $4,000+ for CVT replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the suspension bushings, particularly the front control arm bushings. Symptoms include clunking noises when driving over bumps and reduced handling precision.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn bushings or complete control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect the navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or software update. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.

**Summary**

The 2019 Mitsubishi RVR has a mix of minor and moderate issues. Engine problems, specifically excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L engine, and CVT transmission issues represent some of the more concerning and potentially costly repairs. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera, along with suspension bushing wear and interior component breakage, are also frequently reported problems. Overall, while the RVR is generally reliable, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for potential repairs. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more substantial repairs.
