**Introduction:**

The 2021 Mitsubishi RVR is a compact SUV that offers a combination of practicality and affordability. It comes with a 2.0L 4-cylinder engine paired with either a CVT or a 6-speed manual transmission. Drivers appreciate the RVR's reliable performance, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. However, it has received some criticism for its lackluster acceleration and unrefined ride quality.

**Engine**

**2.0L 4-Cylinder Engine**

* **Premature Timing Chain Failure:** Excessive wear on the timing chain can cause it to fail, resulting in engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise, reduced engine power, and check engine light illumination. The solution involves replacing the timing chain, guides, and tensioner. The estimated cost to fix is $2,000 - $3,500+.
* **Intake Valve Carbon Buildup:** Over time, carbon buildup can accumulate on the intake valves, restricting airflow and reducing engine performance. The solution involves cleaning the intake valves and the intake manifold. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $1,200+.

**Transmission**

**CVT Transmission**

* **Shuddering or Rough Shifting:** The CVT transmission may experience shuddering or rough shifting during acceleration or when under load. This can be caused by worn or damaged clutch packs. The solution involves replacing the affected clutch packs. The estimated cost to fix is $1,500 - $2,500+.
* **Overheating:** In severe cases, the CVT transmission may overheat and enter limp mode. This can be caused by a faulty transmission fluid cooler or a clogged transmission filter. The solution involves inspecting and replacing the affected components. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $1,500+.

**Suspension**

* **Weak Front Struts:** Some RVR models have experienced prematurely worn front struts, leading to poor handling, excessive body roll, and uneven tire wear. Replacing the front struts and associated components can resolve the issue. The estimated cost to fix is $800 - $1,500+.
* **Rear Suspension Noise:** A clunking or rattling noise from the rear suspension can be caused by worn or damaged rear control arms or end links. Replacing the affected components typically resolves the issue. The estimated cost to fix is $600 - $1,200+.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Some RVR models have experienced excessive battery drain, even when the vehicle is turned off. This can be caused by faulty door switches or malfunctioning vehicle systems. The solution involves identifying and repairing the source of the battery drain. The estimated cost to fix varies depending on the underlying cause.
* **Check Engine Light for O2 Sensor:** An illuminated check engine light may be accompanied by a diagnostic code indicating a faulty oxygen sensor. Replacing the affected sensor typically resolves the issue. The estimated cost to fix is $300 - $600+.

**Exterior**

* **Wind Noise Around Mirrors:** Some drivers have reported excessive wind noise around the side mirrors, especially at highway speeds. The solution may involve applying weatherstripping or adjusting the mirror position. The estimated cost to fix is minimal.

**Interior**

* **Infotainment System Lag:** The infotainment system on some RVR models has been criticized for its slow response times and occasional freezing. Software updates or replacement of the infotainment unit may resolve the issue. The estimated cost to fix is $0 - $1,000+ (if replacement is necessary).

**Summary**

The 2021 Mitsubishi RVR has received mixed reviews from owners. While it offers reliable performance and a spacious interior, it has also been plagued by a number of issues, particularly with the timing chain and CVT transmission. The severity of these issues can vary depending on the specific model and mileage. The cost of repairs can range from minor to substantial, depending on the issue and the extent of the damage.
