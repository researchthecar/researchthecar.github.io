The 2017 Mitsubishi RVR, also known as the ASX or Outlander Sport in some markets, is a compact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual (less common) or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Some owners appreciate its compact size for city driving and the available all-wheel-drive system for added traction. Common complaints include perceived lack of power from the engine and the sometimes-noisy operation of the CVT.

**Engine**

**2.0L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels frequently and consult a mechanic to check for potential leaks, worn valve stem seals, or piston ring issues. If piston rings are the issue, a complete engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for leak diagnosis; $1,500 - $5,000+ for engine repairs or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may hesitate or stall, especially during acceleration or at idle. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Check and clean the Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF), inspect the throttle body for carbon buildup, and ensure the fuel injectors are functioning correctly. A software update from the dealer may also resolve this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for MAF sensor cleaning or replacement; $100 - $300 for throttle body cleaning; $100 - $500 for injector cleaning or replacement; $0 - $150 for software update.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Juttering/Shaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience a noticeable juddering or shaking sensation, particularly at low speeds or during acceleration. This can be caused by wear or degradation of the CVT fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a CVT fluid flush and replacement using the specific fluid recommended by Mitsubishi. If the problem persists, the CVT valve body or the entire transmission may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for CVT fluid flush; $800 - $1,500+ for valve body replacement; $3,000 - $6,000+ for full transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining noise emanating from the transmission, particularly during acceleration. This can indicate internal wear within the CVT.
    *   Solution: Initially, ensure the CVT fluid level is correct and in good condition. If the noise persists, further diagnosis by a transmission specialist is needed, which may lead to a CVT rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for fluid check and top-up; $2,000 - $5,000+ for CVT rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rear sway bar links, bushings, and shock absorbers for wear or damage. Replace any worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per sway bar link; $50 - $150 per bushing; $100 - $400 per shock absorber (plus labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, often resulting in difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the battery drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator. Replace any faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for parasitic draw test; $100 - $300+ for alternator replacement; $50 - $200 for relay or wiring repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently, requiring a restart.
    *   Solution: Check for software updates for the infotainment system. If the problem persists, a system reset or replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $50 for software update; $200 - $800+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature rust development, particularly in areas prone to salt exposure (wheel wells, rocker panels).
    *   Solution: Address rust spots promptly with sanding, rust treatment, and repainting. Consider applying rustproofing treatments to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per rust spot depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or non-existent air conditioning, especially on hot days. This may be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a clogged condenser.
    *   Solution: Check the refrigerant level and look for leaks. Repair any leaks and recharge the system. If the compressor is faulty, it will need to be replaced. A clogged condenser should be cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 for refrigerant recharge and leak test; $400 - $1,000+ for compressor replacement; $200 - $500 for condenser cleaning or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2017 Mitsubishi RVR presents a range of potential issues, from engine oil consumption to CVT transmission problems and electrical glitches. While some issues like oil consumption and CVT juddering can be relatively costly to address, others, such as suspension noise or battery drain, might have more manageable repair costs. It is important to note that severity and repair expenses vary depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage. Prospective buyers should consider these potential maintenance requirements when evaluating the overall ownership cost of the vehicle.
