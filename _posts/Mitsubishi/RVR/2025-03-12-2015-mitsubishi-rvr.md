The 2015 Mitsubishi RVR, also known as the ASX or Outlander Sport in some markets, is a subcompact crossover SUV. For the North American market, it was primarily offered with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing around 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (less common) and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the RVR's fuel efficiency and compact size, making it suitable for city driving. Common complaints include lackluster acceleration, a noisy CVT, and a somewhat basic interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (4B11)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, a burning oil smell, and visible blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the valve stem seals or piston rings may resolve the issue. A compression test can help diagnose the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires and a rough idle can occur due to faulty ignition coils or spark plugs. Symptoms include shaking, reduced power, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils or spark plugs typically resolves the issue. Diagnosing the specific cylinder causing the misfire is important.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or buzzing noise coming from the transmission area, especially during acceleration. The noise may worsen over time.
    *   Solution: A fluid flush *may* alleviate the noise temporarily. More likely, the CVT may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or jerking during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. The transmission may feel sluggish or unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Start with a CVT fluid change using the correct Mitsubishi fluid. If the problem persists, the CVT valve body might be failing or the entire unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) to $3,000 - $5,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn sway bar bushings, end links, or struts.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components. Start with the sway bar bushings and end links, as they are typically the first to wear.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle sits for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: A parasitic draw test can help identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a malfunctioning infotainment system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, glitch, or become unresponsive. Issues can range from a blank screen to difficulty connecting to Bluetooth.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the system. If that doesn't work, a software update (if available) or replacement of the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing around the license plate lights and door handle on the rear hatch/liftgate.
    *   Solution: Repair and repaint the affected areas. Address any underlying causes, such as water leaks, to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in warmer climates where the dashboard is exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: The dashboard can be replaced or covered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200+ (for a dash cover) to $800 - $1,500+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Mitsubishi RVR has some known issues, with the most concerning being the CVT problems and excessive oil consumption. The CVT issues, while not universal, can be costly to repair. Electrical glitches and suspension noises are also worth noting. While not presenting a uniformly catastrophic ownership experience, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, especially performing a thorough pre-purchase inspection. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (e.g., ignition coil replacement) to potentially major (e.g., CVT failure), with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
