The 2016 Mitsubishi RVR, also known as the ASX or Outlander Sport in some markets, is a compact crossover SUV. The RVR came with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing around 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission (FWD only) or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciate the RVR's fuel efficiency, compact size, and affordability. Common dislikes include its underpowered engine and somewhat dated interior design.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating or discovering significantly reduced oil levels during routine checks.
    *   Solution: The specific cause of oil consumption varies, and may involve piston rings, valve seals, or PCV valve issues. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source. Depending on the diagnosis, the repair may involve replacing valve seals, piston rings, or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and the chosen repair option).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling can occur at idle or during low-speed maneuvers. This may be accompanied by a rough idle or hesitation.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking the mass airflow sensor (MAF), throttle body, and idle air control valve (if equipped). Cleaning or replacing the faulty component may be necessary. Additionally, check for vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **CVT Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced premature CVT failure, characterized by slipping, hesitation, jerking, or complete loss of drive. Warning lights may illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the CVT is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration, particularly from a standstill or at low speeds, is a common complaint. Some owners also report jerky or erratic shifting behavior.
    *   Solution: A software update may improve CVT performance. In some cases, a CVT fluid flush or replacement may help. If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and chosen repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of suspension components such as struts, shocks, and sway bar links can lead to a bumpy ride, poor handling, and excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn suspension components with new parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery may drain quickly, especially when left parked for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve testing various electrical components and circuits. Common causes include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator. Replacing the affected component or addressing the wiring issue can resolve the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, crash, or exhibit other malfunctions. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: A software update may resolve some infotainment system issues. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rust forming around the wheel wells, door edges, or other areas, especially in regions with harsh winters.
    *   Solution: Repairing and repainting the affected areas to prevent further corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Failing Door Lock Actuators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door locks may intermittently fail to lock or unlock, or may make unusual noises.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failing door lock actuator(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$400 per door.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Mitsubishi RVR has a mix of minor and potentially major issues. The most concerning is premature CVT failure, which can be expensive to repair. Excessive oil consumption and electrical issues are also prevalent. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can lead to substantial repair bills. Prospective buyers should have the vehicle thoroughly inspected, paying particular attention to the condition of the CVT and engine, before making a purchase.
