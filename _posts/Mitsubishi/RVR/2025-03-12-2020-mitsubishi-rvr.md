The 2020 Mitsubishi RVR is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It's powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate the RVR's compact size for city driving and its available all-wheel-drive system for added traction. However, common criticisms include its somewhat dated interior, underwhelming acceleration, and limited cargo space compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially engine knocking if oil levels get critically low.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and topping off as needed. In some cases, a dealer oil consumption test may be performed. If consumption is deemed excessive, engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a hesitation or jerking sensation, particularly during initial acceleration or when attempting to accelerate quickly. This can feel like the transmission is "searching" for the right gear ratio.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may improve the transmission's behavior. In some cases, replacing the CVT may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $4,000+ (for CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Rear Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of rear suspension components, such as the rear shocks or stabilizer bar bushings. This can lead to a clunking or rattling noise from the rear of the vehicle, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect the radio, navigation (if equipped), and other features controlled through the system.
    *   Solution: Checking for and installing any available software updates for the infotainment system. If the problem persists, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $500+ (for infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises from Dashboard/Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling noises emanating from the dashboard or other interior trim pieces, particularly when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing the loose trim pieces. This may involve adding foam padding or tightening screws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Mitsubishi RVR has some common issues that owners have been reporting. The most prevalent are issues with the engine and transmission. Excessive oil consumption can potentially lead to engine damage, while transmission hesitations affect drivability. Suspension and electrical issues are also present, but are less common. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but some issues can be relatively minor, while others, such as CVT failure or excessive oil consumption requiring engine work, can be expensive.
