The 2013 Mitsubishi RVR, also known as the ASX in some markets or Outlander Sport in North America, is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency and compact size. For the 2013 model year, it was primarily offered with a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing around 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciate the RVR's nimble handling and affordability, but often critique its somewhat underpowered engine and basic interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls intermittently, especially at low speeds or when idling.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor or throttle body. Inspecting the intake system for leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an unusually high amount of oil between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve stem seals or piston rings. In severe cases, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining sound coming from the transmission, especially during acceleration.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid change, inspection for wear. Replacing the CVT if the noise persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change), $3000 - $6000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission exhibits jerky movements or hesitates during acceleration or gear changes.
    *   Solution: Performing a CVT fluid flush, resetting the CVT learning parameters, or replacing the CVT valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush), $500 - $1500+ (valve body), $3000 - $6000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll during cornering, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn struts and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Noisy Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or creaking noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar links, control arm bushings, or ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dead Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure, difficulty starting the vehicle, especially in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Replacing the battery, checking the charging system for proper voltage output, and diagnosing parasitic draws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window motor, switch, or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues (specific regions)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the undercarriage, door panels, or around wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. Applying rustproofing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning blowing warm air, not cooling effectively, or making unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, condenser, or evaporator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Mitsubishi RVR can present owners with several issues. Engine issues, such as stalling and excessive oil consumption, can be costly to resolve. CVT transmission problems are also a concern, with whining noises and jerky operation being commonly reported. Suspension issues like worn struts and noisy components can affect ride quality. Electrical problems, such as dead batteries and power window failures, add to the list of potential headaches. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be more severe and require significant investment to repair, especially if a transmission replacement is needed. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used 2013 RVR before purchasing.
