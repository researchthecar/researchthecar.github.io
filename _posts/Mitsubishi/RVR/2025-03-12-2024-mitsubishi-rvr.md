The 2024 Mitsubishi RVR is a subcompact crossover known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. The sole engine option is a 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its maneuverability and standard features, but some find the engine underpowered and the interior materials basic.
