The 2021 Mitsubishi RVR is a subcompact crossover SUV known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability, making it a popular choice for city driving. The RVR comes standard with a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate the RVR's ease of parking and its standard safety features. However, common complaints include a lack of engine power, outdated interior styling, and a less refined driving experience compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil level warning light illuminating, and visible exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and perform oil consumption tests to determine the rate of consumption. Depending on the severity, solutions can range from using a higher viscosity oil to replacing piston rings or the entire engine in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (oil change) to $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerky Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced hesitation or jerky acceleration, especially when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. The CVT may feel sluggish or unresponsive at times.
    *   Solution: Check the CVT fluid level and condition. Perform a CVT fluid change using the specified Mitsubishi fluid. In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the CVT may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change), $3,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, which controls navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions, may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently.
    *   Solution: Try a soft reset of the system by holding the power button. Check for software updates and install them. If the problem persists, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Struts Failing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts that hold the rear hatch open may weaken prematurely, causing the hatch to fall or not stay open on its own.

    *   Solution: Ensure the phone's Bluetooth software is up-to-date and compatible. Delete and re-pair the phone with the infotainment system. A software update for the infotainment system may be required. If it continues, the bluetooth module may be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $200+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mitsubishi RVR exhibits a range of issues, from relatively minor infotainment glitches and Bluetooth connectivity problems to more concerning issues like CVT hesitation and, in some cases, excessive oil consumption. The severity and cost of these potential repairs vary widely, with some issues potentially resolvable through software updates or fluid changes, while others might require more substantial component replacements. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2021 RVR.
