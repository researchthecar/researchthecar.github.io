The 2012 Mitsubishi RVR, also known as the ASX or Outlander Sport in some markets, is a compact crossover SUV. In many markets, it was primarily offered with a 2.0-liter 4B11 inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners often appreciate the RVR's fuel efficiency and compact size, making it easy to maneuver in urban environments. Common complaints revolve around the engine's somewhat lackluster performance, especially when fully loaded, and the CVT's droning sound during acceleration.

**Engine**

**2.0L 4B11 Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Initially, closely monitor oil levels and usage. In some cases, switching to a higher viscosity oil may help. However, if consumption is excessive, a piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the valve cover onto the exhaust manifold, leading to a burning oil smell. Visible oil residue around the valve cover.
    * Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced jerking or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be more pronounced when the CVT is cold.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change, using the correct Mitsubishi CVT fluid, can sometimes alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement, or complete CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change $150 - $300, Valve Body $800-$1500, CVT Replacement $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Whining Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive whining noise from the CVT, especially during acceleration.
    * Solution: CVT fluid change. If the noise persists, inspection for internal damage to the CVT may be needed, potentially leading to a CVT replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change $150 - $300, CVT Replacement $3000 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the rear shock absorbers. Symptoms include a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive rear-end sway.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (for both)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Noisy Suspension**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar links, bushings, or ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ depending on the component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle experiences a rapid battery drain, especially when not driven for a few days. Can result in difficulty starting or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws. This may involve testing various circuits to identify the source of the drain. It could be a faulty relay, aftermarket accessory, or other electrical component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows. Often involves the window motor or switch.
    *   Solution: Test the window motor and switch. Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on body panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust development on the exterior body panels of the vehicle, especially in areas prone to salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Repair and repaint the affected areas. Apply rust protection measures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000+ per panel depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard (expensive). Dashboard covers or applying protectant can help mitigate further damage if the cracking is minor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or non-existent cold air from the air conditioning system.
    *   Solution: Recharge the AC system, inspect for leaks, and replace faulty components such as the compressor or condenser.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Mitsubishi RVR, while praised for its fuel efficiency and compact size, presents owners with several potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the CVT transmission, which can exhibit jerking, hesitation, and whining noises, potentially leading to costly repairs or replacements. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and valve cover gasket leaks are also notable. Electrical problems such as battery drain and power window failure, along with suspension issues, contribute to the overall ownership experience. While the severity and cost of these issues vary, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance expenses when considering this vehicle.
