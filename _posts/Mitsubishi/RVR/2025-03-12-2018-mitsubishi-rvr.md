*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, and in severe cases, engine knocking or damage due to insufficient lubrication.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and using the recommended oil type and viscosity. In some cases, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test to determine the severity. Possible repairs range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings or even a short block replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can occur, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. This can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with an OBD-II scanner to identify the affected cylinder(s). Replacing the faulty ignition coil, spark plug(s), or fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **CVT Jerking or Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced jerking or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be due to issues with the CVT's internal components or programming.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid flush may help in some cases. If the issue persists, it could require a CVT recalibration or, in more severe cases, a CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining noise coming from the transmission area, especially during acceleration. This can indicate excessive wear or damage within the CVT.
    *   Solution: A mechanic should diagnose the source of the whine. If the whine is due to damaged internal components within the transmission it may require complete transmission replacement.
