The 2014 Mitsubishi RVR, also known as the ASX or Outlander Sport in some markets, is a compact crossover SUV. In North America, it primarily came with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate its fuel efficiency and compact size, making it easy to maneuver in urban environments. Common complaints include lackluster acceleration and a somewhat noisy engine.
