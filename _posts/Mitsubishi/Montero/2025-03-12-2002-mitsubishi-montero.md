The 2002 Mitsubishi Montero is a capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and relatively comfortable ride for its class. The primary engine offered was a 3.5L V6 engine producing approximately 200 horsepower and 228 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its robust build and off-road capabilities, while common dislikes include its fuel economy and age-related maintenance needs.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil consumption, potential engine bay mess, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L V6 is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, the pistons will impact the valves causing major internal damage to the engine. Symptoms include engine misfires, ticking noises, inability to start, and complete engine failure if the belt snaps.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt and water pump according to the manufacturer's recommended service interval (typically every 60,000 miles). If the belt has already failed, extensive engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000 for preventative maintenance; $2000+ for engine repair/replacement if the belt fails.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission exhibits rough or delayed shifts, particularly when shifting between gears. Can also cause a clunking sound and difficulty accelerating
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the issue persists, a more in-depth inspection of the valve body and solenoids may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid/filter change; $500 - $1500+ for valve body/solenoid repair or replacement.

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, and/or illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+

Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Sagging Rear Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Leads to poor ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear coil springs and/or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per corner

Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+ per window

*   **Faulty Crankshaft Position Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, or running rough. Check engine light illumination.

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts. Can lead to structural weakness.
    *   Solution: Removal of rust, application of rust inhibitor, and undercoating. In severe cases, welding may be required to repair damaged sections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on severity

Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent or non-functional heating and air conditioning. Can be caused by a faulty blend door actuator, refrigerant leaks, or compressor issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the problem and repair or replace the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the issue

**Summary**

The 2002 Mitsubishi Montero, while generally reliable, is prone to age-related issues. Engine maintenance, particularly the timing belt, is crucial to prevent costly repairs. Suspension components and electrical systems are also common areas of concern. Addressing rust is vital for longevity. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, but owners should anticipate spending several hundred to several thousand dollars over the lifespan of the vehicle to address these potential problems.
