### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mitsubishi Montero is a capable and generally robust SUV, particularly favored for its off-road prowess. The most commonly reported issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, specifically potential coolant and oil leaks from the 3.8L V6 engine, and transmission issues like harsh shifting in the automatic or clutch wear in the manual. Suspension components, such as ball joints and bushings, can wear over time, leading to noises and handling issues. Electrical problems like alternator failure and window regulator malfunctions are also noted. Exterior rust, especially on the frame and body, is a significant concern for vehicles in corrosive environments. Interiorly, HVAC blower motor failures can impact comfort. Despite these points, many owners find the Montero to be a reliable vehicle when properly maintained, with its durable construction often outweighing the repair costs for specific components.
