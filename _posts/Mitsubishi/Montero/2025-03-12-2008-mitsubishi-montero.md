The Montero offers a blend of practicality and adventure, appealing to those seeking a capable family vehicle that can handle diverse terrains. Owners often appreciate its spacious interior, robust four-wheel-drive system, and comfortable ride on the road. However, some common complaints include its fuel economy, dated interior design, and potential maintenance costs associated with its complex systems.
