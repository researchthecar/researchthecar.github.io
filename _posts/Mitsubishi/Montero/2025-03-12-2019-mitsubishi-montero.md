The 2019 Mitsubishi Montero (also known as the Pajero in some markets) is a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and reliability. It's important to note that the Montero/Pajero was not sold in the US market in 2019. This response will focus on the versions sold internationally. The most common engine option is a 3.2L inline 4 cylinder diesel engine which produces around 190 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options, depending on the market, include a 3.0L V6 gasoline engine. Transmissions are typically a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Montero for its ruggedness, off-road performance, and spacious interior, but some criticize its fuel economy and somewhat dated design.

**Engine**

**3.2L Inline 4 Cylinder Diesel**

*   **Excessive Black Smoke on Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive black smoke emitted from the exhaust during acceleration, indicating incomplete combustion. Can be accompanied by a decrease in fuel economy and sluggish performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis should start with checking the air filter, fuel injectors, and EGR valve for proper functioning. A clogged or faulty EGR valve is a common culprit. Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve, along with cleaning or replacing the fuel injectors, is often necessary. A faulty mass airflow sensor could also contribute.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the components replaced and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the turbocharger, reduced engine power, and the engine entering limp mode. May also be accompanied by excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger assembly. It is important to identify and address the root cause of the turbo failure, such as oil starvation or foreign object damage, to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ (including labor and parts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6 Gasoline**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and jarring shifts between gears, particularly noticeable during upshifts.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, a fluid flush and filter replacement may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body issues or worn clutches within the transmission may be the cause, potentially requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping Between Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs increasing without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. Hesitation or complete failure to engage a gear.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition, then inspect for leaks. If the fluid appears to be in good condition, internal wear of the clutch packs or solenoid issues may be the culprit. A transmission rebuild or replacement is the likely solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (including labor and parts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable sagging of the rear suspension, especially when carrying passengers or cargo. This can affect ride quality, handling, and tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear coil springs or shocks. For vehicles with self-leveling suspension, the system may need to be diagnosed and repaired, potentially involving replacement of the air springs or compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on the components replaced and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Vague steering response.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and replacing worn bushings in the control arms, sway bar links, and other suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Door Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors not locking or unlocking properly with the remote or interior switches.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the central locking system, checking the door lock actuators, wiring harness, and the central locking module. Replacement of faulty actuators or the module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component replaced and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or after a short period of inactivity, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Performing a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the electrical drain. Common causes include faulty relays, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the source of the drain and the repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage and Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the vehicle's undercarriage, particularly in areas exposed to road salt. Rust may also appear on body panels, especially around wheel arches and door sills.
    *   Solution: Thorough cleaning and rust removal, followed by rust-proofing treatments or panel replacement if the rust is severe. Prevention involves regular washing and application of rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system blowing warm air, reduced cooling performance, or unusual noises from the compressor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the air conditioning system, checking for refrigerant leaks, compressor issues, and faulty components such as the expansion valve or condenser.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the component replaced and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Mitsubishi Montero can have some common issues, primarily related to the diesel engine (if equipped), automatic transmission, and suspension. Black smoke, turbocharger failures, and harsh shifting can be moderately expensive to repair. Rust is also a potential issue, particularly in regions with road salt. The severity and cost of these issues can vary greatly depending on the vehicle's maintenance history and operating conditions. Prospective buyers should pay close attention to these areas during inspection.
