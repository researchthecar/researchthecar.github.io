The 2016 Mitsubishi Montero, also known as the Pajero in some markets, is a full-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and spacious interior. In many markets, it was available with a 3.8-liter V6 engine producing around 247 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its robust build, comfortable ride, and go-anywhere attitude, but some dislike its fuel economy and dated interior design compared to newer competitors.
