The 2001 Mitsubishi Montero is a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and relatively spacious interior. The available engine was a 3.5L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 228 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its ruggedness and dependability in challenging terrains. Common complaints include its fuel economy and some age-related maintenance issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil consumption and potential burning smells.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can fail prematurely, leading to significant engine damage. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, or complete engine shutdown.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt and water pump at recommended intervals (typically every 60,000 miles) to prevent failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Various Locations)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can originate from various locations including the rear main seal, oil pan gasket, and camshaft seals. These leaks often result in oil consumption and visible oil spots.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the appropriate gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the location and complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or slipping during gear changes, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. This can worsen over time, leading to complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, internal repairs or a transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter change), $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears.
    *   Solution: Often caused by worn-out transmission fluid or valve body issues. A fluid flush and filter change might help. If that doesn't resolve the problem, valve body repair or replacement might be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter change), $500 - $1500+ (valve body repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning. Excessive play in the steering wheel.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, battery warning light illuminated, difficulty starting, or stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Body and Frame)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the body panels, undercarriage, and frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace affected panels, apply rust inhibitors and protective coatings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the severity; $100 - $1000s+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blower motor malfunctions, inoperative temperature controls, or blend door actuator failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component failure and replace accordingly (blower motor, resistor, blend door actuator).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Mitsubishi Montero, while generally reliable for its age, faces typical issues associated with older vehicles. The most significant concerns are potential engine problems such as timing belt failures and oil leaks. Transmission issues, specifically slipping, are also a recurring complaint. Suspension components like ball joints and electrical gremlins (power windows, alternators) can also require attention. Rust, particularly in regions with road salt, is a common problem. The cost of repairs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes (gaskets, window motors) to more substantial expenses like transmission rebuilds or engine work. Addressing these issues promptly can significantly extend the vehicle's lifespan.
