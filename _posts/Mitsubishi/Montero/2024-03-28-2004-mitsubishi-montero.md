The timing belt issue with the 3.5L V6 engine and transmission slippage with the 4-speed automatic transmission can be serious and costly to repair. However, many of the other issues are relatively minor and can be addressed at more reasonable costs. Overall, the Montero's issues do not seem to be overwhelmingly common and the majority can be resolved without breaking the bank.
