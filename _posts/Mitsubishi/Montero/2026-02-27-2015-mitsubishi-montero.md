### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mitsubishi Montero is a robust off-roader with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The most frequently cited issues revolve around potential leaks (coolant and oil) from the V6 engine and transmission problems such as harsh shifting in the automatic or clutch wear in the manual. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear over time, especially with heavy off-road use. Electrical concerns include potential alternator failures and issues with power window regulators. Exterior rust, particularly on the frame and lower body panels, is a significant concern for vehicles in corrosive environments. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor is a component that may require attention. Despite these points, many owners find the Montero to be a reliable and capable vehicle when properly maintained.
