Electrical issues, such as power window motor failures, are also noted but are not typically indicative of systemic problems. Minor fluid leaks from the rear differential seal have been reported. Despite these points, the Montero is generally considered a durable vehicle, especially for those prioritizing off-road capability and longevity, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of major design flaws.
