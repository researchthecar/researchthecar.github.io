The 2012 Mitsubishi Montero is a full-size SUV renowned for its rugged off-road capabilities and spacious interior. With its 3.8-liter V6 engine producing 266 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, it offers a robust performance both on and off-road. The Montero is also available with a 3.2-liter V6 rated at 230 horsepower or a 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6 producing 247 horsepower and 429 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed automatic for the 3.2-liter V6, a 6-speed automatic for the 3.8-liter V6, and a 5-speed automatic or 5-speed manual for the 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6.
