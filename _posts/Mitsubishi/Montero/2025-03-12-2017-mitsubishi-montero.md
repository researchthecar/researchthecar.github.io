The 2017 Mitsubishi Montero (also known as the Pajero in some markets) is a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and rugged design. It was available with a 3.8-liter V6 engine producing around 250 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its spacious interior and off-road prowess, but some find the fuel economy and dated technology to be drawbacks. It's a robust vehicle, but as with any car, specific issues can arise over time.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be observed in severe cases.
    * Solution: The issue often stems from worn piston rings or valve seals. Replacing these components is the most common fix. A compression test can help diagnose the extent of the wear.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating are common symptoms. The code often points to misfires in one or more cylinders.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the root cause, which could be faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. A scan tool can pinpoint the affected cylinder(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component and extent of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**
* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears, particularly noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue if it's due to contaminated fluid. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal component wear may require a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Delayed Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into drive or reverse and the vehicle actually moving.
    * Solution: This can indicate low transmission fluid level, a failing transmission pump, or internal wear in the transmission. A thorough inspection is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Reduced handling precision and uneven tire wear may also be noticed.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn bushings, which are typically made of rubber, is the standard fix. Inspecting ball joints and other suspension components is also recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the location and number of bushings replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Leaking Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the shock absorbers or struts, a bouncy or unstable ride, and increased body roll during cornering.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking shock absorbers or struts with new units. It's generally recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced performance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery repeatedly dying, even after being fully charged or replaced.
    * Solution: Tracing the source of the parasitic drain using a multimeter. Common causes include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a malfunctioning charging system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Power Windows/Locks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power windows or door locks to operate.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty window motor, lock actuator, or wiring harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window/lock
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rusting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation in the lower body panels and wheel wells.
    * Solution: Treating the rust by removing the affected metal and welding in new panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air blowing from the vents, even when the AC is set to maximum.
    * Solution: Checking the refrigerant level, compressor, condenser, and other AC components. A leak test may be necessary to identify any leaks in the system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the component needing repair or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Mitsubishi Montero, while a capable SUV, can experience some common issues. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption and misfires can be costly to address, as can transmission issues. Suspension and electrical problems are also possible and can add to the maintenance burden. While many of these issues are manageable, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential costs associated with repairing or maintaining them.
