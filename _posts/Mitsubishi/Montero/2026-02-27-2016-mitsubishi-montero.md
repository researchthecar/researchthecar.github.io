### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mitsubishi Montero generally exhibits good mechanical reliability, particularly with its V6 engines and available transmissions, which are known for their robustness. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to age and environmental exposure, such as rust on the frame and body, and specific component failures like front ball joints, alternators, and HVAC blend door actuators. Electrical issues, often stemming from the Body Control Module, can also arise. While not overwhelmingly problematic, owners should be mindful of these potential issues, especially when purchasing a used model, and ensure regular inspections, particularly for rust and suspension components, to maintain its legendary off-road capability and longevity.
