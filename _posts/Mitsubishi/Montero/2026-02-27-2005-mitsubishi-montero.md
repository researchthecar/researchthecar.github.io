Its V6 engines, while generally reliable, can experience issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and, if not maintained, timing belt problems. Automatic transmissions may develop torque converter or solenoid issues over time. Suspension components such as ball joints and bushings are common wear items. Electrically, window regulators and alternators are known to fail. Exterior rust can be a significant concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor is a common point of failure. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the Montero can remain a dependable vehicle.
