The 2006 Mitsubishi Montero is a capable and rugged SUV known for its off-road prowess and spacious interior. It was only offered with one engine option, a 3.8-liter V6 producing 215 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and robust 4WD system. Common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, some reliability concerns, and dated interior styling compared to newer SUVs.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6 (6G75)**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt can fail prematurely, leading to significant engine damage if not replaced at recommended intervals. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, and eventually a complete engine stall.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt, water pump, tensioner, and idler pulleys at the recommended interval (60,000 miles is often suggested, though verify in your owner's manual).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil consumption and potential oil drips onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light activation, decreased engine performance, rattling sounds from the exhaust system, and potential failure to pass emissions testing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty catalytic converter(s). The Montero uses multiple catalytic converters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on which converter and if OEM or aftermarket parts are used)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (V5A51)**

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or delay during gear shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. RPMs may increase without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change may alleviate the issue. In more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at highway speeds, particularly when the torque converter is locking and unlocking. This can also cause poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, rough ride, and failure of the air compressor. The air suspension system attempts to maintain a level ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs, air compressor, or height sensors. Many owners convert to a traditional coil spring suspension to eliminate future air suspension issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the component and whether converting to coil springs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering. This can lead to a dangerous situation if the ball joint completely fails.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate or operating slowly and erratically.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Climate Control Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty blend door actuators leading to inconsistent temperature control or failure to switch between hot and cold air.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, especially in areas prone to salt exposure (e.g., wheel wells, undercarriage).
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. Prevention is key.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Problems**

    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks and mechanism. In some cases, the sunroof motor or linkage needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Center Console LCD Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD screen in the center console (if equipped) may become dim or fail completely.
    *   Solution: Replacing the LCD screen or the entire center console unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
