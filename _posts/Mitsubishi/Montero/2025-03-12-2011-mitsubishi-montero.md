The 2011 Mitsubishi Montero, also known as the Mitsubishi Pajero in some markets, is a capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and reliability. The 2011 model typically came equipped with a 3.8-liter V6 engine producing around 250 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its robust build and go-anywhere capability, some owners have reported issues that are worth noting. Common pros include its comfortable ride (for an off-roader), spacious interior, and strong 4WD system. Cons often include its somewhat dated interior design, fuel economy, and availability of parts/service in some regions.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

* **Engine Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various areas, including the valve cover gaskets and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots under the vehicle, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Thoroughly clean the affected area after the repair to monitor for further leaks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on the source of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail, leading to a check engine light and potential failure to pass emissions testing. Symptoms include reduced engine performance, rattling noises from the exhaust, and a sulfur-like smell.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty catalytic converter. Ensure proper diagnosis to rule out other issues that could damage the new converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, especially between certain gears. This can be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might alleviate the issue in some cases. If the problem persists, valve body issues may require professional diagnosis and repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid/filter; $500 - $1500+ for valve body repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings, particularly in the front end, can wear out over time. Symptoms include clunking noises when going over bumps, vague steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the worn suspension bushings. It is often recommended to replace bushings in pairs (e.g., both front lower control arm bushings).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows. Can be caused by a faulty window motor, switch, or wiring harness.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific issue. Replacing the motor, switch, or repairing the wiring harness may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rusting of Body Panels**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners in regions with harsh winters or coastal areas have reported rust developing on the body panels, especially around the wheel wells and rocker panels.
    * Solution: Repair the rust by cutting out the affected metal, welding in new panels, and applying rustproofing treatments.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Air Conditioning Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may develop leaks or compressor failures, leading to weak or no cold air.
    * Solution: Diagnose the system for leaks, check the compressor, and replace any faulty components. A refrigerant recharge is also necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component needing replacement (condenser, compressor, etc.).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mitsubishi Montero is generally a reliable SUV, but some common issues owners have reported include engine oil leaks, catalytic converter failure, harsh transmission shifting, worn suspension bushings, and electrical and A/C problems. Rust can be a concern in certain climates. While some of these issues can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as catalytic converter or transmission problems, can be more costly. Prospective buyers should have a mechanic inspect the vehicle thoroughly, paying particular attention to the areas mentioned above, before making a purchase.
