### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mitsubishi Montero is a capable SUV with a generally solid mechanical foundation, especially its V6 engine and robust chassis. However, age is a significant factor, leading to common issues like intake manifold leaks and timing belt replacements on the 3.5L V6. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic, can arise, and manual clutch wear is expected. Suspension components, such as ball joints and bushings, are prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can also occur. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor may require attention. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these known weak points are crucial for maintaining the Montero's reliability.
