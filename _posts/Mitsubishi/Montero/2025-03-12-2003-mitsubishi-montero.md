The 2003 Mitsubishi Montero is a capable SUV known for its off-road prowess and comfortable ride. It was offered with a 3.8L V6 engine producing 215 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its spacious interior and robust build, while others find its fuel economy and relatively dated design to be drawbacks.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the timing belt breaks, it can cause catastrophic engine damage due to the Montero's interference engine design. Symptoms include sudden engine stall, inability to start the engine, and a clicking or rattling noise before failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, tensioner, and idler pulleys as part of scheduled maintenance (every 60,000 miles is recommended). If the belt breaks, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (depending on engine damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, leading to oil consumption and potential engine bay mess. Burning oil smell can also be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
