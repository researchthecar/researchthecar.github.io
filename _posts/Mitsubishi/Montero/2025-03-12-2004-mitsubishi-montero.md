**Summary**

The 2004 Mitsubishi Montero, while capable, can be prone to certain issues as it ages. Engine issues such as valve cover leaks and catalytic converter failures are common. Transmission problems, particularly related to shifting, may require fluid changes or more extensive repairs. Suspension components like ball joints and air springs are also known to wear out, contributing to handling problems. Electrical issues can arise with power windows and the alternator.
