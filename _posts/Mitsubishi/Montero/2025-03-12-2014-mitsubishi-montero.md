The 2014 Mitsubishi Montero, also known as the Pajero in some markets, is a full-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and spacious interior. In some markets, the 2014 Montero was offered with a 3.0L V6 engine producing around 175 horsepower and 187 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.2L inline-4 diesel engine with varying power outputs depending on the market. Depending on the market, the vehicle could be equipped with a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, or 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its ruggedness and off-road prowess but may find the fuel economy and on-road handling less appealing compared to more modern SUVs. Due to the vehicle not being sold in the USA, information is limited and can be inaccurate.
