The 2018 Mitsubishi Montero, also known as the Pajero in some markets, is a full-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and spacious interior. The 2018 model typically came with a 3.8-liter V6 engine producing around 247 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its ruggedness, off-road performance, and reliability. Common dislikes include its relatively dated interior, fuel economy, and handling on paved roads.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2018 Mitsubishi Montero presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from moderate to significant in terms of severity and cost. Engine oil consumption and catalytic converter problems can be costly to address. Transmission issues, while potentially manageable with maintenance, could lead to expensive repairs if left unaddressed. Suspension and electrical problems tend to be less severe and costly, but should still be addressed promptly to avoid further complications. The undercarriage rust is more common for vehicles in colder climates or environments that commonly use salt on the roads. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect these areas or be prepared to budget for potential repairs.
