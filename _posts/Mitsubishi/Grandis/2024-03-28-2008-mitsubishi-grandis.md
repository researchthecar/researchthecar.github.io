**Introduction:**

The 2008 Mitsubishi Grandis is a mid-size crossover SUV that offers a spacious interior and a standard 4-cylinder engine. It is available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The Grandis is praised for its comfortable seats and practical design, but it has received criticism for its dated appearance and lackluster performance.

**Engine**

* **2.4L 4-Cylinder**
    * **Intake Valve Deposits:** Carbon buildup on intake valves can cause rough idling, poor acceleration, and reduced fuel economy. Cleaning the intake valves is the solution, which costs around $200 - $400+.
    * **Timing Chain Noise:** A noisy timing chain can indicate a stretched chain that needs to be replaced. Replacing the timing chain typically costs between $800 - $1200+.
    * **Catalytic Converter Failure:** A faulty catalytic converter can cause reduced engine power, increased emissions, and a strong sulfur smell. Replacing the catalytic converter is the solution, which costs around $1000 - $1500+.
* **3.0L V6**
    * **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Automatic**
    * **Transmission Slippage:** Worn clutches or a faulty transmission control module can cause the transmission to slip gears. Rebuilding or replacing the transmission is usually necessary, which can cost between $2500 - $3500+.
* **6-Speed Manual**
    * **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension:**
    * **Strut Mount Noise:** Worn strut mounts can cause clunking or rattling noises when driving over bumps. Replacing the strut mounts usually costs around $200 - $400+.
* **Rear Suspension:**
    * **Coil Spring Sag:** Worn coil springs can cause the rear of the Grandis to sag, affecting handling and ride quality. Replacing the coil springs is the solution, which can cost between $400 - $600+.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic draw on the battery can cause it to drain quickly, leaving the Grandis unable to start. Diagnosing and fixing the electrical fault is necessary, which can cost $100 - $200+.
* **Alternator Failure:** A faulty alternator can fail to charge the battery, causing electrical problems and eventually leaving the Grandis stranded. Replacing the alternator typically costs between $500 - $700+.

**Exterior**

* **Fog Light Condensation:** Moisture buildup inside the fog light assembly can cause condensation, reducing visibility at night. Replacing the fog light assembly usually costs around $150 - $250+.

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** A faulty climate control module or blend door actuator can cause the heating or air conditioning system to malfunction. Replacing the faulty component typically costs between $300 - $500+.
* **Power Window Failure:** Worn window motors or faulty wiring can cause power windows to stop working. Replacing the window motor or wiring harness is the solution, which costs around $200 - $400+.

**Summary:**

The 2008 Mitsubishi Grandis has a number of potential issues, some of which can be costly to repair. Engine problems, transmission slippage, and suspension issues are the most common. While the Grandis offers a spacious interior and practical design, its dated appearance and lackluster performance may be a turnoff for some buyers.
