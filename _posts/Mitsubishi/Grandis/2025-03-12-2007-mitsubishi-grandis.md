The 2007 Mitsubishi Grandis is a seven-seater MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. Available engines included a 2.4-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 165 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine. Transmission options were typically a 4-speed automatic for the gasoline engine and a 6-speed manual or automatic for the diesel. Owners often appreciate the Grandis for its practicality and family-friendly features. Common dislikes include fuel economy (especially on the gasoline engine), some reports of electrical gremlins, and the availability of replacement parts in certain markets.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mitsubishi Grandis can be a reliable family vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, especially with the 2.4L gasoline engine (oil consumption) and the 2.0L diesel engine (DPF and turbocharger). Suspension wear and electrical gremlins are also potential concerns. Repair costs can range from minor fixes to more significant expenses depending on the specific problem. Rust, especially in certain climates, is another factor to consider. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
