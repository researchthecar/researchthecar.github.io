The 2008 Mitsubishi Grandis is a seven-seat MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) known for its spacious interior and practicality. In some markets, it was offered with a 2.4-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 163 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciated the Grandis for its comfortable ride and generous cargo space, some disliked its relatively weak engine performance and dated interior design.
