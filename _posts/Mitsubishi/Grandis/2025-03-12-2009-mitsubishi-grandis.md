The 2009 Mitsubishi Grandis is a seven-seater multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 2.4-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 163 horsepower and 161 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine (varies by market). The 2.4-liter engine is typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. What owners generally appreciate about the Grandis is its practicality for families and its smooth ride. Conversely, common dislikes include the relatively high fuel consumption and perceived lack of modern features compared to newer MPVs.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as the need to add a quart of oil every 1,000 miles or less.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and potentially switching to a higher viscosity oil may help. If the problem persists, a mechanic should inspect for leaks, worn piston rings, or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+, depending on the cause (e.g., minor leak vs. engine rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbodiesel Engine**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (paired with 2.4L Gasoline Engine)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or delayed engagement when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive. This can be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body issues or worn solenoids may require professional diagnosis and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+, depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision and increased tire wear may also occur.
    *   Solution: Inspection of suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.) and replacement of worn components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure of the central locking system to lock or unlock all doors. May affect individual doors or the entire system.
    *   Solution: Check the central locking system fuse and relay. If these are good, a mechanic should diagnose the wiring, door lock actuators, or the central locking control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+, depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Hatch Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear hatch failing to stay open on its own, requiring manual support.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear hatch struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blowing warm air, indicating a non-functional compressor.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the A/C system for leaks, followed by compressor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+, including labor and refrigerant recharge.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2009 Mitsubishi Grandis, while a practical MPV, can suffer from some common issues related to its engine (oil consumption with the 2.4L), transmission (rough shifting), suspension (worn bushings), electrical system (central locking), and interior (A/C compressor). The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly is crucial to maintaining the vehicle's reliability and safety. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission work, can be more costly.
