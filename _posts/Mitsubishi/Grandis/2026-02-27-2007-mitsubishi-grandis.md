### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mitsubishi Grandis offers a generally reliable ownership experience, with most reported issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic design flaws.

Transmission issues are infrequent but can involve clutch wear on manuals or fluid leaks on automatics. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and sensor faults, are not uncommon for a vehicle of this age. Suspension components like bushings can wear over time. Interior issues are usually minor, like rattles or HVAC blower motor failures. Overall, the Grandis is a solid choice if well-maintained, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific potential issues related to its powertrain and age.
