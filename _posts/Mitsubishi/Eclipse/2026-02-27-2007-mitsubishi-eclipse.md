### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the 2.4L, can experience common issues like oil leaks and timing belt problems, while the V6 has its own set of intake-related concerns. Transmission reliability varies, with automatics showing a higher propensity for issues than manuals. Suspension components like bushings and strut mounts are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, especially with the BCM and alternators, can be a concern. Exterior paint issues are not uncommon for vehicles of this age. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of potential repair costs related to these specific components.
