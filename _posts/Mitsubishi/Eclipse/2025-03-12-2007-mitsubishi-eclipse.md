The 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sporty coupe and convertible known for its distinctive styling and affordability. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 162 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque and a 3.8L V6 generating 263 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 4-cylinder was paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 came with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally liked the Eclipse's aggressive looks and handling, but common complaints revolved around build quality, reliability, and interior materials.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored closely. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: Addressing this issue may involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or ultimately overhauling the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6**

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the engine mounts, leading to excessive vibration, clunking noises, and potential damage to other components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed engine mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600

    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience slipping between gears, particularly during acceleration. Harsh or erratic shifting may also be present.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and filter change might alleviate minor issues. More serious cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the struts and shock absorbers, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased braking distances.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts/shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800

**Summary:**

The 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse has several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems like oil consumption (especially in the 2.4L) and engine mount failure (especially in the 3.8L) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly slipping in the 5-speed automatic, are also a concern. Suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior issues, such as strut failure, power window malfunctions, rust, and dashboard cracks, can add to the overall cost of ownership. While some repairs may be relatively inexpensive, others can be quite significant, making a thorough inspection and pre-purchase assessment crucial.
