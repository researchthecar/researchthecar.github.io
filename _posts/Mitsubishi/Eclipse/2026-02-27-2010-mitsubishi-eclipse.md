### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a reasonably reliable sports coupe, especially considering its age. The most common concerns tend to revolve around the engine (oil leaks, timing belt on the 4-cylinder) and transmission (automatic shifting issues). Electrical components like the BCM and alternator can also present problems. Exterior paint issues and interior wear are not uncommon for a vehicle of this vintage. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of potential maintenance costs related to these specific components. Regular servicing and addressing minor issues promptly can help mitigate more significant problems down the line.
