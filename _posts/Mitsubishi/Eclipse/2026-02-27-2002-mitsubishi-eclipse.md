### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mitsubishi Eclipse, while offering an engaging driving experience, exhibits common reliability concerns typical for its age and segment. The 2.4L and 3.0L engines can suffer from oil leaks and timing belt issues, respectively, while the automatic transmission may develop slipping problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior climate control and power window systems may require attention. Despite these potential issues, many problems are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, making it a potentially rewarding car for enthusiasts willing to invest in its upkeep.
