### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse, particularly models equipped with the 4G63T engine, can be a rewarding car but requires attention to potential issues. Engine reliability can be a concern, with head gasket failures on the 2.4L and turbocharger/cylinder head issues on the 2.0L turbo being notable. Transmissions, both manual and automatic, can experience wear and tear, leading to clutch or internal component failures. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and power window problems are also reported. Exterior rust can be a significant factor depending on climate. Interior issues like HVAC blower motor failure and dashboard cracking are also present. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these common repair areas and budget accordingly for maintenance and potential repairs.
