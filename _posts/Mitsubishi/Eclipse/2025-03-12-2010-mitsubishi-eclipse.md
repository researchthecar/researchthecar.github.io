The 2010 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sporty coupe and convertible known for its stylish design and affordable price point. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 162 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque and a 3.8L V6 generating 265 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. The inline-4 is paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 comes with a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. People generally like the Eclipse's aggressive styling, comfortable front seats, and decent handling. Downsides often cited are the limited rear passenger space, subpar fuel economy (especially with the V6), and some cheap interior plastics.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Regularly monitor oil levels and address any leaks. A compression test can help diagnose if the issue is internal. In some cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (for piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased acceleration, and illuminated check engine light. Often caused by worn spark plugs or faulty ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replace spark plugs and/or faulty ignition coils. Diagnose and repair any vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the number of coils and plugs replaced and if there are vacuum leaks)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (2.4L Inline-4)**
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, especially between first and second gear. Can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn solenoids, or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Check and replace transmission fluid. If the problem persists, a transmission service or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $2,500+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (3.8L V6)**

*   **Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs high without corresponding acceleration, indicating the transmission isn't properly engaging gears.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. Could indicate a failing torque converter or worn clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and shocks. It's recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Noisy Wheel Bearings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise that increases with speed, often heard from one or more wheels.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected wheel bearing(s).

**Summary**

The 2010 Mitsubishi Eclipse can be a fun and stylish car, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine issues such as oil consumption and misfires can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic transmissions, are another area of concern. Suspension and electrical problems are also present but are not as severe. Addressing these issues before they escalate can save money in the long run. The severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially expensive repairs. Overall, pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic is highly recommended.
