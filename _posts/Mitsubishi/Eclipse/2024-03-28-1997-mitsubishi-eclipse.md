**Introduction:**

The 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a popular sports coupe known for its sleek design and handling capabilities. It was available with a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 2.0L inline-4, a 2.4L V6, and a choice of manual or automatic transmissions. While the Eclipse received praise for its performance and style, it has also experienced some common issues over the years.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

* **Head gasket failure:** Blown head gaskets can cause coolant and oil to leak, leading to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, low coolant levels, and oil in the coolant. Fix involves replacing the head gasket and possibly the cylinder head. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Timing belt failure:** Timing belts can snap, causing the engine to lose timing and potentially resulting in valve damage. Symptoms include sudden loss of power, rattling noises from the engine, and check engine light illumination. Fix involves replacing the timing belt and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+

**2.4L V6**

* **VVT solenoid failure:** Variable Valve Timing (VVT) solenoids can fail, affecting engine performance and fuel economy. Symptoms include rough idle, poor acceleration, and check engine light illumination. Fix involves replacing the faulty VVT solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Intake manifold gasket leak:** Intake manifold gaskets can fail, causing vacuum leaks and rough idle. Symptoms include decreased engine power, poor fuel economy, and check engine light illumination. Fix involves replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Transmission**

**Manual Transmission**

* **Synchronizer wear:** Synchronizers can wear out over time, causing difficulty shifting gears. Symptoms include grinding noises when shifting, difficulty engaging specific gears, and check engine light illumination. Fix involves replacing worn synchronizers and other transmission components as needed. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,500+
* **Clutch failure:** Clutches can wear out or burn out, causing difficulty shifting gears or a loss of power. Symptoms include slipping gears, difficulty engaging gears, and a burning smell. Fix involves replacing the clutch assembly. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

**Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission slipping:** Automatic transmissions can slip, causing a loss of power and delayed shifting. Symptoms include hesitation or slippage when shifting gears, and check engine light illumination. Fix involves replacing or rebuilding the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
* **Solenoid failure:** Transmission solenoids can fail, affecting fluid flow and gear engagement. Symptoms include harsh shifting, delayed shifting, and check engine light illumination. Fix involves replacing the faulty solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** Struts can wear out or fail, affecting ride quality and handling. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, loss of control, and uneven tire wear. Fix involves replacing the struts and associated components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+
* **Ball joint failure:** Ball joints can wear out, causing clunking noises and reduced steering control. Symptoms include noise when turning or braking, excessive play in the steering wheel, and uneven tire wear. Fix involves replacing the ball joints. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** Alternators can fail, resulting in electrical system malfunction. Symptoms include dim headlights, electrical component failure, and a battery that will not charge. Fix involves replacing the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Battery failure:** Batteries can weaken or fail over time, leading to starting problems. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle, electrical component failure, and a check engine light illumination. Fix involves replacing the battery. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+

**Exterior**

* **Rust on rear quarter panels:** Rear quarter panels are prone to rust, especially in areas with high salt exposure. Symptoms include bubbling or flaking paint, holes in the metal, and a loss of structural integrity. Fix involves cutting out the rusted area and welding in new metal. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Headlight switch failure:** Headlight switches can fail, preventing the headlights from turning on. Symptoms include no headlights, flickering headlights, and check engine light illumination. Fix involves replacing the headlight switch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Interior**

* **Window regulator failure:** Window regulators can fail, causing the windows to become stuck or inoperable. Symptoms include windows that do not open or close properly, and a humming or clicking noise from the door. Fix involves replacing the window regulator assembly. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Seatbelt pretensioner failure:** Seatbelt pretensioners can fail to deploy during a collision, increasing the risk of injury. Symptoms include a check engine light illumination, a warning message on the instrument panel, and a loose seatbelt. Fix involves replacing the seatbelt pretensioner. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**Summary**

The 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse can encounter various issues, ranging from minor electrical problems to more serious engine and transmission failures. Some of the most common issues include head gasket failure, timing belt failure, transmission slipping, and suspension problems. While the severity of these issues can vary, many require costly repairs. It is important for owners to be aware of these potential problems and to have their vehicles regularly inspected and maintained to prevent major breakdowns and costly repairs.
