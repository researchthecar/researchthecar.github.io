**Introduction:**

The 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sports coupe powered by a 2.0L naturally aspirated engine delivering 140 horsepower and 134 lb-ft of torque. It features a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The Eclipse is known for its sporty handling and aggressive styling, but it has also been criticized for its lack of power and subpar interior quality.

**Engine**

**2.0L Naturally Aspirated**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Causes coolant leaks, rough idling, and reduced engine power. Requires replacement of the intake manifold gasket. **$200 - $400**
* **Head Gasket Failure:** Can lead to blown head gasket, overheating, and coolant or oil leaks. Involves replacing the head gasket and associated components. **$800 - $1,200**
* **Timing Belt Replacement:** Recommended at 60,000-mile intervals to prevent engine damage. Involves replacing the timing belt, tensioner, and related components. **$500 - $800**

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Synchronizer Failure:** Causes difficulty engaging gears, especially while shifting into higher gears. Requires replacement of the worn synchronizers. **$400 - $600**
* **Clutch Disc Failure:** Worn clutch disc can lead to slipping, shuddering, or difficulty shifting. Requires replacement of the clutch disc, pressure plate, and other components. **$600 - $1,000**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Solenoid Failure:** Faulty solenoids can cause shifting problems, delayed engagement, or lack of power. Involves replacement of the affected solenoid. **$200 - $400**
* **Torque Converter Failure:** Damaged torque converter can lead to transmission overheating, slipping, or shuddering. Requires replacement of the torque converter. **$1,200 - $1,800**

**Suspension**

* **Front Sway Bar End Links:** Worn end links can cause clunking noises, reduced stability, and uneven tire wear. Replacement of the end links resolves the issue. **$100 - $200**
* **Rear Shock Mount Failure:** Damaged shock mounts can affect ride comfort, handling, and alignment. Involves replacing the shock mounts. **$300 - $500**

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** Faulty alternator can lead to battery drain, dimming lights, or difficulty starting the vehicle. Requires replacement of the alternator. **$300 - $450**
* **Starter Solenoid Failure:** Worn starter solenoid can cause difficulty starting the engine or a no-start condition. Replacement of the solenoid is necessary. **$150 - $300**

**Exterior**

* **Tail Light Seal Failure:** Moisture can enter the tail lights, causing condensation and electrical issues. Requires replacement of the tail light seals. **$100 - $200**
* **Window Regulator Failure:** Malfunctioning regulators can cause windows to become inoperable or stuck. Replacement of the regulator is needed. **$200 - $400**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Rattle:** Plastic components in the dashboard can become loose, causing annoying rattles. Requires proper adjustment or tightening of the affected parts. **$50 - $150**
* **Door Panel Sagging:** Poorly secured door panels can sag over time. Reattaching or reinforcing the door panels solves the issue. **$100 - $200**

**Summary:**

The 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse has several potential issues that can affect its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components. While some issues, such as the intake manifold gasket failure, can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others like head gasket failure or transmission replacement can be costly. It's important to note that the severity and frequency of these issues may vary depending on the vehicle's maintenance history and driving conditions.
