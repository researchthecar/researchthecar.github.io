The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse was a sporty coupe or convertible offered with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 and a 3.8L V6. The 2.4L produced around 162 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. The 3.8L V6 offered significantly more power, with approximately 263 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Some owners praise the Eclipse for its stylish design and relatively affordable price point, while others dislike its reliability issues and somewhat cramped rear seating.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by worn piston rings or valve stem seals. Requires engine disassembly and repair or replacement of the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn or broken engine mounts can cause excessive engine vibration, noise, and clunking sounds, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn engine mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.8L V6 is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, severe engine damage can occur. Symptoms of a failing timing belt include a ticking noise from the engine, difficulty starting, and rough running.
    *   Solution: Regular replacement of the timing belt at the recommended interval (typically around 60,000 miles). If the timing belt breaks, the engine may require extensive repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Timing belt replacement: $500 - $1000+. If the timing belt breaks, engine repair can cost $2,000 - $5,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (2.4L)**

*   **Shift Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hard shifting, delayed engagement, or slipping between gears. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Start by checking and changing the transmission fluid. If that doesn't resolve the issue, further diagnosis may be required, potentially involving valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change: $100 - $200. Valve body repair/replacement: $500 - $1500. Transmission rebuild/replacement: $2,000 - $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic (3.8L)**

*   **Shift Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or delayed shifts, slipping, or failure to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change: $100 - $200. Valve body repair/replacement: $500 - $1500. Transmission rebuild/replacement: $2,000 - $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the struts and shocks, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per pair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, a dead battery, and a warning light on the dashboard are common symptoms of a failing alternator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
