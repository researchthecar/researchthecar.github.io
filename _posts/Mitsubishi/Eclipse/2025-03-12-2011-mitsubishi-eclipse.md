The 2011 Mitsubishi Eclipse was available as a coupe or convertible (Spyder). Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 162 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 generating 265 hp and 262 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L was available with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.8L V6 came standard with a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Eclipse for its sporty styling and relatively affordable price point. Common complaints included subpar fuel economy (especially with the V6), limited rear seat space in the coupe, and the dated interior.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil levels and potentially blue exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: The most common solution is to monitor oil levels closely and top off as needed. In severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly, $1,500+ for piston ring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6**

* **Timing Belt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.8L V6 engine uses a timing belt rather than a timing chain. If the timing belt fails, catastrophic engine damage can occur. Symptoms include loud ticking noises and a complete engine stall.
    * Solution: Regular replacement of the timing belt at the manufacturer-recommended interval is crucial (typically every 60,000 miles or 6 years).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ for timing belt replacement. Engine repair following failure can be much higher.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (2.4L)**

No Issues Found

**5-Speed Automatic (3.8L)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported experiencing harsh shifting or transmission slippage, especially at higher mileage. This can be due to worn valve body components or internal clutch wear.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush might provide temporary relief in some cases. However, more extensive repairs, such as valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild/replacement, are often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+ for fluid flush, $800 - $1,500+ for valve body, $2,000 - $4,000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Degradation of the factory struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, reduced handling performance, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts and shocks is the recommended solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ for parts and labor (for all four).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Power Windows**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power windows is a relatively common complaint. This is often attributed to faulty window motors or regulators.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the defective window motor or regulator assembly is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **ABS Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the anti-lock braking system (ABS) sensors can trigger the ABS warning light on the dashboard. This can compromise the functionality of the ABS system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ABS sensor is the recommended fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rust developing on the rear wheel arches, especially in regions with harsh winters and road salt use.
    *   Solution: Repair involves sanding, treating the rust, and repainting the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per wheel arch, depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In hot climates, the dashboard can be prone to cracking, particularly around the instrument cluster and air vents.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the most effective solution, but it can be costly. A dashboard cover is a less expensive alternative to mask the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ for dashboard replacement. $50 - $150+ for a dashboard cover.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mitsubishi Eclipse can be a stylish and fun-to-drive car, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 3.8L V6 timing belt service, potential transmission issues (especially on higher mileage vehicles), and electrical component failures. While some problems are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can lead to costly repairs. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the vehicle's overall condition and identify any potential issues.
