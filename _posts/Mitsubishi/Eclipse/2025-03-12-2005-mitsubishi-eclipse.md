The 2005 Mitsubishi Eclipse was a sporty coupe and convertible known for its stylish design and affordability. It offered a few engine options, including a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 162 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine rated at 210 hp and 205 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the car's looks and handling, but reliability issues and build quality were frequent criticisms.

**Summary**

The 2005 Mitsubishi Eclipse, while stylish, suffers from several common issues, ranging from engine and transmission problems to suspension and electrical faults. Engine issues include excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L and timing belt problems in the 3.0L. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can be costly. Suspension components and electrical systems are also prone to failure. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in certain climates. Many of the potential repairs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, so a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
