## Engine

### 2.4L 4-Cylinder (4G69)
**Oil Consumption**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil burning, potentially leading to low oil levels and engine damage if not monitored.
- **Solution:** Regular oil checks and top-offs. In severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500

**Timing Belt Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Sudden engine stoppage, loss of power, potential for severe internal engine damage if the belt breaks.
- **Solution:** Timely replacement of the timing belt and tensioner according to manufacturer recommendations.
- **Cost:** $500 - $800


### 3.0L V6 (6G72)
**Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Vacuum leaks, rough idle, potential coolant leaks into the engine.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Manual
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Clutch replacement (clutch kit including pressure plate, disc, and release bearing).
- **Cost:** $700 - $1200


### 4-Speed Automatic
**Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, slipping between gears, rough shifts.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change. If issues persist, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be needed.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800 (fluid change); $2000 - $4000 (rebuild/replacement)


### CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)
**CVT Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Jerking, slipping, loss of drive, warning lights.
- **Solution:** CVT fluid service. Often requires complete CVT unit replacement.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600 (fluid service); $3000 - $5000 (replacement)


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Strut Mount Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noises when turning, especially at low speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of strut mounts.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows malfunctioning, interior lights flickering, door locks acting erratically.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


### Alternator
**Alternator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Battery warning light illuminated, dimming headlights, dead battery.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Exterior

### Body Panels
**Clear Coat Peeling**

- **Cost:** $50 - $200 (restoration); $300 - $600 (replacement)


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blend Door Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Inability to control temperature (stuck on hot or cold), air only coming from certain vents.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blend door actuator(s).
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


### Seat Fabric
**Excessive Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Tearing or excessive wear on seat bolsters and fabric, particularly on the driver's seat.
- **Solution:** Seat cover installation or professional upholstery repair/replacement.
- **Cost:** $100 - $500

### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse, while offering an engaging driving experience, presents a mixed reliability picture. Owners should be aware of potential issues with oil consumption and timing belt maintenance on the 4-cylinder engines, and intake manifold leaks on the V6. Transmission reliability varies, with the CVT being a notable concern for potential costly failures. Suspension components like bushings and strut mounts can wear over time. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, are also reported. Exterior paint and interior wear are common for vehicles of this age. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to reported issues are crucial for maintaining the 2006 Eclipse.
