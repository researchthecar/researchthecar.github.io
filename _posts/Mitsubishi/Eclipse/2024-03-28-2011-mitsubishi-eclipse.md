**Introduction to the 2011 Mitsubishi Eclipse**

The 2011 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a compact sports car offered in two trim levels: GS and GT. The GS comes equipped with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine producing 162 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, while the GT receives a more powerful 3.8-liter V6 engine generating 265 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, and the GT also offers a six-speed manual transmission as an option. Reviewers praise the Eclipse for its stylish design, nimble handling, and comfortable interior, but criticize its lack of rear legroom, outdated infotainment system, and sluggish four-speed automatic transmission.
