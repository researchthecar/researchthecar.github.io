The 2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sporty coupe and convertible known for its bold styling. Engine options include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 162 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 generating 265 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. The 4-cylinder is paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 is mated to a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Eclipse's aggressive aesthetics and responsive handling, but some common criticisms include its heavy weight, limited rear visibility, and the quality of interior materials.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption. This can manifest as the need to add oil more frequently between scheduled oil changes. Low oil levels can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and addressing any leaks. Some owners have reported success with switching to a higher viscosity oil. In severe cases, engine repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6**

*   **Timing Belt Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the timing belt tensioner can cause the timing belt to skip or break. This leads to significant engine damage, including bent valves and damaged pistons. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, rough running, or complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt, tensioner, and water pump as a preventative measure. Inspect the tensioner regularly if the timing belt hasn't been replaced. If the timing belt breaks, extensive engine repairs or replacement are required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (2.4L Inline-4)**

No Issues Found

**5-Speed Automatic (3.8L V6)**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed automatic transmission has been known to exhibit erratic shifting behavior, including harsh shifts, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or fluid flush can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, transmission repair or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual (3.8L V6)**
No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts on the Eclipse can wear out prematurely, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive tire wear. Noises from the suspension, such as clunking or squeaking, are also common.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts with new units. It's recommended to replace both struts on an axle at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, resulting in a dead battery, dimming lights, and eventual stalling of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed alternator with a new or remanufactured unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the power window motor. This manifests as the window not being able to roll up or down.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation along the lower body panels, particularly around the wheel wells and rocker panels, is a common issue, especially in areas with harsh winters or high road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Repair and repaint the affected areas. Rust prevention measures, such as regular washing and waxing, can help slow down the process.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, especially in hot climates.
    * Solution: Replace the dashboard. Dashboard covers can be installed to cover the cracks and improve the appearance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse, while stylish, exhibits several common issues. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption in the 2.4L and timing belt tensioner failure in the 3.8L V6, can be costly. The 5-speed automatic transmission can have erratic shifting which may also require repair. Suspension and electrical issues, like strut and alternator failures, are also reported. Rust along lower body panels is another common problem. While some repairs may be relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and carefully inspect any prospective purchase.
