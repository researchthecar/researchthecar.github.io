### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sporty coupe that, while generally reliable, has some common issues to watch out for. The naturally aspirated engines are fairly robust, but the turbocharged 4G63T engine, especially if modified, can be prone to turbocharger and head gasket issues. Automatic transmissions may develop slipping problems, and manual clutches will eventually wear out. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and alternators, can occur. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the blower motor may fail. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing these known issues, the 2004 Eclipse can remain a fun and dependable vehicle.
