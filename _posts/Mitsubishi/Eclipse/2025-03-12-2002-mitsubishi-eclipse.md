The 2002 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sporty coupe known for its stylish design and affordable price. Engine options included a 2.4L 4-cylinder producing 147 horsepower and 158 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 generating 200 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Eclipse's looks and handling, but common complaints revolve around reliability issues and maintenance costs, particularly as the cars age.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4-Cylinder**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, often stemming from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature engine mount wear and failure leading to excessive engine vibration, rough idling, and clunking noises when accelerating or decelerating.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed engine mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

* **Timing Belt Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The timing belt is a critical component in this engine. If not replaced according to the maintenance schedule (typically every 60,000 miles), it can break, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include rough running, a ticking noise from the engine, and eventually, a no-start condition.
    * Solution: Replacing the timing belt and water pump (often recommended together). If the timing belt breaks, extensive engine repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for preventative maintenance. If the belt breaks, $1,500 - $3,000+ for engine repair or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Valve Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, causing poor engine performance, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. Slipping, where the engine revs up but the car doesn't accelerate properly, is also a common complaint.
    * Solution: Often requires a transmission rebuild or replacement. Fluid changes *may* help in minor cases but are unlikely to fully resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering or vibrating at low speeds, particularly when accelerating from a stop.
    * Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut/Shock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shocks can cause a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased braking distances. Noises such as clunking and rattling are also common.
    * Solution: Replacement of the struts and shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sway Bar Link Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Broken or worn sway bar links can cause clunking noises, especially when going over bumps or turning. This affects handling and stability.
    * Solution: Replacement of the sway bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Alternator failure can lead to a dead battery, dimming lights, and eventually, the car stalling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power window motors can fail, preventing the windows from operating.
    * Solution: Replacement of the window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust is a significant issue, especially in areas with road salt. Common rust locations include the rear quarter panels, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    * Solution: Rust repair, which can range from patching small areas to replacing entire body panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and location.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The dashboard is prone to cracking, especially in warmer climates.

**Summary**
The 2002 Mitsubishi Eclipse, while stylish and affordable, suffers from a range of issues typical of vehicles of its age. Engine and transmission problems, particularly related to oil leaks, timing belts (V6), and automatic transmission harsh shifting/slipping, can be costly. Suspension and electrical issues also contribute to maintenance expenses. Rust is a major concern, especially in certain climates. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing this vehicle.
