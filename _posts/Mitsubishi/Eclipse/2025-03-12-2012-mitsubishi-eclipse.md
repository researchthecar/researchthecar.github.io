The 2012 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sporty coupe/convertible known for its stylish design and relatively affordable price point. Engine options for this year include a 2.4L inline-4 producing 162 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 generating 265 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine comes standard with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.8L V6 is paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the Eclipse's sporty look and decent handling, while common dislikes include its somewhat dated interior, limited rear visibility, and less than stellar fuel economy.
