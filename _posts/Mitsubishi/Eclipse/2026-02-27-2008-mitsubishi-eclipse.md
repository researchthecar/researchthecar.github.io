# 2008 Mitsubishi Eclipse

### Overview
The 2008 Mitsubishi Eclipse, a sporty compact coupe, offered a blend of performance and style. It was available with two primary engine options: a 2.4L naturally aspirated four-cylinder and a more potent 3.8L V6. Both engines were generally considered reliable, though specific issues could arise with age and mileage. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual (for the V6), and a 6-speed automatic. While the manual transmissions were robust, the automatic could occasionally present issues. Overall, the Eclipse is known for decent reliability, but like any vehicle, it's susceptible to certain common problems that owners should be aware of, particularly concerning its age.
