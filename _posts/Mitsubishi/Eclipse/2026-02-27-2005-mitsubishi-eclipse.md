### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mitsubishi Eclipse presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.4L engine is generally robust but can suffer from oil leaks and requires timely timing belt service. The 3.0L V6 is more prone to intake manifold and oil pan gasket leaks. Automatic transmissions may experience slipping or overheating issues, while manual transmissions are more durable but subject to clutch wear. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts are common wear items. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior paint degradation and interior wear, especially on seats and the HVAC blower motor, are also noted concerns. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential maintenance and repair points.
