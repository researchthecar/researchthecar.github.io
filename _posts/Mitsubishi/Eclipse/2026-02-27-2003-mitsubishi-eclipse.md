# 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse

### Overview
The 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse, particularly in its third generation, presented a mixed bag of reliability. While offering sporty styling and decent performance for its class, certain powertrain and component areas have shown a propensity for issues that go beyond routine maintenance. Owners have reported concerns primarily related to the engine and transmission, especially with the more performance-oriented variants. Electrical gremlins and some interior wear are also noted. However, the chassis and exterior generally hold up well, with fewer widespread complaints. Understanding these potential weak points is crucial for prospective buyers and current owners looking to maintain their Eclipse.

### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a car that requires careful consideration regarding its reliability. While the 2.4L engine is generally more robust, the 3.0L V6 and both automatic and manual transmissions have documented issues that can be costly to repair. Common problems include oil leaks, timing belt concerns, transmission shifting problems, and clutch wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can also surface. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are typical wear items. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the Eclipse enjoyable to drive, but proactive maintenance and awareness of these common issues are key to a positive ownership experience.
