The 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sporty coupe known for its stylish design and affordability. The base engine is a 2.4L inline-4 producing 147 horsepower and 158 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. A more powerful option is the 3.0L V6 engine making 210 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque, also available with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic. People often appreciate the Eclipse for its aggressive styling and relatively low price point. However, common complaints include the quality of interior materials, the reliability of certain components, and the car's age impacting parts availability.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L engine in the 2003 Eclipse is known to develop excessive oil consumption. This often manifests as the need to add oil frequently between changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potentially fouled spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Repair options range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, or even a full engine rebuild depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing belt is a crucial component of the engine. Over time, the belt can crack, fray, or break. Symptoms include engine misfires, rough running, or complete engine failure if the belt snaps.
    *   Solution: The timing belt, tensioner, and water pump should be replaced at regular intervals (typically every 60,000-90,000 miles).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+

**3.0L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve cover gaskets on the 3.0L V6 can become brittle and leak over time. Oil leaks can be visible on the engine, leading to a burning smell, and potentially causing low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or jerky shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear or during downshifts. This could indicate wear in the transmission or issues with the solenoids.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may improve shifting. If the issue persists, solenoid replacement or a transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
