The 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It's powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its compact size for city driving and its comprehensive warranty. Common dislikes include the engine's lack of power and the somewhat dated interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L engine consuming oil at a rate higher than expected. This can lead to low oil levels, potentially causing engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Symptoms include needing to add oil more frequently than usual, blue exhaust smoke, and/or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly is critical. If excessive consumption is confirmed, potential solutions include replacing the PCV valve, performing an engine flush, or, in severe cases, rebuilding or replacing the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (PCV valve) - $5,000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation upon acceleration or, in some cases, the engine stalling, especially at lower speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: The issue could stem from a variety of causes, including a faulty mass airflow sensor, a dirty throttle body, or issues with the fuel injectors. Diagnosis involves checking for error codes and testing individual components. Cleaning the throttle body and replacing the MAF sensor are common starting points.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (throttle body cleaning) - $300+ (MAF sensor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **CVT Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerking or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This may feel like a stutter or momentary loss of power.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change, using the correct Mitsubishi-specified fluid, can sometimes resolve minor issues. If the problem persists, the CVT may require more extensive diagnosis and potential repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a noticeable whining noise coming from the transmission area, especially during acceleration. This noise may become more pronounced over time.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change, using the correct Mitsubishi-specified fluid, can sometimes resolve minor issues. If the problem persists, the CVT may require more extensive diagnosis and potential repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash completely. This can affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer may resolve the issue. In some cases, the infotainment unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (infotainment unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure or distortion of the backup camera image. The camera may not activate when the vehicle is put in reverse or display a blurry or distorted image.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring for damage or corrosion. If the wiring is sound, the camera unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (backup camera replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported various rattling and squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, and rear cargo area. These noises can be exacerbated by rough road surfaces.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the noise and applying felt pads or foam insulation can help dampen the vibrations. This is often a process of trial and error.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ (depending on the extent of the issue and whether a professional is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport presents a mix of issues, some of which could be significant. While some problems like rattling noises are relatively minor and inexpensive to address, engine and transmission issues, if they occur, can be more severe and costly to repair. The potential for CVT issues and engine oil consumption warrants careful consideration for prospective buyers, as preventative maintenance and regular monitoring are essential.
