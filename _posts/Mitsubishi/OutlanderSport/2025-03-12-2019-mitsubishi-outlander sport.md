The 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a compact SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It typically comes with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate its spacious cargo area and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints revolve around its lackluster acceleration, dated interior design, and the performance of the continuously variable transmission (CVT). It has been criticized for its engine performance on the highway.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and using a higher viscosity oil may help. In severe cases, piston ring replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Hesitation/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation during acceleration or jerking motions while driving, especially at lower speeds. The transmission may feel sluggish or unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may help alleviate the issue. In some cases, a CVT fluid flush or replacement may be necessary. In extreme cases, complete transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (Software update), $200 - $400+ (Fluid change), $3,000 - $5,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted the early wear of components such as struts, shocks, and bushings, leading to a bumpy or unstable ride, as well as unusual noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per component depending on labor and part quality.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent screen freezes, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and general unresponsiveness of the infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes fix these glitches. In other cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update), $300 - $800+ (Head Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery draining faster than it should, leading to issues such as difficulty starting the engine or needing to jump start the vehicle.
    * Solution: Could be caused by old battery, parasitic drain, or another deeper electrical issue. Battery should be load tested and replaced, and the electrical system can be tested to determine the cause of the drain.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 (Battery), $100+ (Electrical Testing)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Poor Quality Exterior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Certain trim pieces on the exterior of the vehicle, such as plastic cladding or chrome accents, may be prone to premature fading, cracking, or becoming loose over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected trim pieces.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per trim piece, depending on the specific part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and securing loose panels or components. Applying foam padding or sound-deadening material may help reduce the noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (Depending on the severity and source of the rattle).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport has some common issues, primarily revolving around its CVT transmission's performance, potential for excessive oil consumption, and electrical gremlins. While these issues aren't universally experienced, they're worth noting for potential buyers. The severity and cost of repairs vary, but CVT-related problems could potentially lead to more significant expenses. Addressing suspension wear early can help avoid further complications. The infotainment glitches can be frustrating, but software updates or head unit replacement usually resolves them.
