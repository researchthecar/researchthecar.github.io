The 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a compact SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. The standard engine is a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate its comfortable ride and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include its underpowered engine and somewhat dated interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 Cylinder**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil light illuminating frequently, and visible smoke from the exhaust in some severe cases.
    * Solution: The cause is usually worn piston rings or valve stem seals. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the issue. Repairs may include replacing the piston rings or valve stem seals, or in severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Purge Valve Solenoid**
    * Description/Symptoms: The purge valve solenoid is responsible for sending fuel vapors from the gas tank to the engine to be burned. When the purge valve solenoid goes bad, the engine may run rough or stall. The check engine light will likely be illuminated with codes such as P0441, P0446, or P0455.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty purge valve solenoid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **CVT Jutter or Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing shuddering, hesitation, or jerky movements, especially during acceleration at lower speeds.
    * Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can alleviate the issue. However, if the problem persists, it may indicate internal wear or damage within the CVT. Some owners have had to replace the entire CVT assembly. Regular CVT fluid changes are essential to mitigate this issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: CVT fluid change $200 - $400; CVT replacement $4,000 - $7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Complete failure of the CVT, rendering the vehicle inoperable. Symptoms may include loud noises, inability to accelerate, or the transmission slipping excessively.
    * Solution: Complete CVT replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Struts and Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have noted that the struts and shocks wear out more quickly than expected, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride, particularly over bumps.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn struts and shocks. Consider upgrading to a higher-quality aftermarket option for improved durability.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500 (depending on parts and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty TPMS Sensors**
    * Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) light illuminates even when tire pressure is correct, or inconsistent readings from individual sensors.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty TPMS sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per sensor (depending on if DIY or professional)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle battery drains prematurely, especially when the car is left unused for a few days. This may require jump-starts or battery replacement.
    * Solution: Check for parasitic drains (e.g., aftermarket accessories, lights staying on). A load test of the battery and alternator may be necessary to identify faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Infotainment System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Infotainment system freezes, crashes, or experiences connectivity problems with Bluetooth or Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.
    * Solution: Software updates (if available), resetting the system, or replacing the head unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Undercarriage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature rusting on the undercarriage, especially in areas with high salt exposure (snowy climates).
    * Solution: Rust prevention treatments (e.g., undercoating) and regular washing of the undercarriage. Repair or replacement of severely rusted components may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (rust prevention) - $1,000+ (rust repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof malfunctions, including sticking, failing to open or close properly, or leaking.
    * Solution: Lubrication of tracks, repair or replacement of motor or seals, or replacement of the entire sunroof assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport has several common issues, with engine and transmission problems being potentially the most severe and costly. While minor electrical and interior issues are also present, the excessive oil consumption, CVT issues, and premature suspension wear are primary concerns for owners. Addressing these issues promptly can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity. Overall, the issues range from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs.
