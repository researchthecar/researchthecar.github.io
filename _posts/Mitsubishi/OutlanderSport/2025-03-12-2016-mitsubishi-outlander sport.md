The 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a compact crossover SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It primarily came with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. While some appreciate its compact size and available features, common criticisms include its lackluster acceleration, engine noise, and sometimes outdated interior. Transmission options were either a 5-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT).

**Engine**

**2.0L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warning lights, blue smoke from the exhaust, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels frequently and topping off as needed. A compression test and leak-down test can help determine the source of the oil consumption. If the issue is worn piston rings or valve stem seals, an engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported stalling or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the issue can involve checking the fuel system (fuel pump, fuel injectors), ignition system (spark plugs, ignition coils), and sensors (mass airflow sensor, oxygen sensor). Updating the engine control unit (ECU) software may also resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT can experience premature failure, exhibiting symptoms such as slipping, shuddering, delayed engagement, or complete loss of power. Warning lights, such as the "Service Engine Soon" light, may illuminate.
    *   Solution: CVT fluid changes at recommended intervals can help prevent failures. If the transmission fails, replacement is often the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Shuddering/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported shuddering or jerking during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can be caused by worn CVT belt or other internal component issues.
    *   Solution: Performing a CVT fluid flush and refill may temporarily alleviate the problem, but it often returns. Replacement of the CVT may be the only long-term solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid change, $3,000 - $5,000+ for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension components such as struts, shocks, and control arm bushings. This can lead to a rough ride, poor handling, and unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn suspension components with new ones.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced excessive battery drain, resulting in difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws by using a multimeter to measure current draw while the vehicle is off. Potential sources of parasitic draw include aftermarket accessories, faulty modules, and a failing alternator. Replacing the battery with a new one is recommended after fixing the source of the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement, $100 - $1,000+ for diagnosing and fixing parasitic draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty TPMS Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors may fail prematurely, triggering the TPMS warning light even when tire pressure is normal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty TPMS sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicles driven in areas with harsh winters are prone to rusting of the undercarriage, suspension components, and body panels.
    * Solution: Applying rustproofing to the undercarriage and body panels. Repair or replace any rusted components
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio or infotainment system may experience glitches, such as freezing, failing to power on, or losing Bluetooth connectivity.
    *   Solution: Updating the software may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, replacing the head unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software update, $200 - $1,000+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ineffective or non-functional air conditioning is a common complaint. This can be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a clogged condenser.
    *   Solution: Recharge the A/C system with refrigerant. If the problem persists, inspect and replace faulty components such as the compressor, condenser, or evaporator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport has several reported issues spanning various vehicle systems. The most significant concerns revolve around the CVT transmission, which can be prone to premature failure, resulting in costly repairs. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption are also a concern, as are electrical problems. Suspension components may also wear out quickly. While some problems are relatively minor, others, such as transmission or engine failures, can be very expensive to repair.
