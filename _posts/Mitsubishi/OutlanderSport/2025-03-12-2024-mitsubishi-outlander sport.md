The 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It comes equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While the Outlander Sport offers a comfortable ride and user-friendly infotainment system, some drivers find the acceleration lacking and the interior materials basic. Common criticisms include the engine's lack of power for highway driving and the CVT's tendency to drone under heavy acceleration.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and consulting with a Mitsubishi technician to determine the cause and potential repair options, such as replacing piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine misfires. Symptoms may include rough idling, reduced power, poor fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes related to misfires are also expected.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is required to determine the cause. It may be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause and components requiring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **CVT Jerking or Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing jerking or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This can feel like a lag or a sudden surge in power delivery.
    *   Solution: Software updates or transmission control module (TCM) recalibration may improve the issue. In severe cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for software updates; $3,000 - $5,000+ for CVT replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported excessive noise (whining) from the CVT under acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid change can resolve the issue, however, more severe instances may require the CVT to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid change, $3,000-$5,000 for rebuild or replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other connected features.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or updating the software may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) to $500 - $1,500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera intermittently fails to display an image, showing a black screen or distorted video. This can compromise safety during reversing.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. If the wiring is intact, the camera itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on whether it's a wiring issue or camera replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting Around Hatchback**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature rust formation around the rear hatch, especially near the license plate area.
    *   Solution: Repair the rust by sanding, priming, and repainting. Apply rust inhibitor and wax to protect the area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the rust damage and the body shop's labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Reflection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive glare from the dashboard reflecting onto the windshield, particularly on sunny days, obstructing the driver's view.
    *   Solution: Using a dashboard cover or applying an anti-glare film to the windshield can reduce the reflection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100 (for dashboard cover or anti-glare film)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area, especially when driving on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying and securing the source of the rattle. This may involve tightening loose screws, applying felt tape to contact points, or replacing worn clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY fix) to $100 - $300+ (if a professional mechanic is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, while generally reliable, experiences some common issues. The most concerning issues relate to the engine (oil consumption, misfires) and transmission (jerking, whining), which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues, such as infotainment glitches and backup camera failures, are also reported. Interior rattles and exterior rust are potential annoyances but are less critical. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection.
