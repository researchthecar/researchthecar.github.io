The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While owners appreciate its value and ease of use, common criticisms include the engine's lackluster performance and the CVT's droning sound. An optional 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is also available on higher trims.

**Engine**

**2.0L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, engine knocking, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks. If consumption is excessive, a dealer can perform an oil consumption test. Potential fixes include replacing valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the issue and repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Shudder/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced shuddering or jerking during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This is often attributed to issues within the CVT.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change may alleviate the issue in some cases. More severe cases may require CVT replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or droning sound emanating from the CVT, especially during acceleration.
    *   Solution: While some CVT noise is normal, excessive whining can indicate wear or damage. A fluid change might help, but a failing CVT may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (CVT replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of early wear or failure of components like struts, shocks, and sway bar links, leading to poor handling, noise over bumps, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn suspension components with OEM or aftermarket parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system intermittently freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and phone connectivity.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve the issue. In some cases, replacing the head unit is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery drains unexpectedly, leaving vehicle unable to start.
    * Solution: Replacing the battery or fixing parasitic draw.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on the issue and repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport experiences a range of issues, with the most concerning relating to the CVT's reliability. While some problems can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes like fluid changes, more serious issues like CVT or engine failure can lead to significant repair costs. Owners should be vigilant about monitoring oil levels, and being aware of any unusual sounds or behaviors from the CVT. The infotainment system's glitches are a nuisance, but typically less costly to resolve than mechanical problems.
