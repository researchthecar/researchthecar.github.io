The 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a compact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It was primarily offered with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While some owners appreciate its value and maneuverability, common criticisms include lackluster acceleration, a noisy engine, and a somewhat basic interior. A 2.4-liter inline-4 producing 168 horsepower was also available.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, leading to the need for frequent oil top-offs. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, engine knocking or ticking noises, and blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, possible solutions range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive engine repairs such as piston ring replacement or even a complete engine overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV valve) to $3,000+ (engine overhaul)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the engine stalls intermittently, especially at lower speeds or when idling. This can be a safety concern, particularly in traffic.
    *   Solution: Common causes include a faulty mass airflow (MAF) sensor, a dirty throttle body, or issues with the fuel delivery system. Diagnosis is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported complete CVT failure, characterized by a loss of power, inability to accelerate, loud whining noises, or jerky movements.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT is often the only viable solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Hesitation and Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported hesitation upon acceleration or jerking during normal driving conditions. The CVT transmission doesn't shift like a normal transmission so this may be considered normal for this type of transmission.
    *   Solution: A CVT fluid change might improve the situation, but may not resolve it entirely. Some have found success with a CVT software update, if available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid change), $100 - $200+ (software update, if available)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of struts and shocks can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased stopping distances.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts and shocks is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (parts and labor for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rear suspension sag, especially when carrying passengers or cargo.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear springs might be necessary. Some owners have also installed aftermarket spacers to lift the rear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (spring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rapid battery drain, especially when the vehicle is not driven for a few days. This can lead to difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: The cause can range from a parasitic drain to a failing alternator or a defective battery. A thorough diagnostic test is needed to identify the source of the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (battery replacement) to $500+ (alternator replacement or parasitic draw repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory infotainment system can experience issues such as freezing, crashing, or failure to connect to Bluetooth devices.
    *   Solution: Simple fixes may involve resetting the system or updating the software (if available). In more severe cases, the infotainment system might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) to $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners, particularly in regions with harsh winters and road salt, have reported premature rust on the undercarriage and body panels.
    *   Solution: Rust repair can range from localized sanding and painting to more extensive panel replacement. Applying rust protection treatments can help prevent further corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system can fail prematurely, blowing warm air instead of cold. Common causes include a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Repairing the air conditioning system typically involves diagnosing the source of the problem and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (recharge) to $1,000+ (compressor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport presents a mixed bag of potential issues. The most concerning and potentially costly problems revolve around the CVT transmission, which can suffer from hesitation, jerking, and even complete failure. Excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L engine is also a prevalent issue to watch out for. Other areas of concern include suspension wear, electrical problems like battery drain, and potential rust formation. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, major issues like CVT replacement or engine overhaul can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, especially focusing on the transmission's condition.
