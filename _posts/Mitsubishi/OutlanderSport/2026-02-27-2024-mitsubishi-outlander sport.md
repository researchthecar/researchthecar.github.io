### Summary Verdict
The 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is positioned as an affordable and practical compact SUV. Its reliability is generally considered average for its class, with the powertrain (both engine options) showing good durability. The main areas of concern tend to be the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), which can occasionally exhibit hesitation or jerking, and some electrical components, particularly the infotainment system's connectivity and potential battery issues.
