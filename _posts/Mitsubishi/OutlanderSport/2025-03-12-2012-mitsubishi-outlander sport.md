The 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a compact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). While owners appreciate its nimble handling and value, common criticisms include its lackluster acceleration, engine noise, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.0L 4-Cylinder**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. It may involve replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or, in severe cases, a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported engine misfires leading to rough idling, poor acceleration, and the check engine light illuminating. This can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the faulty component, followed by replacement of the affected parts (spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**
* **CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature CVT failure is a recurring complaint. Symptoms include hesitation, slipping, shuddering, jerking, or complete loss of power. This often occurs at relatively low mileage.
    * Solution: Replacing the CVT is usually the only viable solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Whining Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: A distinct whining noise from the transmission, especially during acceleration, is a common symptom indicating internal wear or damage within the CVT.
    * Solution: In some cases, a fluid flush and replacement might temporarily alleviate the noise. However, the underlying issue usually persists and requires a CVT replacement eventually.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 (fluid flush) / $3,000 - $5,000+ (replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of suspension components, particularly the struts, shocks, and sway bar links. This results in a bouncy ride, poor handling, and clunking noises over bumps.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components, often in pairs (e.g., both front struts or both rear shocks).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience unexplained battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days. This can be attributed to a parasitic drain caused by a faulty electrical component or wiring issue.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair the parasitic drain. This may involve testing individual circuits to identify the source of the drain and replacing the faulty component or repairing damaged wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Radio/Navigation System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the radio/navigation system, including issues with the display screen, audio output, and navigation functions.
    * Solution: Replacing the radio/navigation unit or repairing faulty wiring connections.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on the Frame**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive rust on the frame rails.
    * Solution: Frame repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Airbag Light Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners reported that the airbag light would come on for no reason. Usually this would happen if the seat was adjusted or if there was weight put onto it.
    * Solution: Have the dealer recalibrate or replace the Occupancy Classification System (OCS) Module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport presents several potential issues, with the most serious concerns relating to premature CVT failure and potential engine problems like excessive oil consumption. Electrical glitches and suspension wear are also commonly reported. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to address, others can result in significant repair costs.
