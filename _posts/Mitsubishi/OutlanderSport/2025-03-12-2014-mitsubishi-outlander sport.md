The 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It came standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciated its compact size for city driving and its fuel economy, while common complaints revolved around lackluster acceleration and engine noise.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms may include the need to add oil more frequently than expected, blue exhaust smoke, and potential engine damage if oil levels are not maintained.
    *   Solution: Possible solutions include replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or, in severe cases, the entire engine. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idle/Stalling**
  * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience rough idling or the engine stalling, especially at low speeds or when stopped. This can be accompanied by hesitation during acceleration.
  * Solution: Cleaning or replacing the mass airflow sensor (MAF), throttle body, or idle air control valve may resolve the issue. Checking for vacuum leaks is also essential.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ depending on the parts and labor required.
  * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure/Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT transmission in some 2014 Outlander Sports has been reported to fail prematurely, exhibiting symptoms such as shuddering, hesitation, slipping, or complete loss of power. In some instances the shuddering may occur under light acceleration when the vehicle is cold.
    *   Solution: In many cases, the CVT requires replacement. A software update may address some minor issues, but major failures typically necessitate a new or rebuilt transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for replacement or rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear of suspension components, especially ball joints and sway bar links, can lead to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and sway bar links. A wheel alignment is recommended after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per component, plus alignment costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, leaving them with a dead battery, especially after short periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Identifying the parasitic draw and addressing the faulty component causing the drain. This may involve testing the alternator, starter, and other electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: TPMS sensors failing or providing inaccurate readings. The TPMS light might illuminate even when tire pressures are correct, or fail to warn of low pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty TPMS sensors. Ensure proper programming of new sensors to the vehicle's system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per sensor, including programming.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard material, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is the only permanent solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on labor and part availability.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport has several potential issues owners should be aware of. The most significant and costly is the potential for CVT transmission failure. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption and electrical issues like battery drain can also occur. Suspension wear and dashboard cracking are also common. The severity of these problems can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars.
