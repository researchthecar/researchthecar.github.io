The 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. Two engine options were available: a 2.0L inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque and a 2.4L inline-4 engine introduced later in the model year producing 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (limited availability) and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the vehicle's gas mileage and maneuverability, while common complaints revolve around its underpowered feel, especially when accelerating or climbing hills, and the CVT's performance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if left unchecked.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels and addressing any leaks. If the consumption is excessive, a compression test and leak-down test can help determine the cause. In some cases, piston ring replacement or engine rebuild may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall while driving, especially at low speeds or when idling. This can be dangerous in traffic.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the faulty sensor, fuel pump, or ignition system component is necessary to resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Inline-4**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

* **Hesitation/Lack of Power**
    * Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is the CVT's tendency to hesitate or feel underpowered, especially during acceleration or when climbing hills. The transmission may also "hunt" for the right gear ratio, leading to erratic performance.
    * Solution: Software updates can sometimes improve CVT performance. In some cases, CVT replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software Update) - $4,000+ (CVT Replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **CVT Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature failure of the CVT is another reported issue. Symptoms include slipping, shuddering, unusual noises, and the inability to accelerate.
    * Solution: CVT replacement is typically required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the vehicle sits unused for a few days.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of parasitic drain, repair or replacement of faulty components (e.g., alternator, starter, or accessory circuits), battery replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Key Fob Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Key fobs may stop working or have intermittent issues, requiring reprogramming or replacement.
    * Solution: Battery replacement in the fob, reprogramming of the fob, or replacement of the fob or receiver.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Dashboard replacement is the most common solution. Dashboard covers can also be used as a preventative measure.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport presents several potential issues, with the most concerning being CVT problems and potential oil consumption with the 2.0L engine. Electrical issues like battery drain and key fob malfunctions are also present. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs requiring significant investment. Addressing these issues promptly can prevent further damage and ensure the vehicle's long-term reliability.
