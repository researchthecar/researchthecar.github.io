The 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a compact crossover SUV known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It came standard with a 2.0L 4-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Some owners appreciate its compact size and maneuverability, while others find its engine underpowered and the interior materials cheap. Common complaints often revolve around the CVT transmission, engine performance, and electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**2.0L 4-Cylinder**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 2.0L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust (especially on startup), and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The first solution should be switching to a heavier-weight oil. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls randomly, especially at low speeds or when idling. This can be dangerous in traffic.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Mass Airflow Sensor or cleaning the throttle body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CVT is known to fail prematurely. Symptoms include shuddering during acceleration, slipping, delayed engagement, and a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: CVT replacement. A software update may resolve some minor issues, but usually a full replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shuddering and Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or jerking during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can feel like the transmission is struggling to find the right gear (even though a CVT doesn't have traditional gears).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT fluid, or a complete transmission replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty TPMS Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors fail prematurely, causing the TPMS light to illuminate even when tire pressures are correct.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty TPMS sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Head Unit Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory radio or head unit may malfunction, exhibiting issues such as a blank screen, no sound, or inability to connect to Bluetooth.
    *   Solution: Replacing the radio/head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust may develop along the seams and on the underbody, especially in regions with harsh winter weather.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Airbag warning light is illuminated due to a faulty sensor or connection.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor or repairing the connection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport has some significant issues to be aware of. The most concerning is the potential for premature CVT failure, which can be very expensive to repair. Engine issues, such as excessive oil consumption, can also lead to costly repairs. Electrical problems, like faulty TPMS sensors and radio failures, are less severe but can still be annoying. Overall, the severity of potential problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. A thorough inspection, including checking the CVT fluid condition and history of oil consumption, is highly recommended before purchasing a used 2011 Outlander Sport.
