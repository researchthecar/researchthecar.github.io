The 2021 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. It features a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While some owners appreciate its compact size and value, common complaints include the engine's lack of power, the CVT's performance, and the overall dated interior.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that their 2.0L engines consume an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, visible blue smoke from the exhaust, or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The solution varies depending on the severity. It may involve replacing valve stem seals, piston rings, or in extreme cases, replacing the entire engine. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source of the oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A few owners have reported instances of the engine stalling or hesitating, especially when accelerating from a stop or at low speeds. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the issue may involve checking the mass airflow sensor, throttle body, fuel injectors, and spark plugs. It could also be related to a software issue in the engine control unit (ECU) requiring a reflash.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT**

*   **CVT Slippage/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the CVT transmission experiencing slippage, jerking, or hesitation during acceleration. This can be more noticeable at higher speeds or when climbing hills.
    *   Solution: A fluid change may resolve the issue in some cases. In more severe instances, the CVT unit may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CVT Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable whining or buzzing noise coming from the transmission area, particularly during acceleration, is a common complaint. This is often attributed to the nature of the CVT design. However, excessive noise can indicate a problem.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a CVT fluid change can help reduce the noise. If the noise is excessive or accompanied by other symptoms, the CVT may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Suspension Component Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of suspension components such as ball joints, tie rod ends, and struts/shocks. This can lead to excessive noise, vibrations, and poor handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn components is the usual fix. It's also recommended to have a wheel alignment performed after replacing any suspension parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced glitches, freezes, or unresponsiveness with the infotainment system. This may include issues with the touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, or navigation.
    *   Solution: Trying a system reset, updating the software, or, in some cases, replacing the infotainment unit may resolve this.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of the battery draining prematurely, especially if the vehicle is left parked for extended periods, are not uncommon.
    *   Solution: Testing the battery and charging system, checking for parasitic draws, and replacing the battery if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or creaking noises emanating from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and tightening or replacing the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, while affordable, has some common issues. Engine problems, such as excessive oil consumption, and transmission concerns, like CVT slippage, can be costly to repair, potentially reaching several thousand dollars. Electrical and interior issues are generally less severe but can still be a nuisance. Suspension issues can also lead to more repair costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed to assess the vehicle's condition.
