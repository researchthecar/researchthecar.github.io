The 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is a compact crossover SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. The standard engine is a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission (FWD only) or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). A 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine is also available, producing 168 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, which only came with the CVT. Owners often appreciate the Outlander Sport's value proposition and maneuverability, but some common complaints include the CVT's performance, the engine's lack of power, and the overall interior quality.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible exhaust smoke (blue-ish tint), and engine knocking in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Initially, checking for leaks and performing an oil consumption test. If consumption exceeds acceptable levels, potential fixes range from replacing valve stem seals to piston ring replacement, or in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and the engine check light illuminating are common symptoms reported by owners.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the misfire to determine the cause. This may require replacing faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
