### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mitsubishi L200 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its utilitarian purpose. The diesel engines, while powerful, can be prone to turbocharger issues and, in the larger 3.2L, timing chain wear. Transmission issues are typically related to wear and tear on clutch components in manuals or torque converter problems in automatics. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items, especially under heavy use. Electrical gremlins, such as alternator failure and wiring corrosion, can occur. Rust is a significant concern, especially in certain climates. Overall, with diligent maintenance and attention to reported issues, the L200 remains a capable and dependable pickup.
