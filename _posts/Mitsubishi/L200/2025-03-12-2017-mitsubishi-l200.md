The 2017 Mitsubishi L200, also known as the Triton in some markets, is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness, practicality, and off-road capabilities. Engine options for the 2017 model year typically included a 2.4-liter diesel engine producing around 180 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options usually consisted of a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the L200's reliability, robust build, and value for money. Common complaints often involve interior quality, ride comfort on rough roads, and engine noise.

**Engine**

**2.4L Diesel**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between services. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be observed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the piston rings might be necessary. Addressing any potential turbocharger oil leaks is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogging, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and warning lights. This can be exacerbated by frequent short journeys.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration, or replacement if regeneration is not possible. Modifying driving habits to include longer journeys can help prevent future clogging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clogging of the EGR valve can cause rough idling, poor acceleration, and increased emissions.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh gear changes or a noticeable delay when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body inspection and repair or replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, particularly when accelerating in higher gears, can indicate a worn clutch disc.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension sagging, especially when carrying heavy loads. This can affect ride height and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear leaf springs with upgraded or heavy-duty versions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises and imprecise handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn bushings with higher-quality aftermarket options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days of being parked.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to determine what circuit is drawing current while the vehicle is off. Repair the circuit or replace the faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failure of the central locking system, affecting one or more doors.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair wiring harnesses and door lock actuators. Replacing faulty actuators may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion Issues (Specific Regions)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rust, particularly in areas exposed to harsh weather conditions or road salt. This is more location-dependent than a widespread issue.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, prevention treatments, and regular washing/waxing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or non-existent airflow from the air conditioning system, often linked to compressor failure or refrigerant leaks.
    *   Solution: Repairing leaks, replacing the compressor, and recharging the system.

**Summary**

The 2017 Mitsubishi L200, while generally considered reliable, does have a few potential problem areas. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and DPF problems in the 2.4L diesel can be costly. Transmission issues, while less common, also can cause significant expense, so it is important to maintain the transmission. Suspension wear is typical for a truck of this type but should be inspected. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
