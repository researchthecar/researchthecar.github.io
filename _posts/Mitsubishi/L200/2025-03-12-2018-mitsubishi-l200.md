The 2018 Mitsubishi L200 (also known as the Triton in some markets) is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and practicality. Engine options for this model year typically included a 2.4L Diesel engine, which produces around 180 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. Some owners praise the L200 for its off-road capabilities and reliability, while common complaints often revolve around ride comfort, interior quality, and engine noise.

**Engine**

**2.4L Diesel**

*   **Excessive Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, leading to increased fuel consumption and potential engine damage if not completed properly. Some owners report the DPF light illuminating more often than expected.
    *   Solution: Ensure regular long drives at higher speeds to allow for passive DPF regeneration. If the problem persists, a forced DPF regeneration by a qualified mechanic may be necessary. In severe cases, DPF replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A clogged or faulty EGR valve can cause rough idling, reduced power, and the engine management light to illuminate.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Jerky or abrupt gear changes, particularly between lower gears, are occasionally reported by owners.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush may alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, inspection of the valve body and solenoids is recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noises emanating from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This is a common complaint related to the leaf spring design.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring bushings and shims. In some cases, replacement of the bushings or entire leaf spring assembly may be required if wear is excessive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report issues with various sensors (e.g., oxygen sensors, ABS sensors) failing prematurely, leading to warning lights on the dashboard and potential performance issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Faulty Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the infotainment system, including freezing, slow response times, and connectivity problems (e.g., Bluetooth).
    *   Solution: Software update (if available) or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Mitsubishi L200, while generally reliable, does have a few common issues. Engine problems related to the DPF and EGR system are relatively prevalent, but not catastrophic. Owners should be aware of potential suspension noises and electrical sensor failures. While the repairs generally aren't overly expensive, the frequency of some issues like DPF regeneration could be annoying.
