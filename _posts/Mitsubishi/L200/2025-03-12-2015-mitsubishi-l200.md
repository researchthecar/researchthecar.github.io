The 2015 Mitsubishi L200 (also known as the Triton in some markets) is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and versatility. Engine options typically included a 2.5-liter diesel engine. Depending on the specific market and trim level, transmission options included a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, and a 5-speed automatic. Power output for the 2.5-liter diesel varied depending on the tune but generally produced around 136-178 hp and 232-295 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the L200's off-road capabilities and practicality, but some common complaints revolve around ride comfort, interior quality, and potential reliability issues as the vehicle ages.

**Summary**

The 2015 Mitsubishi L200 can suffer from several issues as it ages, including engine oil consumption, turbocharger problems, and suspension wear. Electrical problems with the central locking system and alternator are also common. Rust, particularly in coastal areas, is another potential concern. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively inexpensive fixes (e.g., bushing replacement) to more costly repairs (e.g., engine rebuild, transmission overhaul, or rust repair). Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when making their purchase decision.
