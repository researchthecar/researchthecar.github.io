### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mitsubishi L200 demonstrates good overall reliability, especially concerning its core powertrain. The diesel engines, while generally robust, can experience issues like turbocharger problems or EGR valve malfunctions, particularly with higher mileage or less diligent maintenance. Transmission reliability is decent, with manual clutches and automatic torque converters being the most common wear items or potential failure points. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs and ball joints, can require attention due to the vehicle's utility and load-carrying nature. Electrical issues like alternator failure are not uncommon as the vehicle ages. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, the L200 is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be aware of these specific potential issues and factor in maintenance costs accordingly.
