### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Mitsubishi L200 demonstrates a solid reliability record, particularly with its robust diesel powertrains. While common issues like turbocharger problems and glow plug failures can occur with the 2.4L and 2.5L engines, they are often manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. Transmission reliability is generally good, though older automatic variants might see torque converter issues. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can be a point of concern under heavy load or rough usage. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor faults, are not uncommon but are typically addressable. Overall, the L200 is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential engine and suspension wear points.
