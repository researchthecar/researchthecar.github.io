The 2019 Mitsubishi L200, also known as the Triton in some markets, is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and practicality. A common engine option is the 2.4-liter 4N15 turbodiesel, producing around 178 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included a 2.5-liter diesel and a 2.4-liter gasoline engine depending on the market. Transmission options are typically a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the L200's off-road capabilities and value for money, but some have noted concerns about the ride quality and interior fit and finish.

**Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between services. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be observed.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. Consult with a mechanic to check for potential causes such as worn piston rings or valve stem seals.
