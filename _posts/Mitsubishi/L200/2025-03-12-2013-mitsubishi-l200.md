The 2013 Mitsubishi L200 (also known as the Triton in some markets) is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and reliability, although it isn't without its common issues. Engine options for the 2013 L200 include a 2.5-liter turbocharged diesel engine, which is the most common configuration and produces around 175 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific tune. Other engine options may include a 2.4-liter gasoline engine and a lower-powered version of the 2.5-liter diesel. Transmission options typically consist of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic, although a 5-speed automatic may be available depending on the market. Owners often praise the L200 for its off-road capability and affordability, while common complaints revolve around ride comfort and some specific mechanical issues.
