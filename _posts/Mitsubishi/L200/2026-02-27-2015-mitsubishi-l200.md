### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mitsubishi L200 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly its core mechanical components like the diesel engines and robust chassis. Common issues tend to revolve around wear items that can be exacerbated by heavy use or specific environmental conditions, such as turbocharger wear, DPF clogging in diesel variants, and potential rust on body panels. Suspension components like leaf springs and shock absorbers can also require attention, especially if the vehicle is frequently used for towing or off-roading. Electrical issues, while not pervasive, can include alternator failure or wiring harness corrosion. With diligent maintenance, especially concerning fluid changes and DPF regeneration cycles, the L200 remains a dependable workhorse.
