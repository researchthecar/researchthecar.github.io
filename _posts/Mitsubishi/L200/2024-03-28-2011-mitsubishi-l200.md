**Introduction:** The 2011 Mitsubishi L200 is a mid-size pickup truck available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 2.5-liter diesel engine that produces 175 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque.

Drivers appreciate the L200's rugged off-road capabilities and spacious interior. However, some owners have reported issues with the vehicle's engine, transmission, and other components.

**Engine**

**2.5-liter Diesel Engine**

* **Oil leaks:** Leaks can occur from the camshaft seal, oil pan gasket, and turbocharger oil feed line. Symptoms include low oil levels and oil spots on the ground. The leaks can be repaired by replacing the faulty seals or gaskets. The estimated cost to fix is $200 - $500+.
* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail due to a lack of lubrication or excessive heat. Symptoms include a loss of power, black smoke from the exhaust, and increased oil consumption. The turbocharger can be replaced to fix the issue, at an estimated cost of $1,000 - $2,000+.

**3.2-liter Diesel Engine**

* **Fuel injector problems:** The fuel injectors can become clogged or damaged, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and increased fuel consumption. The fuel injectors can be cleaned or replaced to fix the issue, at an estimated cost of $200 - $400+ per injector.

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual Transmission**

* **Difficult shifting:** The transmission may become difficult to shift into certain gears, particularly when cold. The issue can be caused by worn synchronizers or linkage components. Replacing the faulty parts can fix the problem, at an estimated cost of $200 - $600+.
* **Grinding noises:** Grinding noises when shifting gears can indicate worn gears or bearings. The transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced to fix the issue, at an estimated cost of $1,000 - $2,500+.

**4-speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Slipping gears:** The transmission may slip out of gear while driving. The issue can be caused by worn clutch plates or a faulty valve body. Repairing the transmission can fix the problem, at an estimated cost of $1,200 - $2,000+.

**5-speed Automatic Transmission**

* **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Leaf spring failure:** The leaf springs can break or sag over time, leading to poor ride quality and handling. The leaf springs can be replaced to fix the issue, at an estimated cost of $300 - $600+ per spring.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator problems:** The alternator can fail to charge the battery, leading to electrical problems and a dead battery. The alternator can be replaced to fix the issue, at an estimated cost of $300 - $600+.
* **Battery drain:** The battery can drain quickly, even when the vehicle is not in use. The issue can be caused by a parasitic drain, such as a faulty electrical component. Identifying and fixing the source of the drain can resolve the problem, at an estimated cost of $100 - $500+.

**Exterior**

* **Rust on the frame:** The frame can develop rust over time, particularly in areas exposed to moisture and salt. Rust can weaken the frame and compromise the vehicle's structural integrity. Treating the rust with a rust inhibitor or replacing the affected parts can help prevent further damage, at an estimated cost of $200 - $1,000+.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard panel peeling:** The dashboard panel can begin to peel or crack over time. Replacing the dashboard can fix the issue, at an estimated cost of $200 - $500+.
* **Climate control issues:** The climate control system may malfunction, leading to problems with heating or cooling the vehicle. Fixing the faulty components or replacing the climate control module can resolve the issue, at an estimated cost of $300 - $700+.

**Summary:** The 2011 Mitsubishi L200 has received mixed reviews from owners. While some appreciate its off-road capabilities and spacious interior, others have reported issues with the vehicle's engine, transmission, and other components. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
