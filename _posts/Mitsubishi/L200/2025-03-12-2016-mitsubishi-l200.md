The 2016 Mitsubishi L200 (also known as the Triton in some markets) is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and practicality. Engine options typically include a 2.4L diesel engine. The 2.4L diesel engine delivers around 178 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate its off-road capabilities and reliability, but some common complaints include issues with the EGR valve, diesel particulate filter (DPF), and suspension components.

**Engine**

**2.4L Diesel**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience a loss of power, rough idling, increased emissions, and the engine warning light may illuminate. This is often caused by carbon buildup within the EGR valve.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. In some cases, a software update may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and the DPF warning light illuminating. Frequent short journeys can exacerbate this issue, as the DPF may not reach the required temperature to regenerate.
    *   Solution: Attempt a forced regeneration of the DPF, either through a diagnostic tool or by driving at a sustained high speed. If the DPF is severely clogged, it may need to be professionally cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (forced regeneration), $500 - $1500+ (DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idling, misfires, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and increased fuel consumption.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace them.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per injector)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or harsh gear changes, especially between certain gears. This may be more noticeable when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change might resolve the issue. If the problem persists, it could indicate internal damage requiring more extensive repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (fluid and filter change), $500 - $2000+ (transmission repair/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in speed, especially under load. This indicates that the clutch is worn and not engaging properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and potentially the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. This can lead to reduced load-carrying capacity and a harsher ride. In severe cases, the leaf springs can crack or break.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used for carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the central locking system. This can affect all doors or just some of them.
    *   Solution: Check the fuses and wiring related to the central locking system. The door lock actuators may also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Alternator**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery not charging properly, dim headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, and eventually, the engine may stall.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Chassis and Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust spots on the chassis, especially in areas prone to salt exposure. Rust can also develop on body panels, particularly around wheel arches and seams.
    *   Solution: Treat and repair rust spots as soon as they are detected. This may involve sanding, applying rust converter, and repainting. In severe cases, body panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on severity and extent of rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard, or use a dashboard cover to conceal the cracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Mitsubishi L200, while generally reliable, faces some common issues. Engine problems, particularly related to the EGR valve and DPF in the 2.4L diesel engine, can lead to performance issues and costly repairs. Suspension issues, such as sagging leaf springs, are also prevalent. Electrical and interior issues are less frequent but can still occur. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with engine and suspension repairs potentially being the most expensive. Regular maintenance and addressing problems early can help mitigate these risks.
