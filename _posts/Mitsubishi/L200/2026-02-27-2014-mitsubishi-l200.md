## Engine

### 2.5L 4D56 Turbo Diesel
**Turbocharger Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of power, excessive smoke, whining noise from the engine bay.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the turbocharger unit. Regular oil changes and ensuring the engine is not shut off immediately after hard driving can help prolong its life.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500

**Glow Plug Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Difficulty starting, especially in cold weather; rough idling.
- **Solution:** Replacement of faulty glow plugs. Ensuring the glow plug system is maintained is crucial for cold starts.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300


### 2.4L 4N15 MIVEC Turbo Diesel
**DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Clogging**
- **Symptoms:** Check engine light, reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, potential stalling.
- **Solution:** Forced regeneration of the DPF, or replacement if severely clogged. Driving habits (frequent short trips) can contribute to clogging.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1200


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Manual Transmission
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the clutch kit (clutch disc, pressure plate, release bearing). Driving style significantly impacts clutch life.
- **Cost:** $500 - $900


### 5-Speed Automatic Transmission
**Torque Converter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering during acceleration, slipping gears, delayed engagement.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of the torque converter. Regular transmission fluid changes are recommended.
- **Cost:** $700 - $1400


## Suspension

### Independent Front Suspension / Leaf Spring Rear
**Worn Ball Joints and Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, poor handling, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and suspension bushings. Regular inspection is advised, especially for vehicles used for heavy hauling or off-roading.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Electrical

### Standard Electrical System
**Alternator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Battery warning light illuminated, dimming headlights, electrical components malfunctioning.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator. Ensure battery terminals are clean and connections are secure.
- **Cost:** $300 - $500


## Exterior

### Body Panels and Trim
**Rust and Corrosion**
- **Symptoms:** Visible rust, particularly on the chassis, wheel arches, and door sills, especially in areas with harsh climates or road salt.
- **Solution:** Rust treatment and repair, underbody rustproofing. Regular washing and waxing can help prevent corrosion.
- **Cost:** $200 - $1000+


## Interior

### Cabin Components
**HVAC System Fan Motor**
- **Symptoms:** No airflow from vents, intermittent fan speed, unusual noises from the dashboard.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blower motor resistor or fan motor. Ensure cabin air filter is clean.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300

### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mitsubishi L200 is generally a reliable workhorse, with its diesel engines being a strong point. The most common issues tend to revolve around wear-and-tear items that are exacerbated by heavy use or specific environmental conditions, such as turbocharger issues on older diesel engines, DPF clogging on newer ones, and suspension components like ball joints and bushings. Rust can also be a concern in certain climates. Electrical issues like alternator failure are not uncommon as the vehicle ages. Transmission reliability is decent, though clutch wear on manuals and torque converter issues on automatics can occur. Overall, with regular maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the L200 should provide dependable service.
