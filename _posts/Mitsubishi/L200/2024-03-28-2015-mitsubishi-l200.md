**Introduction:**

The 2015 Mitsubishi L200 is a mid-size pickup truck offered in both single and double-cab configurations. It features a 2.4-liter turbocharged diesel engine, producing 150 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmission. Known for its ruggedness, reliability, and affordability, the L200 has been praised for its off-road capability but has also drawn criticism for its dated interior and limited safety features.

**Engine**

**2.4-liter Turbocharged Diesel**

* **In-cylinder pressure sensor failure:** The sensor fails, causing the engine to run poorly, experience reduced power, and emit black smoke. Replacement of the sensor is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Fuel injector failure:** The injectors fail, leading to rough idling, misfiring, and poor fuel economy. Injector replacement is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger fails, resulting in decreased engine power and increased fuel consumption. Turbocharger replacement is needed. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

**5-speed Manual**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch wears out prematurely, leading to difficulty shifting gears, slipping, and shuddering. Clutch replacement is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Synchronizer wear:** Synchronizers become worn, causing difficulty shifting gears and grinding noises. Transmission repair or replacement is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

**5-speed Automatic**

* **Valve body failure:** The valve body malfunctions, causing erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and transmission overheating. Valve body replacement is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+
* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter experiences shuddering, resulting in vibrations and rough gear shifts. Torque converter replacement is needed. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
* **Transmission fluid leak:** A leak develops from the transmission pan or lines, causing fluid loss and potential transmission failure. Replacing the leaking part or seal is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension coil spring failure:** The coil springs in the front suspension fail, causing the vehicle to ride low and handle poorly. Spring replacement is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Rear leaf spring breakage:** The leaf springs in the rear suspension break, resulting in reduced load-carrying capacity and poor handling. Leaf spring replacement is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Shock absorber failure:** The shock absorbers wear out, causing reduced ride quality, excessive bouncing, and poor stability. Shock absorber replacement is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Electrical**

* **Battery issues:** The battery fails prematurely or discharges quickly. Battery replacement or charging system diagnostics are required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
* **Alternator failure:** The alternator fails, preventing the battery from charging and causing electrical problems. Alternator replacement is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Starter motor failure:** The starter motor fails, preventing the engine from starting. Starter motor replacement is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Exterior**

* **Body rust:** The body of the vehicle develops rust in areas such as the wheel arches, doors, and tailgate. Rust repair or prevention measures are necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on severity and location

**Interior**

* **Dashboard panel cracking:** The dashboard panel cracks in multiple places, affecting aesthetics. Dashboard replacement is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Door panel rattling:** The door panels rattle or vibrate, causing noise and discomfort. Retightening or replacing door panel components is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
* **Seat adjustment failure:** The driver's seat adjustment mechanism fails, preventing the seat from being properly positioned. Seat mechanism repair or replacement is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

**Summary:**

The 2015 Mitsubishi L200 is a rugged and affordable pickup with off-road capabilities. However, it is not without its issues, which range from minor inconveniences to more serious mechanical problems. Engine issues, such as in-cylinder pressure sensor failure and fuel injector failure, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, like clutch failure and torque converter shudder, can also be expensive. Suspension components, such as coil springs and shock absorbers, wear out and require replacement regularly. Electrical issues, like battery drainage and alternator failure, can interrupt the vehicle's operation. Various interior components, including the dashboard panel and seat adjustment mechanism, have also been reported to have problems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the extent of the damage and the availability of parts.
