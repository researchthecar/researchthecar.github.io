The 2020 Mitsubishi L200 (also known as the Triton in some markets) is a popular pickup truck known for its ruggedness and reliability. It's generally well-liked for its off-road capabilities, practicality, and competitive pricing. However, some owners have reported issues. Engine options typically include a 2.4L Diesel engine (4N15), producing around 178 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, as well as other regional engine variations. Transmission options typically include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some common criticisms include its interior styling and fuel economy compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L Diesel (4N15)**

* **Excessive Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration**
    * Description/Symptoms: The DPF regenerates too frequently, leading to increased fuel consumption and potential issues if regeneration cycles are interrupted. Some owners notice reduced power and a burning smell during regeneration.
    * Solution: Ensure proper driving habits (longer journeys at consistent speeds) to allow for complete regeneration. Check for underlying issues causing excessive soot production, such as faulty injectors or a malfunctioning EGR valve. A forced DPF regeneration by a mechanic might temporarily resolve the issue. Replacing a faulty DPF sensor can also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the solution; sensor replacement is cheaper than DPF replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and the engine management light illuminating.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky gear changes, particularly between certain gears. The transmission might also hesitate before engaging.
    * Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement using the correct Mitsubishi-approved fluid. If the problem persists, it could indicate a problem with the valve body or solenoids.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ (depending on the severity and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable squeaking noise from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring bushings with a silicone-based lubricant. In severe cases, replacing the bushings may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on whether lubrication or replacement is required)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Faulty Air Conditioning Compressor Relay**
    * Description/Symptoms: Air conditioning system not functioning correctly. The compressor may not engage, resulting in a lack of cold air.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty relay.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust near the cargo bed**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming at the seam between the bed and the body of the truck. Rust can also form near the wheel wells.
    * Solution: Sand down the rust and repaint the area. Apply a rust inhibitor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity of the rust)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a restart.
    * Solution: Check for software updates and install them. If the problem persists, a system reset or replacement of the head unit might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (head unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Mitsubishi L200 generally faces manageable issues. The most concerning seem to revolve around the DPF and EGR systems, which can lead to costly repairs if neglected. Transmission issues, while present, are not overwhelmingly common. Suspension and electrical issues are typically minor and easily addressed. It is important to be aware of the potential for rust issues, especially in areas with harsh winters. The cost of repairs can vary widely, but most issues can be resolved without requiring extensive work.
