The 2022 Mitsubishi L200, also known as the Triton in some markets, is a popular pickup truck known for its reliability, off-road capabilities, and practical design. It's typically powered by a 2.4-liter 4N15 turbodiesel engine, producing around 178 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options may be available in certain markets, including a 2.5-liter diesel. Transmission options typically include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the L200's ruggedness, fuel efficiency, and value for money. Common dislikes often revolve around the relatively basic interior and somewhat unrefined ride compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.4L 4N15 Turbodiesel**

*   **Excessive Engine Noise/Rattling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unusual rattling or knocking noises coming from the engine, especially during cold starts or under load. This may indicate issues with the timing chain or related components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic to determine the exact source of the noise. This could involve replacing the timing chain, tensioners, or other related parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, DPF warning light illumination, reduced engine performance, and potential limp mode. This can be caused by driving short distances at low speeds or a faulty DPF sensor.
    *   Solution: Attempt a forced DPF regeneration (either through the vehicle's system or by a mechanic), clean the DPF, or replace the DPF if cleaning is not effective. Addressing underlying issues like faulty sensors or driving habits that contribute to DPF clogging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (cleaning) - $2000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Diesel**
No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky gear changes, especially between certain gears. This may be more noticeable at lower speeds or during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a more in-depth diagnostic inspection of the transmission may be required to identify potential issues with the valve body or other internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid/filter change), $500 - $2000+ (valve body or internal repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**
No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This is a common issue with leaf spring suspensions, particularly in dusty or dirty environments.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the leaf spring interleaf pads with a suitable grease or spray lubricant. Replacing the leaf spring bushings can also help reduce squeaking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (lubrication), $200 - $500+ (bushing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or spontaneously reboots. This may be caused by software glitches or hardware issues.
    *   Solution: Try performing a software update for the infotainment system (if available). If the problem persists, the system may need to be diagnosed and repaired or replaced by a qualified technician.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (ABS, TPMS)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights illuminating on the dashboard indicating a problem with the ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) or TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System). This may be caused by faulty sensors or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is malfunctioning using a diagnostic scan tool. Replace the faulty sensor and ensure proper wiring connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per sensor replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust in Cargo Bed**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming in the cargo bed of the truck, especially in areas prone to water pooling or damage to the bed liner (if equipped).
    * Solution: Clean the affected area and apply rust converter, followed by a protective coating or paint. For more severe rust, professional repair or replacement of the bed may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (DIY repair), $500 - $2000+ (professional repair/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system blows warm air or fails to cool the cabin effectively. This may be caused by a refrigerant leak, compressor failure, or a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Inspect the air conditioning system for leaks and recharge the refrigerant. If necessary, replace the compressor, condenser, or other faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (recharge/leak repair), $300 - $1000+ (compressor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Mitsubishi L200 generally exhibits typical issues for a pickup truck. Engine and transmission issues, while not widespread, can lead to moderate repair costs, particularly related to DPF problems and rough shifting in the automatic transmission. Suspension squeaks are a common annoyance. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and sensors can range from minor to requiring more significant repairs. Rust in the cargo bed is also a concern, particularly in regions with harsh climates. Overall, the severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase.
