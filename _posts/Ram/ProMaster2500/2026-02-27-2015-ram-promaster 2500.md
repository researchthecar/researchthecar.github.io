### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ram ProMaster 2500 demonstrates good overall reliability, especially with its gasoline V6 engine and automatic transmission, which are generally trouble-free. The diesel engine option, while offering better fuel economy, presents a few more potential issues, notably with the Diesel Particulate Filter and EGR valve, which are common to many modern diesel powertrains. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment system quirks, are the most frequently cited non-powertrain concerns. For owners of the diesel variant, proactive maintenance and awareness of DPF regeneration cycles are recommended. Overall, the ProMaster 2500 is a dependable work vehicle, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of major design flaws.
