### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Ram 3500, particularly with the 6.7L Cummins diesel, is a formidable truck. While the powertrain is generally robust, potential owners should be aware of possible issues with fuel injectors and EGR coolers. Transmission reliability is good, but the 68RFE can experience torque converter shudder or overheating under extreme use, and manual transmissions may require clutch replacements over time. Suspension components like leaf springs can be a concern, especially for heavily used trucks. Electrical issues, often related to the BCM, can manifest as various minor annoyances. Overall, the Ram 3500 is a capable and durable vehicle, but proactive maintenance and awareness of these specific potential issues are recommended for long-term ownership.
