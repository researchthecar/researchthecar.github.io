**Summary**
The 2011 Ram 3500, especially with the 6.7L Cummins, is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine and transmission problems, such as EGR cooler and torque converter failures, can be costly to repair. Electrical issues related to the TIPM are also a significant concern. Suspension components also tend to wear out quickly in this vehicle, especially when used under load or in harsh road conditions. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to substantial repair bills.
