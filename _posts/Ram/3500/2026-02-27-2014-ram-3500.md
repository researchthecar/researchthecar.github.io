### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ram 3500 is generally a reliable heavy-duty truck, especially when equipped with the 6.4L HEMI V8. The 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel, while powerful, can be prone to issues with fuel injectors and the EGR system, which are common in many diesel engines of this era. Transmission reliability is good, though the 6-speed automatic may occasionally exhibit torque converter shudder. Electrical components like the alternator and various sensors are the most frequently reported non-powertrain issues. Overall, with proper maintenance, the Ram 3500 should provide dependable service, but potential buyers of the diesel variant should be aware of the specific powertrain concerns.
