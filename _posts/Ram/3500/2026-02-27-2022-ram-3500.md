### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Ram 3500 demonstrates strong overall reliability, particularly with its robust powertrain options. The 6.4L HEMI V8 and the heavy-duty Aisin transmission are noted for their durability with no widespread issues reported. The 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel, while powerful, has some documented concerns related to its emissions control systems (DEF system) and turbocharger longevity, which can incur significant repair costs. Transmission issues on the 68RFE are generally manageable, with torque converter shudder being the most common. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system and sensors, are present but typically resolvable with software updates or component replacement. Exterior and interior components are generally sound, with minor issues like tailgate latches and HVAC blower motors being the most frequently cited. For buyers prioritizing a heavy-duty truck with excellent towing and hauling capabilities, the Ram 3500 is a solid choice, with the diesel engine requiring closer attention to its emissions-related maintenance and potential repairs.
