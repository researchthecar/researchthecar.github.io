# 2019 Ram 700

### Overview
The 2019 Ram 700, a compact pickup truck primarily sold in Latin America, is generally considered a utilitarian and robust vehicle. It's designed for work and often subjected to demanding conditions. Reliability data suggests a solid performance for its class, with most reported issues being minor or related to specific component failures rather than widespread systemic problems. Owners often praise its durability and low running costs. However, like any vehicle, certain components can experience issues over time, particularly those related to its powertrain and electrical systems, though these are not typically indicative of a flawed design but rather normal wear and tear in a work-oriented vehicle.
