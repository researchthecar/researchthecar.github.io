### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ram 2500, particularly with the 6.7L Cummins diesel engine, demonstrates solid overall reliability for its class. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the emissions system (EGR cooler) and the turbocharger on the diesel variants, which can incur significant repair costs. The automatic transmission (68RFE) associated with the diesel can also experience issues like torque converter shudder or overheating if not properly maintained. Electrical gremlins, specifically with the TIPM, are a notable potential failure point across the model range. The gasoline HEMI engines and manual transmissions are generally considered more straightforward and less prone to major technical faults. Regular maintenance, especially for the diesel powertrain and transmission, is crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring the truck's long-term durability.
