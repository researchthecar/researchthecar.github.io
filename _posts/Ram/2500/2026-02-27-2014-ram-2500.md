### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ram 2500, particularly with the 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel engine, demonstrates good overall reliability for a heavy-duty truck. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with fuel injectors, EGR coolers, and the Diesel Particulate Filter, which are common to many diesel powertrains of this era and can be costly to repair. The 68RFE automatic transmission may experience torque converter shudder or overheating issues. Electrical system glitches, such as trailer brake controller problems and sensor failures, are also noted. The gasoline 6.4L HEMI V8 and the G56 manual transmission appear to be more trouble-free. Suspension, exterior, and interior components generally do not present widespread reliability concerns beyond normal wear and tear.
