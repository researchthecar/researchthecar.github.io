### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Ram 2500 demonstrates solid reliability, especially with its gasoline HEMI V8 engine and standard transmissions. The Cummins diesel engine, while powerful, has a few documented issues primarily related to its emissions control system (DEF) and turbocharger performance, which can incur moderate repair costs. The optional auto-leveling air suspension is a convenience feature that, when it fails, can lead to significant repair expenses. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and trailer brake controller, are present but generally manageable with software updates or component replacement. Overall, the Ram 2500 is a dependable heavy-duty truck, with most potential issues concentrated in its more complex optional systems.
