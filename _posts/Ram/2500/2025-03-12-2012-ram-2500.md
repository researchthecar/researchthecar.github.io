Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic for the gasoline engines and a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic for the diesel. Owners often praise the Ram 2500 for its powerful engine options and comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck. Common dislikes include the fuel economy, particularly with the gasoline engines, and some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping sound emanating from the engine, especially when cold. It's often attributed to worn or collapsed hydraulic lifters, exhaust manifold leaks, or piston slap.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is crucial to pinpoint the source. Lifter replacement, manifold repair/replacement, or in severe cases, engine rebuild/replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks, reduced performance, and increased engine noise.
    *   Solution: Replacement of broken bolts and possibly the exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.4L Hemi V8**
No Issues Found

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks or leaks in the EGR cooler, leading to coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure (Primarily 2019+ models but can occur due to cross-contamination or aftermarket parts on older trucks)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catastrophic failure of the CP4 high-pressure fuel pump, contaminating the entire fuel system with metal shavings. Results in rough running, no start condition, and extensive damage.
    *   Solution: Complete fuel system replacement, including the fuel pump, injectors, fuel rails, and fuel lines. Installation of a CP3 conversion kit (replacing the CP4 with a more reliable CP3 pump) is a common preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+

**Summary**

The 2012 Ram 2500 can be a reliable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine issues such as "Hemi tick" and EGR cooler failures are common, and electrical problems with the TIPM can also occur. Suspension components like ball joints and track bar bushings are prone to wear, potentially causing expensive repairs. Interior and exterior issues such as dashboard cracking and rust are also something to consider. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, but it's best to inspect the vehicle carefully before purchasing and to stay on top of routine maintenance.
