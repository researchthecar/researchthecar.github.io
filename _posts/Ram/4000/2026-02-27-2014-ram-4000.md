### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ram 4000, particularly with the 6.7L Cummins engine, is generally considered a durable workhorse. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as EGR cooler failures and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. Transmission reliability is decent, but the 68RFE automatic can experience torque converter issues and overheating, especially under heavy use. Manual transmissions are more straightforward but clutch wear is a normal maintenance item. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, can experience issues due to the truck's intended heavy-duty application. Electrical system components like the alternator are also potential failure points. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these specific potential issues, the Ram 4000 can provide reliable service.
