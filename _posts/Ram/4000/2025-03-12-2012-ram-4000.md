The 2012 Ram 4000 is a heavy-duty chassis cab truck designed for commercial applications. While it shares many components with the Ram 3500, it's often configured for specific work purposes and thus can exhibit different wear patterns. Engine options typically included a 5.7L HEMI V8 (around 383 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-6 (around 350 hp and 650-800 lb-ft of torque depending on the configuration). Available transmissions were generally a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Ram 4000's robust build and towing capacity, but common complaints revolve around fuel economy and the higher maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty trucks.

**Engine**

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **Hemi Tick (Exhaust Manifold Bolts)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking sound, especially when the engine is cold. Often caused by broken exhaust manifold bolts, leading to exhaust leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace broken exhaust manifold bolts. In some cases, the manifold itself may be warped and require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the extent of the damage and if the manifold needs replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft and Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, loss of power, and a ticking or knocking noise from the engine bay. This is often due to worn or failed camshaft lobes and lifters, a common issue in some HEMI engines.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft, lifters, and potentially other valvetrain components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, and the "check engine" light illuminating. This is often due to a clogged or malfunctioning DPF, which is responsible for trapping soot from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF, replacement of the DPF, or cleaning the DPF (depending on the severity of the clogging).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (DPF replacement is the most expensive option)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and unusual turbocharger noises (whining or screeching). Turbocharger failures can occur due to oil starvation, contamination, or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Can also manifest as slipping or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. May also require flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, and potentially getting stuck in a single gear. This is often due to wear or failure of the valve body, which controls fluid flow within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose or wandering steering, clunking noises from the front end, and uneven tire wear. Heavy-duty use can accelerate wear on ball joints and tie rod ends.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on how many components need replacement and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height in the rear, a harsh or bouncy ride, and potential cracking or breakage of the leaf springs. Common in trucks that are frequently used for heavy hauling or towing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical malfunctions, including stalling, non-starting, intermittent operation of lights and accessories, and issues with fuel pump relay.
    *   Solution: TIPM replacement or repair (if possible).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Chafing/Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, sensors malfunctioning, or difficulty starting. This is often due to chafing or corrosion of wiring harnesses, particularly in areas exposed to the elements.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of affected wiring harnesses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts. This is more prevalent in areas with harsh winters and road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and rustproofing the affected areas. In severe cases, component replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Ram 4000, while a capable work truck, can suffer from some notable issues. Engine problems, particularly with the HEMI's valvetrain and the Cummins' emissions system, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical malfunctions also contribute to the potential ownership expenses. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major repairs, with costs varying accordingly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and be prepared for the higher upkeep expenses typically associated with heavy-duty trucks.
