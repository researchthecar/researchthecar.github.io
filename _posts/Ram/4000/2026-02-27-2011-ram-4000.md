### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Ram 4000, particularly with the 6.7L Cummins engine, is a workhorse known for its durability. The most commonly reported issues revolve around the emissions system (EGR cooler) and the turbocharger, which are critical components under heavy use. Transmission issues, while not widespread, can occur, with the 68RFE automatic sometimes exhibiting torque converter shudder or overheating. Manual transmission clutches are subject to wear as expected. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can require attention due to the truck's intended load capacity. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are also noted. Rust can be a concern depending on the climate. Overall, the Ram 4000 is a reliable truck for its intended purpose, but owners should be prepared for potential maintenance related to its heavy-duty nature and emissions equipment.
