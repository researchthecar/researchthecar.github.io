The 2011 Ram 4000, also known as the Ram Chassis Cab, is a heavy-duty work truck designed for commercial applications. For 2011, engine options included a 5.7L HEMI V8 producing 383 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque and a 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-6 producing 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic and a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Ram 4000 for its robust build, towing capacity, and work-ready features. However, some common complaints include fuel economy (especially with the V8), ride quality (inherent in a heavy-duty truck), and certain component failures related to the diesel engine and transmission.

**Engine**

**5.7L HEMI V8**

* **HEMI Tick**
    * Description/Symptoms: A ticking noise emanating from the engine, particularly when cold. Often attributed to exhaust manifold bolts breaking or loosening, creating an exhaust leak.
    * Solution: Replace broken exhaust manifold bolts and/or replace the exhaust manifold gasket. In severe cases, the manifold itself might need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine overheating. The EGR cooler can crack and leak coolant internally.
    * Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, white smoke, and potential fuel dilution of engine oil.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace them.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (68RFE)**

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during shifts, slipping, and difficulty engaging gears. Often accompanied by a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, and overall poor transmission performance.
    * Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Worn Ball Joints**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Can lead to uneven tire wear and poor handling.
    * Solution: Replace worn ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Tie Rod Ends**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering on the road, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace worn tie rod ends.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting problems, fuel pump failures, horn malfunctions, and various other electrical gremlins. This is a common issue across many Chrysler/Dodge/Ram vehicles of this era.
    * Solution: Replace the TIPM. This can sometimes be a costly repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: Some vehicles may have been subject to recall campaigns related to the TIPM, check your VIN.

* **Cabin Fan Only Works On High**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cabin fan only operates on the highest speed setting.
    * Solution: Replace the blower motor resistor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Rocker Panels and Cab Corners**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming along the rocker panels and lower cab corners, especially in areas where road salt is used.
    * Solution: Rust repair and painting. The extent of the repair will depend on the severity of the rust.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard, particularly in vehicles exposed to high temperatures.
    * Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dash cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Ram 4000 is a capable work truck, but like any vehicle, it has potential issues. The diesel engine can be prone to EGR cooler and fuel injector problems, which can be expensive to fix. Transmission issues, particularly with the 6-speed automatic, and electrical issues with the TIPM are also common concerns. Suspension wear and rust are typical for a truck of this age. Severity varies from minor inconveniences to major repairs. Costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Potential buyers should have a mechanic inspect the vehicle thoroughly, especially checking for EGR cooler leaks, injector problems, and transmission health.
