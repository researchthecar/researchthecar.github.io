**Introduction:**

The 2012 Ram 4000 is a full-size pickup truck offered with two engine options: a 5.7L Hemi V8 or a 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-6. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Despite its popularity for its powerful engines and rugged capabilities, the Ram 4000 has faced several issues reported by owners.

**Engine**

**5.7L Hemi V8**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A defective gasket between the intake manifold and cylinder heads can cause coolant and oil leaks, leading to overheating and engine damage. **Replacement and repair of the manifold and gasket:** $500 - $1,000+

* **Cam Phasers Failure:** Faulty cam phasers can cause rough idling, reduced engine power, and increased fuel consumption. **Replacement of cam phasers and associated components:** $1,200 - $2,000+

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging:** Excessive soot buildup in the DPF can result in restricted exhaust flow, loss of power, and fuel efficiency issues. **Regeneration of DPF through additives or manual cleaning:** $200 - $800+

* **Turbocharger Failure:** A malfunctioning turbocharger can lead to reduced air induction, power loss, and black smoke from the exhaust. **Turbocharger replacement:** $2,000 - $4,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** A worn-out transmission pan gasket or seals can cause fluid to leak, leading to slipping gears and decreased transmission performance. **Replacement of gasket or seals:** $300 - $600+

* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Malfunctioning shift solenoids can cause erratic shifting, delayed gear engagement, and transmission shuddering. **Replacement of shift solenoids and transmission fluid flush:** $500 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

* **Front Ball Joint Wear:** Worn ball joints can cause loose steering, clunking noises, and reduced ride stability. **Replacement of ball joints:** $300 - $600+ per joint

* **Leaf Spring Failure:** Broken or sagging leaf springs can affect ride quality, handling, and axle alignment. **Replacement of leaf springs:** $600 - $1,200+ per axle

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** A faulty alternator can lead to charging system issues, battery draining, and electrical system failures. **Replacement of alternator:** $500 - $1,000+

* **Wiring Harness Issues:** Loose or damaged wiring harnesses can cause electrical malfunctions, such as flickering lights, false alarms, or intermittent component failures. **Repair or replacement of wiring harnesses:** $200 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Rust and Corrosion:** Excessive rust and corrosion can occur on body panels, frame, and undercarriage components. **Rust removal and protective coating:** $500 - $2,000+

* **Headlight Lens Fading:** The plastic lenses of headlights can become cloudy and yellowed over time, reducing illumination. **Replacement of headlight assemblies:** $300 - $800+

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** A faulty climate control module can result in inconsistent temperature regulation, blower motor issues, or defrosting problems. **Module replacement and system diagnosis:** $400 - $1,000+

* **Seat Belt Sensor Issues:** Malfunctioning seat belt sensors can trigger false alarms or prevent the airbags from deploying in an accident. **Replacement of seat belt sensors:** $200 - $600+

**Summary:**

The 2012 Ram 4000 has experienced a variety of issues that range from minor inconveniences to major component failures. The most common problems include intake manifold gasket leaks, transmission fluid leaks, and suspension wear. While some issues may be relatively affordable to fix, others can be costly and require extensive repairs. Potential owners should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision.
