### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Ram 4500, equipped with the 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel, generally offers robust performance. However, common issues revolve around the diesel emissions system (DPF and EGR) and potential transmission problems, especially with the 68RFE automatic under heavy use. Manual transmission components like the clutch and flywheel are also subject to wear. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. Suspension components, while heavy-duty, can experience leaf spring issues. Interior components like the blower motor are also noted. Overall, the Ram 4500 is a workhorse, but owners should budget for potential maintenance and repairs related to its demanding operational environment.
