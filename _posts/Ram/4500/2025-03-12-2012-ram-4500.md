**Summary**

The 2012 Ram 4500, while a capable work truck, does have several common issues. Engine problems range from turbocharger and fuel injector issues on the diesel to lifter noise on the Hemi. Transmission issues include torque converter problems and harsh shifting. Electrical problems, particularly with the TIPM, are also prevalent. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out, and rust can be a significant concern, especially in certain climates. Costs for repairs can vary widely, from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. Addressing these issues proactively can help ensure the longevity and reliability of the vehicle.
