**Introduction:**

The 2011 Ram Dakota was a mid-size pickup truck that was offered in various configurations, including regular cab, extended cab, and crew cab body styles. It was available with several engine and transmission options.

The 3.7L V6 engine produced 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, while the 4.7L V8 engine generated 310 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. The 5.7L HEMI V8 engine was the most powerful option, producing 390 horsepower and 407 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices included a 4-speed automatic, a 5-speed automatic, and a 6-speed manual.

The Ram Dakota was praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reasonable towing and hauling capacity. However, it also received criticism for its outdated design, lack of advanced safety features, and subpar fuel economy.
