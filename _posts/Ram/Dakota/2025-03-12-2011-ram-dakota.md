The 2011 Ram Dakota was offered as a mid-size pickup truck aimed at buyers who wanted a smaller, more manageable truck than a full-size model. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 engine producing 177 horsepower and 168 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7L V6 engine rated at 210 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. Some people appreciated the Dakota's smaller size and maneuverability compared to full-size trucks, while others disliked its outdated interior and limited capabilities. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic for the 2.5L, and a 4-speed automatic for the 3.7L.
