### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Ram 1500 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its gasoline V6 and V8 engines and the standard 8-speed automatic transmission. The primary areas of concern are concentrated in the optional 3.0L EcoDiesel engine, which can experience issues with its Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, and the optional Active-Level Four-Corner Air Suspension, which may develop leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and occasional battery drain, are also reported but are not overwhelmingly prevalent. For most buyers, the gasoline powertrain options offer a more trouble-free ownership experience. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning lights are crucial, especially for diesel and air-suspension equipped models.
