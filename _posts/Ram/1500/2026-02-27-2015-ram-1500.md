### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ram 1500 generally presents a solid reliability record for a truck of its age and capability. The Pentastar V6 and HEMI V8 engines are largely dependable, though specific issues like oil leaks and lifter wear (on the HEMI) can occur. The EcoDiesel engine, while offering excellent fuel economy, has a higher propensity for emissions-related problems such as DPF and EGR issues. Transmission reliability is good, with the 8-speed automatic occasionally exhibiting shifting anomalies that often require software updates or fluid services. The 6-speed is known for its robustness. Suspension issues are rare on standard setups but can be more prevalent with the optional air suspension. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect system, are not uncommon. Overall, the 2015 Ram 1500 is a reliable choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific concerns related to the EcoDiesel engine and the 8-speed transmission.
