### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Ram 1500 is a generally reliable truck, especially when equipped with the gasoline V6 or V8 engines and the 8-speed automatic transmission. These configurations show minimal widespread issues. The optional 3.0L EcoDiesel V6, while offering good fuel economy, has a higher propensity for specific issues like EGR cooler leaks and DPF problems, which can be costly to repair. The optional air suspension system can also develop leaks over time. Overall, for buyers prioritizing robust and trouble-free operation, the gasoline powertrain options are recommended. Regular maintenance, particularly for the EcoDiesel, is crucial for long-term dependability.
