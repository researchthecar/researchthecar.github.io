### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ram 1500 demonstrates solid overall reliability, with its V8 and V6 gasoline engines generally performing well. The primary concerns revolve around potential oil leaks from the oil cooler on both gasoline engines and specific issues like lifter wear on the HEMI engines, which can be costly. The EcoDiesel engine, while efficient, has reported DPF and EGR cooler issues that require attention. Transmission reliability is decent, though some owners experience shifting anomalies. Suspension components like ball joints can wear, and the optional air suspension has its own set of potential failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect system and occasional battery drain, are noted. Exterior issues are minor, mainly concerning tailgate latches and headlight condensation. Interior problems are infrequent. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of these issues are key to maintaining a reliable 2016 Ram 1500.
