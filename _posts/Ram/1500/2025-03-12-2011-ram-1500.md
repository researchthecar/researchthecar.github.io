The 2011 Ram 1500 is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its comfortable ride, bold styling, and strong performance. Engine options include a 3.7L V6 producing 215 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, a 4.7L V8 producing 310 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L Hemi V8 delivering 390 horsepower and 407 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic (with the 3.7L V6), a 6-speed automatic (with the 4.7L and 5.7L V8), and a 5-speed automatic (late production with the 4.7L). Owners often praise the Ram 1500 for its comfortable interior, particularly in higher trim levels, and its powerful V8 engine options. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, particularly with the V8 engines, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2011 Ram 1500 has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant are potential electrical problems related to the TIPM, which can be costly to fix. Hemi engine owners should listen for the "Hemi tick" and address exhaust manifold leaks promptly. Transmission issues with the 6-speed automatic, while not universally experienced, can also be a significant repair expense. Suspension noises are relatively common and usually involve replacing wear items. While these issues exist, many 2011 Ram 1500s provide reliable service. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify and address potential problems before buying.
