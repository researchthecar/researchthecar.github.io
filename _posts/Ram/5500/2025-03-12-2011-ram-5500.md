The 2011 Ram 5500 is a heavy-duty chassis cab truck known for its workhorse capabilities, towing capacity, and robust build. It was offered with a 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel inline-6 engine producing 305-350 horsepower and 650-800 lb-ft of torque, depending on the configuration. A 5.7L HEMI V8 gasoline engine, rated at 383 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, was also an option. Transmissions included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic. Many owners appreciate the truck's raw power and towing capability but find the ride quality and interior appointments less refined than lighter-duty trucks. Common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty trucks.

**Engine**

**6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, excessive black smoke, loud whining noise from the turbocharger, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect and clean or replace the air filter and check for any other potential causes of turbo failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, reduced fuel economy, and potential engine knocking. Can lead to serious engine damage if left untreated.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific faulty injector(s) and replace them. Recalibrate the ECM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+ (per injector, if multiple injectors fail, the cost can increase significantly)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, poor fuel economy, check engine light, and potential stalling. Clogging of the EGR cooler can also occur.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. Inspect and clean the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **"Hemi Tick" (Lifter/Valve Train Noise)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noise, especially at idle. In more severe cases, can lead to camshaft or lifter failure.
    *   Solution: In some cases, using heavier weight oil or additives might temporarily reduce the noise. For a permanent fix, replacing the affected lifters and possibly the camshaft is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, especially on cold starts, exhaust leak smell, reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts. Sometimes the manifold itself may be warped or cracked and need to be replaced as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, slipping between gears, and potential transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Inspect the transmission fluid for contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and potential transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Ensure proper fluid level and condition.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front end, especially when going over bumps, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per side)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sagging Leaf Springs (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sits lower than normal, especially when loaded, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potential ride quality issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs for increased load capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent starting problems, fuel pump relay failure, lighting issues, and other electrical gremlins.
    *   Solution: Replace the TIPM. Ensure proper grounding and voltage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, sensors not working, and potential engine performance issues.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair damaged wiring. Replace sections of the harness as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and location of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on frame and body panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on frame rails, fenders, rocker panels, and other areas of the body.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust and treat with a rust inhibitor. Replacement of panels and coatings for heavily rusted areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ (depending on severity)

**Summary**

The 2011 Ram 5500, while a capable work truck, can suffer from a range of issues, some potentially costly. The diesel engine is prone to turbocharger, fuel injector, and EGR valve problems, while the HEMI V8 can experience exhaust manifold bolt failures and lifter noise. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and valve body, are also reported. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out prematurely. Electrical problems, notably TIPM failures, can be frustrating. Rust and dashboard cracking are also common. Severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Buyers should carefully inspect these areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
