### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ram 5500 demonstrates strong overall reliability, especially with its robust 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel engine and heavy-duty transmissions. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the EGR cooler and turbocharger on the diesel engine, and torque converter or overheating issues with the automatic transmission. Manual transmissions are generally solid, though clutch wear is a factor. Electrical components like the BCM and alternator can occasionally fail. Suspension leaf springs may break under extreme use. Interior electronics, particularly the infotainment screen and HVAC blower motor, can also present issues. Despite these points, the Ram 5500 remains a dependable choice for heavy-duty work when properly maintained.
