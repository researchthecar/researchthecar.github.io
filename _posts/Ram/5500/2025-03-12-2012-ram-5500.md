The 2012 Ram 5500 is a heavy-duty chassis cab truck known for its towing and payload capabilities. It was offered with several engine options including the 5.7L Hemi V8 (383 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), the 6.4L Hemi V8 (370 hp, 429 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel I6 (305 hp, 610 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed automatic and a 6-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners appreciate the truck's robust build, powerful engines (especially the Cummins), and workhorse capabilities. Some common complaints include ride quality, particularly when unloaded, and fuel economy with the gasoline engines.

**Summary**
The 2012 Ram 5500 is a capable work truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The Cummins diesel can suffer from turbo, injector, and EGR cooler failures, which can be expensive to repair. Electrical issues related to the TIPM are also fairly common. Suspension components such as ball joints, tie rod ends and leaf springs are prone to wearing out over time due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be costly and impact the vehicle's reliability. Careful inspection and preventative maintenance are essential for keeping a 2012 Ram 5500 in good working order.
