### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Ram 5500, equipped with the robust 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel, generally exhibits strong mechanical reliability, as expected for a heavy-duty commercial vehicle. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the emissions system (EGR cooler) and the turbocharger, which can require significant repairs. For transmissions, both the automatic (68RFE) and manual (G56) have documented issues, with torque converter shudder and clutch wear being the most common, respectively. Electrical gremlins, particularly those related to the Body Control Module, can also arise. However, the chassis, suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically very durable. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating potential repair costs and ensuring the longevity of this work-oriented truck.
