**Introduction**

The 2020 Genesis G70 is a compact luxury sedan that offers a refined driving experience. It's available with a choice of two engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that produces 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 that produces 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque.
