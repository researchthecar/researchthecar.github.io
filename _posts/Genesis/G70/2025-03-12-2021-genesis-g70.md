The 2021 Genesis G70 is a luxury sports sedan known for its stylish design, engaging driving dynamics, and impressive value proposition. It offers two engine options: a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L twin-turbocharged V6 delivering 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the G70 for its comfortable and well-appointed interior, sporty handling, and extensive list of standard features. Some criticisms include a slightly cramped rear seat and less cargo space compared to some competitors.
