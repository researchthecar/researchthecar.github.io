The 2023 Genesis G70 is a luxury sport sedan offering a blend of performance, style, and value. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder producing 252 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 generating 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. What people generally appreciate about the G70 are its athletic handling, luxurious interior, and extensive features for the price. Downsides often cited include the relatively small rear seats and trunk, and the infotainment system, while improved, isn't always as intuitive as some competitors.
