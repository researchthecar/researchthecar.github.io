Alright, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2022 Genesis GV80, categorized as requested. The GV80 is a mid-size luxury SUV from Genesis, known for its elegant design, comfortable ride, and strong value proposition. It's available with two engine options: a 2.5L turbocharged inline-4 producing 300 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 delivering 375 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GV80 for its luxurious interior, smooth ride, and advanced technology features. Some common criticisms include the sometimes-complex infotainment system and the availability of some features being trim-level dependent.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the engine hesitating during acceleration or even stalling, particularly when starting or at low speeds. This may be intermittent and difficult to replicate consistently.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis requires a scan for trouble codes, inspection of fuel delivery components (fuel pump, injectors), and potentially software updates to the engine control module (ECM). In some cases, replacement of faulty sensors (e.g., mass airflow sensor, crankshaft position sensor) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported oil leaks, often originating from the turbocharger oil lines or valve cover gaskets. Symptoms may include the smell of burning oil, visible oil drips under the vehicle, or low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves a thorough inspection to pinpoint the source of the leak. Repair typically involves replacing the leaking gaskets or seals, or tightening connections. In more severe cases, turbocharger replacement may be required if the leak originates within the turbo itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $2,500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
