# 2024 Genesis Electrified G80

### Overview
The 2024 Genesis Electrified G80 represents a significant step forward in luxury electric sedans, blending sophisticated design with advanced technology and a refined driving experience. As a relatively new entrant in the EV market, particularly in its electrified form, long-term reliability data is still accumulating. However, based on initial owner feedback and the established reputation of Genesis's parent company, Hyundai, the Electrified G80 is anticipated to offer a high level of dependability. The focus is on robust electric powertrain components, advanced battery management systems, and the premium build quality expected from the Genesis brand. Early indicators suggest a strong performance in key reliability areas, though as with any new model, minor software glitches or component adjustments may occur during the initial ownership period.
