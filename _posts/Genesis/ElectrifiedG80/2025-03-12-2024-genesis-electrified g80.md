The 2024 Genesis Electrified G80 is an all-electric luxury sedan positioned as an electrified version of the popular G80. Unlike the standard G80, which offers gasoline engine options, the Electrified G80 is exclusively available with an electric powertrain. This powertrain consists of two electric motors, one at the front and one at the rear, providing all-wheel drive. The combined output is around 365 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. The Electrified G80 is praised for its elegant design, luxurious interior, smooth and quiet ride, and quick acceleration. Some common criticisms include a high price point compared to the gasoline-powered G80 and limited range compared to some other EVs in its class.
