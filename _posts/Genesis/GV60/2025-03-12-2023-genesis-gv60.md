The 2023 Genesis GV60 is an all-electric luxury crossover SUV offering a blend of sporty performance and sophisticated design. The GV60 is available with a variety of powertrain configurations, all featuring a dual-motor setup for all-wheel drive. The base model offers around 314 horsepower and 446 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful version boosts output to 429 horsepower and 516 lb-ft, with a Boost Mode temporarily increasing those figures to 483 hp and 516 lb-ft. Reviewers often praise the GV60 for its quick acceleration, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior. However, some criticisms include the relatively small cargo space and the limited availability of charging infrastructure compared to gasoline vehicles.

**Electric Motor**

**Standard Dual-Motor AWD**
*   **Drive Motor Control Software Errors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a sudden loss of power or the vehicle entering a "limp home" mode. This is frequently attributed to glitches in the drive motor control software, which may misinterpret sensor data or encounter internal errors.
    *   Solution: The common resolution involves a software update performed by a Genesis dealer. The update typically reprograms the drive motor control module to correct the software errors and prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A (Software updates are usually covered under warranty)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Performance Dual-Motor AWD**
*   **Drive Motor Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some drivers using the "Boost Mode" frequently, or driving aggressively for extended periods, have reported the motors overheating. Symptoms include warning lights on the dashboard, reduced performance, and the vehicle limiting power output to prevent further damage.
    *   Solution: A potential fix involves installing an improved cooling system for the motors, which may be a hardware upgrade provided by Genesis. However, the most immediate solution is to reduce the strain on the motors by driving less aggressively.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: The cost for cooling system replacement is unknown and will vary, but may be covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Battery Management System (BMS) Errors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports exist of owners encountering issues with the Battery Management System (BMS). This can manifest as inaccurate state-of-charge readings, slower-than-expected charging speeds, or in some cases, complete charging failure. Error messages related to the BMS might be displayed on the vehicle's instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic scan is usually performed by a Genesis technician to identify the root cause of the BMS error. In some cases, a software update to the BMS module can resolve the issue. In more severe instances, a faulty sensor or even a complete BMS replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A - Covered under warranty, unless caused by owner negligence.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical System**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Several owners have reported experiencing frequent freezing or crashing of the infotainment system. This can result in loss of navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions controlled through the screen.
    *   Solution: The initial fix often involves a software update for the infotainment system. If the issue persists, more in-depth diagnostics may be required, potentially leading to replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A - Usually covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Connectivity Issues (Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced intermittent connectivity issues with Bluetooth devices, Apple CarPlay, or Android Auto. Symptoms include difficulty pairing devices, dropped connections, or distorted audio.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting steps typically involve updating the infotainment system software, verifying device compatibility, and ensuring proper USB cable connection for wired connections. In some cases, a faulty USB port may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for USB port replacement (if not covered under warranty).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Flush Door Handles Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GV60 features automatic flush door handles that extend when the vehicle is unlocked. Some owners have reported instances where the handles fail to deploy or retract properly, particularly in cold weather conditions.
    *   Solution: The fix often involves lubricating the door handle mechanism or, in more severe cases, replacing the faulty door handle assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500 per door handle (if not covered under warranty).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises from Trim Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling or squeaking noises emanating from various trim panels within the cabin, particularly the dashboard, door panels, or center console. These noises can be distracting and detract from the vehicle's perceived luxury.
    *   Solution: The solution often involves identifying the source of the noise and then either tightening loose fasteners, adding padding or insulation to prevent friction, or replacing the offending trim panel altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$500+ (depending on the severity and location of the issue, and whether it's covered under warranty).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Digital Instrument Cluster Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the digital instrument cluster experiencing occasional glitches, such as flickering, display errors, or temporary blanking out.
    *   Solution: This may require a software update to the instrument cluster. In some cases, the instrument cluster unit might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A - Should be covered under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Genesis GV60, while praised for its performance and luxury features, exhibits some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most frequently reported problems involve the electrical system, particularly the infotainment system and connectivity features. Some owners have also noted issues with the flush door handles, trim panel rattles, and digital instrument cluster glitches. While the severity and cost of these issues can vary, many are covered under the vehicle's warranty. It's recommended that potential buyers thoroughly inspect the vehicle and inquire about any relevant recalls or service bulletins before making a purchase. The electric motor and battery system issues appear less frequently but could be more significant if they occur, so understanding the warranty coverage for these components is crucial.
