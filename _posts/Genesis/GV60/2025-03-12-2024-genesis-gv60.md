The 2024 Genesis GV60 is an all-electric luxury crossover that combines sleek styling, a premium interior, and impressive performance. It offers a compelling alternative to other electric SUVs in its class. The GV60 comes standard with a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system. The standard powertrain produces 314 horsepower and 446 lb-ft of torque. The Performance trim bumps the power up to 429 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, and includes a "Boost" mode that temporarily increases output to 483 horsepower. Many owners praise the GV60's quick acceleration, comfortable ride, and upscale features. Some criticisms include the somewhat limited rear cargo space and the learning curve associated with some of the advanced technology features.

**Electric Motor**

**Standard Dual Motor AWD**

*   **Reduced Power Output/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances where the vehicle enters a "turtle mode" or significantly reduces power output, especially under heavy acceleration or when the battery is at a lower state of charge. This can be accompanied by warning messages on the dashboard indicating a powertrain malfunction.
    *   Solution: The dealer should perform a diagnostic scan to identify the root cause. Potential solutions can range from software updates to component replacement, such as sensors or modules related to the electric motor control system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depends on the failed parts and extent of the damage, $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

* **Premature Battery Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have expressed concerns about experiencing faster-than-expected battery degradation, leading to a noticeable decrease in range over a relatively short period.
    * Solution: Hyundai/Genesis has an 8-10 year / 100,000 mile warranty, which should cover major degradation of the battery. A dealer can perform a battery health check.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Warrantied
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may experience freezing, lagging, or unexpected reboots. Connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto have also been reported.
    *   Solution: Often, a software update from the dealer can resolve these glitches. In more severe cases, the infotainment unit itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free. Infotainment unit replacement could range from $500 - $1,500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with features like lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, or blind-spot monitoring may occur. These can manifest as intermittent failures, false warnings, or inaccurate readings.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of the affected sensors or replacement of faulty components (e.g., radar sensors, cameras) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Sensor recalibration can cost $200 - $500. Sensor/Camera replacement costs can range from $500 - $2,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, responsible for powering auxiliary systems, can drain prematurely, leading to starting problems or system malfunctions. This is a common issue with many EVs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the 12V battery with an upgraded or more robust unit can often resolve the issue. Also, ensure all software updates are installed to optimize battery management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for a new battery plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Charging Port Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported problems with the charging port door not opening or closing properly.
    *   Solution: The dealer needs to inspect the door mechanism and replace any faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Creaking/Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported various creaking or rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or seats, especially when driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Locate and isolate the source of the noise. Apply felt tape or lubricant to contact points to eliminate the friction causing the sound. Dealership might attempt to fix under warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ depending on complexity and whether DIY or professional repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Genesis GV60 is generally considered a reliable vehicle, but some owners have reported experiencing electrical issues, motor malfunctions, and interior noises. The electrical and ADAS related issues seem to be the most common and potentially expensive to address if not covered under warranty. Battery degradation should be covered under warranty, but the amount of degradation is typically subjective, and may be a point of contention with the dealer. Overall, the severity of these issues varies, and potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and ensure they are addressed during the purchasing process.
