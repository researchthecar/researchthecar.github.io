The 2024 Genesis G90 is a luxury sedan that aims to compete with established rivals like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series. The standard engine is a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine, producing 409 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. An optional upgrade is the same 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, boosting performance and efficiency. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People often praise the G90 for its opulent interior, smooth ride, extensive standard features, and relatively lower price point compared to its competitors. Common dislikes include a less engaging driving experience than some rivals, and a brand image that is still developing compared to established luxury marques.
