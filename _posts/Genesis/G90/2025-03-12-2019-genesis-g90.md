The 2019 Genesis G90 is a full-size luxury sedan known for its opulent interior, comfortable ride, and extensive list of standard features. It offers two engine options: a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 producing 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0-liter V8 generating 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically praise the G90 for its value proposition, luxurious appointments, quiet cabin, and smooth ride. Common criticisms include its conservative styling, lack of brand recognition compared to established luxury brands, and infotainment system which while functional, may not be as intuitive as some competitors.

**Overall Summary:**

The 2019 Genesis G90 generally exhibits a good level of reliability, but like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The most commonly reported problems relate to the electrical system, specifically the infotainment system and battery drain. Suspension issues with the air suspension are also reported. A potential safety concern is the Automatic Emergency Braking system malfunctioning causing it to brake unexpectedly. Repair costs can range from relatively minor expenses for software updates and recalibrations to more significant costs for replacing components like the air suspension compressor or infotainment system unit. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and ensure that any used G90 has been properly maintained and any applicable recalls have been addressed.
