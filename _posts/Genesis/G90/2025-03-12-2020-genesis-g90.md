The 2020 Genesis G90 is a full-size luxury sedan that aims to offer a premium experience at a more competitive price point than its established German rivals. Two engine options are available: a 3.3L twin-turbocharged V6 producing 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L naturally aspirated V8 delivering 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the G90 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, long list of standard features, and strong value proposition. Common criticisms include a less engaging driving experience compared to sportier competitors, a less prestigious brand image, and some dated interior design elements.
