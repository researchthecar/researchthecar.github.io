The 2018 Genesis G90 is a luxury sedan that offers a comfortable ride, a spacious interior, and a range of features. Two engine options were available: a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 producing 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0-liter naturally aspirated V8 generating 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the G90 for its value proposition, quiet cabin, and smooth ride. Common complaints include the somewhat bland styling (for a luxury car), lack of brand recognition compared to established German rivals, and some infotainment system quirks.

**Engine**

**3.3L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are occasionally reported, particularly around the valve cover gaskets and the turbocharger oil lines. This can result in visible oil spots under the car, a burning oil smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or lines. Ensure proper torque during reassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the source of the leak and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8**

*   **Engine Knocking/Ticking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a knocking or ticking noise, especially at cold start or idle. This could be related to the hydraulic lash adjusters or timing chain components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is crucial. May require replacement of lash adjusters or timing chain components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the specific component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported occasional harsh shifts, particularly during downshifts or when accelerating from a stop. Hesitation or a delay in shifting can also occur.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change using the correct fluid specification. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be needed, including checking solenoids and valve body. In some cases, a software update might address the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+ (depending on the severity and required repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The G90 may be equipped with an air suspension system. Problems can arise such as the car sagging, the air compressor failing, or error messages related to the suspension system.
    *   Solution: Identify the faulty component (air strut, compressor, height sensor). Replacement is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (per strut, depending on whether aftermarket or OEM parts are used)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can experience occasional glitches, such as freezing, slow response times, or Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the system. Software updates from the dealer can often resolve these issues. In rare cases, the head unit might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) to $1,500+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failures with sensors such as the parking sensors can occur. Symptoms include inaccurate readings or complete failure of the system.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor and replacing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Trunk Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic trunk mechanism might fail to open or close properly. This can be due to a faulty motor, sensor, or hinge.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the defective part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Adjustment Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power seat adjustment motors can fail, preventing the seat from moving in one or more directions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per motor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Genesis G90 generally exhibits issues typical of a luxury vehicle, with some specific concerns related to the infotainment system and potentially the air suspension (if equipped). Engine and transmission issues are less frequently reported but can occur. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, depending on the specific problem. While some issues may be relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, such as air suspension or engine component failures, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems.
