The 2021 Genesis G90 is a luxury sedan that aims to provide a comfortable and refined driving experience. For the 2021 model year, it was available with two engine options: a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 producing 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0-liter naturally aspirated V8 generating 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the G90 for its luxurious interior, smooth ride, and extensive standard features. Criticisms often center around its lack of brand recognition compared to established luxury automakers, and some feel its driving dynamics aren't as engaging as some of its competitors.

**Summary**

The 2021 Genesis G90, while generally reliable, can experience some issues. Turbocharger failures in the 3.3T engine and air suspension problems represent some of the more expensive potential repairs. Infotainment glitches and electrical sensor issues can be annoying and may require dealer attention. Transmission issues appear less frequently, but are still notable. The issues range from minor annoyances to potentially costly repairs, and the problems can range anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to upwards of a few thousand dollars. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's systems before purchasing.
