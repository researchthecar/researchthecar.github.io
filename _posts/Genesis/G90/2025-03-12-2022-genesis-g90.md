Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2022 Genesis G90, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration, based on available information. Please note that the 2022 G90 was a transition year before the redesigned 2023 model. Therefore, information is a bit more limited compared to models with longer production runs.

The 2022 Genesis G90 is a luxury sedan known for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and extensive features list. It was offered with two engine options: a 3.3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 producing 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0-liter V8 generating 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the G90 for its value proposition compared to its European rivals, comfortable interior, and quiet cabin. Common complaints often revolve around the somewhat less engaging driving experience compared to sportier sedans, the infotainment system's complexity (though improved over previous generations), and the potential for higher repair costs associated with a luxury vehicle.

**Engine**

**3.3L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, check engine light. Could be due to a faulty wastegate actuator or a vacuum leak in the system controlling it.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the wastegate actuator or repair of vacuum lines. Diagnosis often requires a scan tool to monitor turbocharger boost pressure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the engine, burning oil smell, low oil level. Can be from valve cover gaskets or the front crankshaft seal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on location
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update) - $2,500+ (valve body)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunctions (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting unevenly, failure to adjust ride height, warning lights on the dashboard. This is more common in models equipped with the air suspension system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the air suspension system, which may involve replacing the air struts, compressor, or ride height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: System freezing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation problems.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Issues (Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alerts, system not functioning, error messages.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using a scan tool to identify the faulty sensor and replacement.

**Summary**

The 2022 Genesis G90, while generally reliable, can exhibit issues common to luxury vehicles with complex systems. The most concerning problems involve potential issues with the turbochargers on the 3.3L engine, oil leaks on the 5.0L V8, the air suspension (if equipped), and the infotainment system. The cost of repairs can vary significantly, with some electronic glitches being easily resolved by software updates, while mechanical repairs like turbocharger or suspension replacements can be quite expensive. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic experienced with Genesis vehicles to identify any existing or potential problems.
