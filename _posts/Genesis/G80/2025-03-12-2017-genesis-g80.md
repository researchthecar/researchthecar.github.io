The 2017 Genesis G80 marked the first model year after the Genesis brand spun off from Hyundai. It offered a blend of luxury, comfort, and value that appealed to many buyers. Engine options included a 3.8L V6 producing 311 horsepower and 293 lb-ft of torque, a 3.3L Twin-Turbo V6 making 365 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L V8 generating 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the G80's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and extensive standard features. Common dislikes included the somewhat generic styling (particularly compared to European rivals) and the lack of brand recognition at the time.

**Summary**

The 2017 Genesis G80 generally presents a relatively reliable ownership experience. However, some owners have reported issues with oil consumption on the 3.8L V6 and harsh shifting from the 8-speed transmission. Electrical glitches, such as infotainment system issues, are also possibilities. The suspension components could also have issues, but are easy to repair.

Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
