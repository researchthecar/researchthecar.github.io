The 2021 Genesis G80 marked a significant redesign for the model, offering a more luxurious and refined experience compared to its predecessor. Engine options included a 2.5L turbocharged inline-4 (300 hp, 311 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 (375 hp, 391 lb-ft of torque), and in some markets, a 2.2L diesel engine. All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally praise the G80 for its elegant styling, comfortable ride, and generous features for the price. Criticisms often focus on the less engaging driving experience compared to some rivals and the infotainment system's complexity.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. The exact cause is debated, but some speculate it may be related to piston ring design or turbocharger seals.
    *   Solution: Dealers often perform an oil consumption test to monitor the rate of consumption. Depending on the results, the fix could range from software updates to piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+, depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

*   **Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the turbocharger wastegate actuator failing, resulting in a loss of power, potentially triggering the check engine light, and causing the vehicle to enter a limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger wastegate actuator, or potentially the entire turbocharger assembly depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds or during downshifts. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop has also been noted.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software Update) - $5,000+ (Transmission Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with the optional air suspension have experienced issues such as the vehicle sagging or uneven ride height, potentially due to leaks in the air struts or compressor malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air strut, air compressor, or air line.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per corner, depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system can be prone to freezing, crashing, or experiencing glitches, requiring a restart of the system.
    *   Solution: Software updates, or in some cases, replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $1,500+ (Head Unit Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty sensors can lead to inaccurate readings or false warnings for features like blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, and parking sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the malfunctioning sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor.

**Summary**

The 2021 Genesis G80, while generally well-received, has some common issues owners have reported. Engine issues can be costly to repair and have a high severity, with the most concerning issues being excessive oil consumption and turbocharger actuator failure. Transmission issues are reported, but may be fixed with a simple software update. Air suspension issues (if equipped) can also be expensive. Electrical glitches, especially with the infotainment system, are a common annoyance. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems. The cost to fix these issues is also highly variable and could become quite expensive.
