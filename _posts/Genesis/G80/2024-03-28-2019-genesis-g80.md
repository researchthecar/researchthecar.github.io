* **Timing chain rattling:** A rattling noise during startup and acceleration may indicate a worn timing chain.
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Failure of the intake manifold gaskets can lead to engine misfires and performance loss.

**3.3L Turbocharged V6**
* **Engine knocking:** Knocking or rattling sounds from the engine may be caused by turbocharger issues or worn piston rings.
* **Coolant leaks:** Leaks from the coolant system can result in overheating and engine damage.

**5.0L V8**

**Transmission**

**Eight-Speed Automatic**
* **Shifting problems:** Occasional hesitation or rough shifting may indicate transmission fluid issues or mechanical problems.
* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip out of gear while driving, resulting in a loss of power.
* **Reverse gear failure:** Failure of the transmission to engage reverse gear can make parking and maneuvering difficult.

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension noise:** Rattling or clunking sounds from the front suspension may be caused by worn bushings or ball joints.
* **Rear suspension sag:** Sagging of the rear suspension can result in uneven tire wear and poor ride quality.
* **Air suspension failure:** Air suspension components, such as the compressor or air bags, may malfunction, affecting ride height and stability.

**Electrical**

* **Headlight condensation:** Condensation buildup inside the headlights can affect visibility and may require replacement.
* **Sunroof drain leaks:** Clogged or damaged sunroof drains can cause water leaks inside the vehicle.

**Interior**
