**Introduction:**

The 2018 Genesis G80 is a mid-sized luxury sedan praised for its spacious interior, advanced technology, and refined driving experience. It is available with two engine options: a turbocharged 3.3L V6 and a twin-turbocharged 3.8L V6. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.3L Turbocharged V6 (365 horsepower, 376 lb-ft torque)**

- **Intake Valve Deposits:** Over time, carbon buildup on the intake valves can reduce engine performance and fuel economy. Symptoms may include rough idling, reduced acceleration, and increased emissions. The fix involves walnut blasting or chemical cleaning the intake valves.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

**3.8L Twin-Turbocharged V6 (420 horsepower, 440 lb-ft torque)**

- **Turbocharger Cooling Issues:** In some cases, the turbochargers may experience cooling issues leading to reduced performance and premature wear. Symptoms may include decreased acceleration, excessive exhaust noise, and in severe cases, engine damage. Replacing the turbochargers with revised units is the solution.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

- **Shifting Issues:** Some owners have reported issues with the transmission hesitating or slipping during shifts. The problem may be caused by faulty solenoid packs or valve bodies. Replacing the affected components resolves the issue.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

- **Battery Drain:** Some vehicles have faced excessive battery drain leading to difficulty starting. The issue may be caused by a faulty module or component within the electrical system. Diagnosing and replacing the problematic part solves the problem.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
  - Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

- **Headlight Condensation:** Condensation within the headlight assembly is a common issue, leading to fogging up or water droplets inside the headlights. The issue may be resolved by replacing the affected headlights with updated units.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

- **Climate Control Malfunctions:** A few cases have been reported of faulty climate control units. Symptoms include erratic temperature control, fan speed issues, or HVAC system failures. Replacing the climate control module or related components can fix the problem.
  - Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
  - Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

While the Genesis G80 is generally a reliable vehicle, there are a few issues to be aware of. The most common problems involve intake valve deposits, turbocharger cooling issues, transmission shifting issues, suspension compressor failures, and excessive battery drain. Most issues are not severe and can be fixed for a moderate cost, although turbocharger issues can be expensive.
