The 2022 Genesis GV70 is a luxury compact SUV known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and strong performance. It offers two engine options: a 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 300 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged V6 delivering 375 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GV70's elegant interior, advanced technology features, and engaging driving dynamics. Some common dislikes include the sometimes-complicated infotainment system and the limited cargo space compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.5L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine hesitation or stalling, particularly at lower speeds or when accelerating from a stop. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) has resolved the issue. Other times, replacement of faulty sensors (such as the mass airflow sensor) or cleaning of the throttle body has been necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Twin-Turbocharged V6**

*   **Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the turbocharger wastegate actuator, leading to reduced engine power and potential error codes. Symptoms can include a noticeable loss of acceleration, especially at higher speeds, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty wastegate actuator is typically required. In some cases, the entire turbocharger assembly may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting or jerking, particularly when shifting between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during cold starts or in stop-and-go traffic.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, replacement of valve body components or even the entire transmission may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, which controls navigation, audio, and vehicle settings, may freeze or crash, requiring a system reboot. This can occur randomly and can be frustrating for owners.
    *   Solution: A software update is often the first step to address this issue. If the problem persists, the infotainment system may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+ (depending on warranty coverage)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **"Check Blind Spot System" Error**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent error message about the blind spot detection system not working. The system will either turn off for no reason, or not show cars even if they are in the blind spot.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blind spot detection module or sensor in the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic High Beam Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic high beam system may not function correctly, either failing to dim the high beams when oncoming traffic is detected or flickering on and off unnecessarily.
    *   Solution: Recalibration or replacement of the sensor that detects light.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Driver's Seat Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Drivers report that the driver's seat may make a squeaking or creaking noise when going over bumps or turning corners.
    *   Solution: Tightening or lubricating the seat frame and mechanisms may resolve the noise. In some cases, the seat frame may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Dashboard Reflections**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted that the dashboard material can reflect in the windshield, causing glare and potentially obstructing the driver's view, especially in bright sunlight.
    *   Solution: Using a dashboard cover or applying a non-reflective coating to the dashboard surface may help reduce glare.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found
