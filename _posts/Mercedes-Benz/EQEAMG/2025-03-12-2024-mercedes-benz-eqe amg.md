**Electric Motor**

**Dual-Motor All-Wheel Drive (617-677 hp)**

*   **Reduced Power or "turtle mode"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners reported that on very rare occasions, the car randomly goes into a "turtle mode", drastically reducing power output. The car is limited to 20-30mph. Restarting the car sometimes temporarily fixes the issue, but it can return. Some report getting a "Reduced Performance" message on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: The motor control unit can be reset or replaced. The vehicle needs to be taken to a dealership to diagnose the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis costs range from $150-$300. Repair costs could vary from software reset ($0) to several thousands of dollars, depending on the faulty part.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Reduced Range and/or Charging Speed**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted experiencing lower-than-advertised range, especially in cold weather conditions. Additionally, some have reported slower charging speeds than the vehicle's maximum charging capacity.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the battery management system may require a software update to optimize charging and range. If a battery cell is degrading, the battery pack may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are usually free. Replacing the battery pack can cost $15,000 - $25,000+.

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, which powers auxiliary systems, can drain prematurely, leading to starting problems or system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to identify the parasitic draw. Replacing the 12V battery is a temporary fix; addressing the underlying cause is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement: $200 - $500. Diagnosis and repair of parasitic draw: $100 - $1,000+, depending on the complexity.
