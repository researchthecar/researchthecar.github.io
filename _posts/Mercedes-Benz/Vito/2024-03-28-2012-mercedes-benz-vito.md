**Introduction:**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Vito is a versatile commercial van offered in various configurations. It features a powerful engine but is criticized for its limited features and cabin comfort. Engine options include a 2.2-liter diesel with 136 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque and a 1.6-liter diesel with 114 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.2-liter Diesel**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging:** Excessive soot accumulation can clog the DPF, leading to reduced engine power and increased fuel consumption. Solution: Replacing the DPF costs $1,500 - $2,500+.
* **Turbocharger Failure:** Turbocharger failure can cause loss of power, smoke from the exhaust, and unusual noises. Solution: Replacing the turbocharger costs $1,200 - $2,000+.

**1.6-liter Diesel**

* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Malfunctioning fuel injectors can cause rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a decrease in power. Solution: Replacing a fuel injector costs $300 - $500+.

**Transmission**

**6-speed Manual**

* **Gearbox Oil Leak:** A leak in the gearbox can cause low oil levels, resulting in premature wear and potential failure. Solution: Repairing an oil leak costs $500 - $1,000+.

**5-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** Slipping transmissions can cause delays in gear changes, abnormal noises, and reduced torque transfer. Solution: A transmission rebuild or replacement costs $1,500 - $3,000+.

**Suspension**

* **Rear Leaf Spring Failure:** Excessive weight or heavy loads can cause rear leaf springs to break or sag. Solution: Replacing leaf springs costs $500 - $1,200+.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Electrical components drawing power even when the engine is off can drain the battery. Solution: A parasitic battery drain diagnostic and repair costs $150 - $300+.
* **Alternator Failure:** Alternator failure can prevent the battery from charging, leading to electrical system malfunctions. Solution: Replacing an alternator costs $600 - $1,200+.

**Exterior**

* **Door Handle Failure:** Door handles may stick or break due to wear or corrosion. Solution: Replacing a door handle costs $100 - $200+.
* **Rusty Brake Discs:** Brake discs may rust due to moisture exposure, leading to uneven braking and reduced performance. Solution: Replacing brake discs costs $400 - $800+.

**Interior**

* **Heater Fan Failure:** The heating system fan may fail, causing discomfort in cold or damp conditions. Solution: Replacing the fan costs $250 - $400+.
* **AC Compressor Issues:** AC compressors may malfunction, resulting in inadequate cooling. Solution: Replacing an AC compressor costs $1,000 - $1,500+.

**Summary**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Vito has several known issues that can impact its reliability and performance. Engine problems like DPF clogging and turbocharger failure can be costly to repair. Transmission slippage and rear leaf spring failure are also common issues. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and alternator failure, can lead to various malfunctions. While interior and exterior issues are less severe, they can still affect the overall experience of owning the vehicle. These issues can vary in severity and cost, so potential buyers should inspect vehicles carefully and consider the potential maintenance expenses.
