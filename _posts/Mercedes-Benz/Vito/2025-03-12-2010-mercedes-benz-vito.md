The 2010 Mercedes-Benz Vito is a versatile van known for its practicality and spaciousness. Engine options for the 2010 model year include the 2.1L CDI diesel engine, available in various power outputs, and the 3.0L CDI V6 diesel engine. A gasoline engine option, the 3.5L V6, was also available in some markets. The diesel engines were generally favored for their fuel efficiency and torque, making them suitable for commercial use.
