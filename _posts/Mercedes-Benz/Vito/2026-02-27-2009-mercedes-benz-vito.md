### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz Vito is a robust commercial vehicle, but like many vans of its age and intended use, it can develop specific issues. Diesel engines, particularly the CDI variants, are prone to DPF, turbocharger, and injector problems, while glow plug failures can affect starting. Manual transmissions may experience clutch wear, and automatics can suffer from fluid leaks and torque converter issues. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drains and alternator failures, are also reported. Exterior rust, especially in certain climates, and interior wear on seats and HVAC components are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the Vito's reliability.
