The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Vito is a versatile van popular for both commercial and private use, offering a balance of practicality and Mercedes-Benz refinement. Engine options for the 2013 Vito typically include a range of diesel engines, such as the 2.1L CDI variants (Vito 110 CDI, 113 CDI, 116 CDI) and a 3.0L CDI V6 engine (Vito 122 CDI). Horsepower figures range from around 95 hp in the lower-powered versions to upwards of 224 hp in the V6. Torque figures vary similarly, with the V6 offering significantly more pulling power. Transmissions generally include a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic (depending on the engine). Owners often praise the Vito for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and solid build quality. Common dislikes revolve around potential for electrical issues, and some find the base models lacking in features.

**Summary**

The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Vito, while generally reliable, can suffer from various issues. Engine problems, particularly with injectors, timing chains, and turbochargers on the 2.1L diesel, and oil cooler leaks and swirl flap issues on the 3.0L V6, represent some of the most potentially expensive repairs. Transmission problems, both automatic and manual, can also be costly. Electrical issues with door locks and SAM units, along with suspension issues, can add to the ownership burden. Sliding door mechanisms can also be problematic. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used 2013 Vito before purchase, paying close attention to engine noises, transmission smoothness, and electrical functionality. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission overhauls.
