The 2013 Mercedes-Benz B180 is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. The B180 typically features a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine producing around 122 horsepower and 200 Nm of torque. Other engine options included the B200 (156 hp), B220 CDI (170 hp) and B180 CDI (109 hp). Transmission options generally include a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (7G-DCT). Owners often praise the car's spacious interior, smooth ride, and fuel economy, but some criticize its somewhat uninspiring driving dynamics and higher maintenance costs compared to mainstream competitors.
