The 2015 Mercedes-Benz B180 is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. The B180 typically comes with a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine, producing around 122 horsepower and 200 Nm of torque. Other engine options for the 2015 B-Class range can include a 1.5-liter diesel engine and a 2.0-liter petrol engine. Transmission options usually consist of a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (7G-DCT). Owners generally appreciate the B180's spacious interior, smooth ride, and fuel economy, while some dislike the somewhat bland styling and higher maintenance costs associated with the Mercedes-Benz brand.
