### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz B180 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly in its suspension and exterior components. The most frequently reported technical issues tend to be concentrated in the powertrain, specifically with the dual-clutch transmission's mechatronics unit and potential coolant leaks or turbocharger problems in the petrol engines. Diesel variants may encounter DPF regeneration or injector issues. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor malfunctions and battery drain, are also noted. Interior electronics, like the infotainment and climate control systems, can occasionally experience glitches. While not inherently unreliable, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential areas and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections, especially for higher-mileage examples.
