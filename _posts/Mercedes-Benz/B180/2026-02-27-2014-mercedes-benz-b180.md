### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mercedes-Benz B180 demonstrates good overall reliability, with most common issues stemming from its advanced powertrain and electrical systems, particularly the dual-clutch transmission and emissions control components like the DPF and EGR valve on diesel models. Petrol engines and manual transmissions tend to be more straightforward. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches, are not uncommon in modern premium vehicles of this era. While routine maintenance is essential, major mechanical failures are not a widespread concern for well-maintained examples. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher repair costs associated with Mercedes-Benz components and labor compared to non-premium brands.
