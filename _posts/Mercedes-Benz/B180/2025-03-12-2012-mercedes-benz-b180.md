The 2012 Mercedes-Benz B180 is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. The B180 is equipped with a 1.6-liter turbocharged gasoline engine producing approximately 122 horsepower and 200 Nm of torque. Other engine options include the B200 (a more powerful version of the 1.6-liter turbo) and diesel variants (B180 CDI and B200 CDI). Transmission options typically include a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (7G-DCT). Owners often appreciate the B180 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and relatively good fuel economy. Common dislikes include reports of some reliability issues and higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury brands.
