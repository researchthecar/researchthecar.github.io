### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz B180, particularly with the petrol engine and manual transmission, shows good reliability. The diesel variants, while offering efficiency, are more prone to issues related to the turbocharger and DPF system, which can incur significant repair costs. The dual-clutch automatic transmission has also seen reports of mechatronic unit problems. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and battery drain, are not uncommon and require professional diagnosis. Overall, while not immune to problems, the B180 can be a reliable choice if well-maintained, with a preference for the petrol engine and manual gearbox for fewer potential technical headaches.
