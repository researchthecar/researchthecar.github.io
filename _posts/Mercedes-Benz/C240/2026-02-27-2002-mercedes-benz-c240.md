### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz C240 is a competent luxury sedan, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. The engine, while generally robust, can experience issues with sensors and gaskets. The automatic transmission, particularly the 722.6, is known for potential TCM and conductor plate problems. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster issues, are also common. Suspension components like bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior items like the HVAC resistor are not immune to failure. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these known weak points are crucial for maintaining the reliability of a 2002 C240.
