### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz C240 (W203) presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain is generally robust, common issues tend to emerge with age and mileage, particularly concerning the automatic transmission's electronic components and various engine seals. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and the instrument cluster display, are also frequently reported. Suspension components like control arm bushings and sway bar links are typical wear items that may require attention. Proactive maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission and regular checks for leaks, can significantly mitigate some of these potential problems. Overall, expect a comfortable luxury experience, but be prepared for potential repair costs associated with its German engineering.
