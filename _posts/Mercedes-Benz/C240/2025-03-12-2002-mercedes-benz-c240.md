**Summary**

The 2002 Mercedes-Benz C240, while a comfortable and stylish vehicle, is prone to several common issues as it ages. Engine oil leaks and crankshaft position sensor failures can affect performance, while transmission issues, particularly with the valve body, can be costly to repair. Suspension wear, especially in bushings and ball joints, is typical for a car of this age. Electrical problems like pixel loss in the instrument cluster and door lock actuator failures are also frequently reported. Rust on the lower body panels is a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission work or rust repair, can be quite costly, making a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing a used 2002 C240.
