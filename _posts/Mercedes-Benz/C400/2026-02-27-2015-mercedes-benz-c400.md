### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz C400 is a capable luxury sedan with a generally solid mechanical foundation. However, like many vehicles in its class, it is not immune to specific technical challenges. Potential owners should be aware of possible issues related to the twin-turbo V6 engine's wastegate actuators and valve cover gaskets, as well as the 7-speed automatic transmission's control module and torque converter. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. While the suspension is generally reliable, models equipped with air suspension may encounter leaks. Exterior and interior components have not shown widespread reliability concerns outside of normal wear. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and understanding potential repair costs are advisable.
