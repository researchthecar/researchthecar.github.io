The 2016 Mercedes-Benz C450 AMG, later rebranded as the C43 AMG, is a performance-oriented sedan that bridges the gap between the standard C-Class and the full-fledged AMG C63. It is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 362 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7G-TRONIC PLUS seven-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the C450 AMG for its blend of performance, luxury, and daily usability. Common praises include its responsive engine, sporty handling, and attractive interior. Criticisms often revolve around the somewhat stiff ride quality, particularly with the optional performance suspension, and the complexity of the infotainment system. The C450 was only offered with one engine and transmission option as described.
