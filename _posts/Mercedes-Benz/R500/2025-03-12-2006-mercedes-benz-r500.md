The 2006 Mercedes-Benz R500 is a unique blend of minivan and SUV, offering a spacious and luxurious ride. It features a 5.0L V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available for the 2006 R-Class include the R350 with a 3.5L V6 and the R320 CDI with a 3.0L diesel V6 (though the diesel was not always available in all markets or years). Owners appreciate the R500's comfortable interior, smooth ride, and ample cargo space. However, common complaints include the vehicle's complexity, leading to potentially expensive repairs, and its relatively poor fuel economy.
