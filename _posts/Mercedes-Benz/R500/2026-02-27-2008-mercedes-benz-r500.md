### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz R500 is a capable luxury vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues that can arise with age and mileage. The powertrain, particularly the 7-speed transmission, can be a source of significant repair costs if issues like solenoid malfunctions or torque converter problems occur. The optional air suspension is also a known area for potential expense due to leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, such as CAN bus errors, can also be complex and costly to diagnose. While the engine itself is robust, routine maintenance and addressing oil/coolant leaks promptly are crucial. Overall, expect higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury brands, and factor in potential repairs for the transmission and suspension systems.
