### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz R500 is a capable and luxurious vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with its advanced systems. The 5.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but leaks from oil cooler seals and intake manifold gaskets can occur. The 7G-TRONIC transmission, while smooth, is prone to costly issues with its control module and valve body. Optional air suspension components can also be a significant expense if they fail. Electrical gremlins, especially CAN bus communication errors, are not uncommon in Mercedes-Benz vehicles of this vintage. Interior components like sunroofs and seat controls can also develop faults. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for managing the long-term ownership costs of the R500.
