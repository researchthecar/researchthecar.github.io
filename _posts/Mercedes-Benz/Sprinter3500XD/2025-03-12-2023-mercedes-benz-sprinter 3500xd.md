**Summary**

The 2023 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500XD, while highly capable, is not without its issues. The most common problems revolve around the diesel engine's DEF system, potential turbocharger failures in the gasoline engine, and transmission issues with rough shifting. Electrical glitches with the MBUX system and sensor malfunctions are also frequently reported. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix (rattles, sliding door adjustments), others, such as transmission or turbocharger replacement, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a 2023 Sprinter 3500XD. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
