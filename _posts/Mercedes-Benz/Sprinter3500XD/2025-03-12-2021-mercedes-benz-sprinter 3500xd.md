The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500XD is a popular choice for commercial use, offering a spacious cargo area and robust capabilities. The 2021 model typically comes with a 3.0-liter V6 diesel engine (OM642) that produces around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. It is typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). While owners appreciate its payload capacity and customization options, common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the emissions system and electrical components, as well as the cost of maintenance and repairs. The Sprinter is also available with different wheelbase lengths and roof heights to tailor it to the needs of the user.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 Diesel (OM642)**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, warning lights illuminating on the dashboard (specifically the DPF light), and potential limp mode activation. Frequent regeneration cycles may also be observed.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration, cleaning the DPF, or DPF replacement. Addressing underlying causes of excessive soot production.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2500+ (depending on cleaning vs. replacement and labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, increased emissions, and a check engine light. The EGR valve may become clogged with carbon deposits, preventing proper operation.
    * Solution: EGR valve replacement. Cleaning the EGR cooler can sometimes help prevent future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Cooler Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the engine, often dripping onto the ground. Low oil levels, potential overheating if the leak is significant.
    * Solution: Replacement of the oil cooler and associated gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic Automatic Transmission**

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, particularly at lower speeds. Slipping or hesitation when accelerating.
    * Solution: Torque converter replacement. In some cases, a transmission rebuild may be necessary if the issue has caused internal damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, or getting stuck in a particular gear. The transmission may also exhibit harsh downshifts.
    * Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild. Flushing the transmission fluid and filter replacement may help in some cases, but is typically a short-term fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive sagging in the rear suspension, particularly when loaded. Reduced ride height, poor handling, and potential clunking noises from the rear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs. Upgrading to heavy-duty springs may be recommended for vehicles that frequently carry heavy loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, ABS light, or other warning lights. Symptoms will vary depending on the specific sensor that has failed (e.g., mass airflow sensor, oxygen sensor, wheel speed sensor).
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor (depending on the sensor and labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Module Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting in cold weather, rough idling, excessive smoke from the exhaust. Check engine light may illuminate.
    * Solution: Replacement of the glow plug module and potentially the glow plugs themselves.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, either manually or with the power assist feature. The door may become stuck or require excessive force to operate.
    * Solution: Lubrication of the door tracks and rollers. Adjustment of the door alignment. Replacement of worn or damaged rollers, cables, or the power assist motor if applicable.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue and whether parts need to be replaced).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no air blowing from the vents. The blower motor may also make unusual noises before failing completely.
    * Solution: Replacement of the HVAC blower motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500XD, while capable and versatile, can present owners with several reliability concerns. Engine-related issues such as DPF clogging, EGR valve failure, and oil leaks are common and can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the torque converter and valve body, also contribute to potential expenses. Electrical gremlins, including sensor failures and glow plug module malfunctions, further add to the list of potential headaches. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant downtime and repair bills. The severity of these problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. Buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their ownership expectations.
