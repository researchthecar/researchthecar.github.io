The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Viano, also known as the Vito in some markets, is a versatile van known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and practicality. It was offered with a range of diesel engines, including the 2.1L CDI and 3.0L CDI V6. Power output varied depending on the specific engine tune. The 2.1L could be found with outputs around 136 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque. The 3.0L offered a more substantial 224 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Viano's spaciousness and suitability for carrying passengers or cargo. However, some common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical systems and certain engine components. The ride quality is also sometimes criticised for being somewhat firm, especially when the vehicle is unladen.
