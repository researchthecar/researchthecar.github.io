### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Viano, particularly with its diesel engines, presents a generally reliable platform, but potential owners should be aware of common issues. The CDI diesel engines can experience turbocharger, EGR, and DPF-related problems, while the automatic transmissions, especially the 7G-Tronic, may require attention to the valve body. Suspension components like air springs and bushings can wear over time. Electrical gremlins, often sensor-related or battery drain, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are largely robust, infotainment and climate control systems can occasionally develop faults. Proactive maintenance and addressing early symptoms are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
