### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz C320 is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The engine, particularly the 3.2L V6, can experience leaks from intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler seals, along with solenoid failures. The 5G-Tronic automatic transmission, while generally robust, can suffer from TCM or conductor plate problems. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also known to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster issues, are not uncommon. Exterior concerns include sunroof drain clogs and headlight condensation. Interior issues often revolve around HVAC components and display pixelation. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these potential repairs can add to the overall cost of ownership.
