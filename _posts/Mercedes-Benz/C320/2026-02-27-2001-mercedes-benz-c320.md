### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mercedes-Benz C320 offers a compelling package of luxury and performance, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 3.2L V6 engine can experience leaks from intake manifold gaskets and oil cooler seals, while the 5-speed automatic transmission may develop problems with its control module or conductor plate. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and instrument cluster issues, are also noted. Interior components like the headliner can sag over time, and the HVAC system's blower motor resistor is a common failure point. Despite these potential drawbacks, many C320s remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs of these specific known issues.
