### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz C320 (W203) is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 3.2L V6 engine can develop oil and coolant leaks, and the crankshaft position sensor is a known failure point. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can suffer from TCM or conductor plate problems leading to shifting issues. Suspension components like bushings and shocks may require attention due to age and mileage. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and the instrument cluster, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior headliners may sag. Despite these potential issues, proactive maintenance and addressing problems promptly can help maintain the C320's comfort and performance.
