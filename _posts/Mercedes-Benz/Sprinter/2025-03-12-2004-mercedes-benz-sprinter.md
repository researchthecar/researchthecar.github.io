The 2004 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, also known as the Dodge Sprinter in North America, is a versatile van popular for commercial and recreational use. The 2004 models primarily featured a 2.7L inline 5-cylinder diesel engine, producing around 154 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. A gasoline V6 was also available as an option. Owners often praise the Sprinter for its cargo capacity, fuel efficiency (for a van of its size, particularly with the diesel engine), and relatively high roof, enabling easier movement inside. Common complaints revolve around maintenance costs, parts availability, and some reliability issues, especially related to electrical components and diesel-specific parts.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline 5-Cylinder Diesel**

*   **Black Death (Injector Seal Leaks)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injector seals fail, allowing combustion gases to escape and form a black, tar-like substance around the injectors. This can lead to fuel leaks, poor engine performance, and eventual injector failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the copper injector seals and clean the affected area. In severe cases, the injectors themselves may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per injector depending on the extent of the damage and whether injectors need replacing.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the turbo, loss of power, excessive smoke, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Diagnose and address any underlying causes, such as oil starvation or foreign object damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, check engine light illumination, and potential stalling. Carbon buildup can cause the EGR valve to stick open or closed.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, while a practical and versatile van, can present owners with a range of issues. The diesel engine is prone to problems like injector seal leaks and turbocharger failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the SAM module and wiring harness, are also common. Suspension and transmission issues can add to the ownership expenses. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potentially high maintenance costs when considering a 2004 Sprinter. Pre-purchase inspections are strongly recommended.
