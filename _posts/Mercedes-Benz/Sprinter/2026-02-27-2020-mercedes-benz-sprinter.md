### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter demonstrates a commendable level of reliability, particularly in its chassis and exterior components. The primary areas requiring attention tend to be related to the diesel emissions systems (DPF, AdBlue) and certain electrical components like the infotainment screen and battery management. The V6 diesel, while powerful, has a history of glow plug and EGR issues that can manifest. The 4-cylinder diesel is generally robust but also susceptible to DPF regeneration problems. Transmission issues are infrequent but can involve leaks or software glitches. Overall, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights, the Sprinter remains a dependable workhorse.
