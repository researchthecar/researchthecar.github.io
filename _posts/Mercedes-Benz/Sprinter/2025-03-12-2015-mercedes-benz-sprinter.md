The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a versatile van popular for commercial use, conversions into campervans, and passenger transportation. It came with several engine options, including a 2.1L 4-cylinder diesel producing 161 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 diesel delivering 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.8L 4-cylinder gasoline engine rated at 154 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque. The 2.1L diesel was typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 diesel and gasoline options came with a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Sprinter's cargo capacity, fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel engines), and comfortable ride. Common dislikes include relatively high maintenance costs and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter can be a reliable and practical van, but it's not without its potential issues. Engine-related problems, particularly with the diesel engines (DPF, EGR, oil cooler), and transmission issues are among the most common and costly. Suspension and electrical problems, such as leaf spring sagging and sensor failures, can also occur. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant repair bills. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchasing.
