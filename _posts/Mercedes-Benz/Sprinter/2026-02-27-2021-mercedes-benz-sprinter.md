### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its chassis and body components. The primary areas that may require attention are related to the emissions control systems (DPF, AdBlue) on diesel engines and potential electronic glitches within the infotainment system. The V6 diesel engine, while powerful, has a slightly higher propensity for turbocharger and EGR issues compared to the 4-cylinder. The automatic transmission is generally robust, with most reported issues being minor leaks or software-related. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are recommended to ensure long-term dependability.
