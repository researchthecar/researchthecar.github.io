The 2007 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a versatile van popular for commercial and recreational use. In 2007, it was offered with two engine options: a 2.1L Inline-4 Turbo Diesel producing 154 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 Turbo Diesel producing 154 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter for its spacious cargo area, high roof, and fuel efficiency (especially the diesel models). Common complaints include relatively high maintenance costs, some electrical issues, and rust concerns (depending on the climate).

Engine problems, particularly with the turbocharger and fuel injectors in the 2.1L, and oil cooler leaks and EGR issues in the 3.0L, can be costly. Transmission issues like torque converter problems can also be expensive to address. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs and ball joints, may require attention over time. Electrical problems such as glow plug failure and wiring harness issues are also common. Rust can be a significant concern in certain climates. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potentially high maintenance costs when considering this vehicle.
