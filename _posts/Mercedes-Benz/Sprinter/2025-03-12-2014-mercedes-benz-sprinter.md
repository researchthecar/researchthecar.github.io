The 2014 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a popular cargo and passenger van known for its versatility and spaciousness. This model year offered several engine and transmission choices, including a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel engine producing 161 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter V6 diesel engine producing 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. A 1.8-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine producing 154 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque was also an option. The gasoline engine came paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while both diesels were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter for its high roof, cargo capacity, and fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel engines). However, some common complaints include the high cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as some electrical issues.
