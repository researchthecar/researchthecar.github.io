The 2006 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a versatile van popular for commercial use and camper conversions. For the 2006 model year, it was typically equipped with a 2.7L inline 5-cylinder diesel engine. This engine produced around 154 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. The 2006 model year has the OM647 engine. A common complaint with these vans is their susceptibility to rust, especially in areas with road salt. Owners often appreciate the Sprinter's high cargo capacity and fuel efficiency compared to traditional vans, but find the repair costs and parts availability challenging. The transmission options are the NAG1 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**OM647 2.7L Diesel**

*   **Black Death (Injector Seal Leaks)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injector seals fail, leading to carbon buildup around the injectors. This is also known as "Black Death." Symptoms include a strong diesel smell, hissing or chuffing noises from the engine bay, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the copper injector seals and cleaning of the injector wells. In severe cases, injectors may need to be replaced as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbo Resonator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbo resonator, a plastic component, is prone to cracking or failing. This results in a loss of boost pressure, reduced power, and a whistling noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbo resonator with an updated aftermarket part or a more durable metal version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**NAG1 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations felt during light acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This is often caused by worn-out torque converter fluid or a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush with the correct fluid specified for the transmission. If the flush doesnâ€™t work, replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush, $800 - $1500+ for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate inside the transmission can fail, leading to shifting problems, erratic gear changes, and the transmission going into limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the conductor plate and transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs are prone to sagging over time, especially with heavy loads. In some cases, the leaf springs can crack or break. Symptoms include reduced ride height, poor handling, and a bouncy ride.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per spring (depending on parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Glow plugs are essential for starting the diesel engine in cold weather. Faulty glow plugs can cause hard starting, excessive smoke, and a rough idle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty glow plug(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wiring harnesses, especially those exposed to the elements, can suffer from corrosion and damage. This can lead to various electrical issues, including sensor malfunctions, lighting problems, and starting issues.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the damaged wiring harness sections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sprinters are notorious for rusting, especially in areas with road salt. Common rust areas include the rocker panels, wheel arches, door seams, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, welding in new metal, and painting. Preventative measures include rustproofing and regular washing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**

**Summary**

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, while a capable and versatile van, is prone to several common issues. The most significant issues revolve around the engine, transmission, and rust. "Black Death" and turbo resonator failures are common for the OM647 engine. The NAG1 transmission can suffer from torque converter issues and conductor plate failure. Rust is a major concern, especially in colder climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, making it essential to thoroughly inspect any potential purchase and budget for potential maintenance.
