### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a workhorse that generally offers good reliability for its class. The diesel engines, particularly the 2.1L OM651 and 3.0L OM642, can experience issues like turbocharger problems, EGR valve faults, and oil cooler leaks, which are common in many modern diesels. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can arise but are often repairable. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are subject to wear due to the vehicle's load-carrying nature. Electrical gremlins and interior component wear, such as the sliding door mechanism and HVAC blower, are also noted. Proactive maintenance and addressing early symptoms are key to minimizing downtime and repair costs for this commercial van.
