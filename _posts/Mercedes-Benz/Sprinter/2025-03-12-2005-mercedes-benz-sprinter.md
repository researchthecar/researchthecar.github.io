The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a versatile cargo van appreciated for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency (particularly with the diesel engine), and robust build quality. It was popular among tradespeople and businesses needing a reliable work vehicle. However, owners have reported issues with rust, electrical problems, and specific engine components. The 2005 Sprinter typically came with a 2.7L inline-5 cylinder diesel engine producing around 154 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque or a 3.5L V6 gasoline engine producing around 214 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Dislikes often revolve around maintenance costs, specific parts availability, and certain model year quirks.

**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, while a capable van, has several common issues. The diesel engine is prone to turbocharger, injector, glow plug, and EGR problems. The gasoline engine can leak oil and coolant. The transmission may experience torque converter and valve body failures. Suspension issues include leaf spring sag and worn ball joints. Electrically, wiring harness issues and ABS module failures are not uncommon. Rust is a significant concern, especially in areas with harsh weather. The HVAC blower and power windows sometimes fail. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars depending on the problem. Rust repair is a particularly variable cost.
