### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a capable and generally reliable commercial vehicle. Its strengths lie in its robust powertrain options and durable chassis. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as diesel engine component failures (glow plugs, turbochargers, injectors, DPFs), transmission problems (especially with automatics), and electrical system vulnerabilities like wiring harness corrosion. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, can also require attention. Rust is a significant concern for vehicles operating in harsh climates. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the Sprinter can remain a dependable asset for many years.
