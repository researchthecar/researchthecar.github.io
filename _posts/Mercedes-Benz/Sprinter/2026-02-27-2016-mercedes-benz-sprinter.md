### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a workhorse van that generally offers good reliability for its class. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the diesel emissions systems (DPF and AdBlue) on the OM651 engine, and turbocharger or glow plug issues on the OM642. Transmission issues, while not widespread, can occur and often involve the torque converter or fluid leaks. Electrical gremlins, particularly sensor malfunctions and battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components like leaf springs can wear under heavy use. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing warning lights promptly are key to maintaining the Sprinter's operational efficiency and longevity.
