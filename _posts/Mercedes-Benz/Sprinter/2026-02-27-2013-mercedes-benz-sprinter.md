### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a workhorse van with a generally solid reputation for reliability. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the diesel particulate filter (DPF) and AdBlue systems on the OM651 engine, and glow plug or turbocharger concerns on the OM642. Automatic transmission issues, though not widespread, can occur, primarily related to the torque converter or TCM. Suspension components like leaf springs and general electrical issues, such as wiring harness faults and alternator failures, are also noted. Proactive maintenance, especially for emissions systems, and prompt attention to any warning lights are recommended to ensure long-term dependability.
