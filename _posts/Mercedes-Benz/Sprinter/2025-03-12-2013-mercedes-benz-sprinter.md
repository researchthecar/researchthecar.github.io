The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a versatile van favored for its cargo capacity, fuel efficiency (especially in the diesel models), and relatively comfortable ride. It comes in various configurations, including cargo van, passenger van, and chassis cab, catering to a wide range of needs from commercial to recreational. The 2013 Sprinter offered two engine options: a 2.1L four-cylinder diesel (OM651) producing 161 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 diesel (OM642) that generates 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. The 2.1L diesel engine was typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC), while the 3.0L V6 diesel usually came with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter's fuel economy, especially the diesel models, as well as its spacious interior and cargo capacity. Some common complaints include higher maintenance costs compared to domestic vans, electrical issues, and potential for rust in certain climates.
