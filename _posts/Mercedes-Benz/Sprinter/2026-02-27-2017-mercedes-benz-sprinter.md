### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a workhorse van that generally offers good reliability for its class. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the diesel emissions systems (DPF, AdBlue) and specific engine components like turbochargers, particularly on the larger 3.0L engine. Transmission issues, while not widespread, can be costly if the torque converter fails. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can wear under heavy use. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain, are also noted. Routine maintenance and addressing warning lights promptly are crucial for maximizing the longevity and minimizing unexpected repair costs of the Sprinter.
