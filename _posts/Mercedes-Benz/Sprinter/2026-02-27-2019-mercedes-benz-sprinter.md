### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter demonstrates a commendable level of reliability, particularly for its class. The diesel engines, while generally robust, can encounter specific issues related to emissions systems (AdBlue) and turbochargers, especially with higher mileage or less diligent maintenance. The automatic transmission is mostly reliable, though occasional electronic control module problems can arise. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are the most commonly cited non-mechanical issues. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically durable. Overall, the Sprinter is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential AdBlue system and turbocharger maintenance needs for the diesel variants.
