### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, particularly models equipped with the 2.7L CDI engine, can be a reliable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential issues with the glow plug system, turbocharger, and fuel injectors. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic, can arise, focusing on the torque converter and TCM. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints may require attention due to the vehicle's load-carrying nature. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are also documented. Exterior rust can be a significant concern depending on climate and maintenance. Overall, while not immune to problems, many Sprinters continue to serve well with proper maintenance and timely repairs of these common issues.
