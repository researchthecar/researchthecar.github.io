The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a popular cargo and passenger van known for its versatility and spaciousness. It was offered with a few different engine options. The most common are the 2.1L four-cylinder diesel engine (OM651) producing around 161 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.0L V6 diesel engine (OM642) which produces around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. A gasoline 2.0L four-cylinder was also available. Most models were equipped with a 5-speed automatic transmission, though a 7-speed was optional with certain engines. Owners often appreciate the Sprinter's high roof options, which allow for standing room, and its payload capacity. Common complaints include its relatively high purchase price and maintenance costs.
