### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a capable and durable van, but potential buyers and owners should be aware of common issues. Diesel engine variants, particularly the 3.0L V6, can experience DPF and EGR problems. Transmission issues, such as fluid leaks and torque converter problems in automatics, are also noted. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints may require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can arise. Rust is a concern for exterior panels, especially in corrosive environments. While not overwhelmingly problematic, addressing these potential issues proactively can ensure the longevity and reliability of the Sprinter.
