The 2009 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a versatile van popular for commercial and recreational use. It was available with two primary engine options: a 3.0L V6 diesel and a 3.5L V6 gasoline engine, both paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0L diesel produces around 154 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, high roof options, and fuel efficiency for its size. Common complaints include the cost of maintenance, some reliability issues, and specific components that are prone to failure.
