The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a versatile cargo van known for its spacious interior, high roof options, and diesel engine fuel economy. Available engines included a 2.1L four-cylinder diesel (161 hp, 265 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L V6 diesel (188 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sprinter's cargo capacity and functionality, but common complaints often revolve around reliability issues, particularly with emissions control systems, and higher maintenance costs compared to other vans.
