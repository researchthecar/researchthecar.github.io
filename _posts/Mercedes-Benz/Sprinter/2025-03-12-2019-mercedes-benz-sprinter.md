The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a popular choice for commercial use and van conversions, offering a blend of practicality, comfort, and Mercedes-Benz refinement. This model year offered several engine options, including a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder gasoline engine producing 188 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L turbodiesel V6 producing 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbodiesel 4-cylinder engine, which came in multiple power outputs. The transmissions included a 7-speed automatic and a 9-speed automatic, depending on the engine and configuration. Owners often praise the Sprinter's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively good fuel economy for its size. However, common complaints revolve around the cost of maintenance, the complexity of the electronics, and certain reliability issues.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbodiesel V6**

* **DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated with codes related to the DEF system. This can include issues with the DEF injector, DEF tank sensor, or the DEF pump. Reduced engine power or a "countdown" to engine shutdown may occur.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty DEF system component (injector, sensor, pump) or cleaning/flushing the system. In some cases, a software update may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often from the oil cooler seals or the rear main seal. Visible oil on the ground under the vehicle or oil residue on the engine components.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking seals or gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the source of the leak and the labor involved.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Turbodiesel 4-Cylinder**

* **No Issues Found**

**2.0L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder Gasoline**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (7G-TRONIC)**

* **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. Transmission may slip or hesitate when accelerating.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid change) - $2000+ (valve body replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**9-Speed Automatic (9G-TRONIC)**

* **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Sagging (Especially on heavier models or those with conversions)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sits noticeably lower than the front, especially when loaded. This can affect ride quality and handling.
    * Solution: Upgrading the rear springs, adding air suspension, or installing helper springs to provide additional support.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the solution chosen.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination with various diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to different sensors (e.g., oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, wheel speed sensors).
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor depending on the location and type.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, malfunctioning sensors, or issues with the infotainment system. Often caused by chafed or damaged wiring harnesses, particularly in areas exposed to the elements or engine heat.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the damaged wiring harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the damage and the location of the harness.
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Solution: Replacing the rollers, repairing or replacing the tracks, or adjusting/replacing the latch mechanism.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the severity and parts needing replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced airflow, inconsistent temperature, or failure of the air conditioning or heating system. Can be caused by a faulty blower motor, a clogged cabin air filter, or a refrigerant leak.
    * Solution: Replacing the blower motor, replacing the cabin air filter, or repairing the refrigerant leak and recharging the system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter can be a reliable and versatile vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the DEF system on the diesel models, potential oil leaks, sliding door issues, and electrical issues. The cost to repair these issues can vary significantly depending on the specific problem and the parts required. While some problems can be relatively inexpensive to fix, others may require more extensive repairs and higher costs. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are recommended.
