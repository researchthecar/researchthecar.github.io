The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a popular choice for commercial use and conversion vans, appreciated for its spaciousness, versatility, and payload capacity. The 2016 model year offered several engine options: a 2.1L four-cylinder diesel (OM651) producing 161 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 diesel (OM642) generating 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. A 188 horsepower 258 lb-ft of torque 2.0L four-cylinder gasoline engine was also available. The diesel engines were typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic Plus), while the gasoline engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. While owners praise its durability and cargo capacity, common complaints include the cost of maintenance, diesel emissions system issues, and some electrical gremlins.

**Summary**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, while generally reliable, does experience some common issues. The diesel engines are prone to emission control system problems (DPF, EGR) and oil leaks, which can be costly to repair. The transmission can also have issues with the torque converter. Electrical problems such as sensor failures and door lock actuators are reported. The sliding door and HVAC blower motor also present common problems. Overall, while no widespread catastrophic failures plague the 2016 Sprinter, potential repair costs can be high, especially with diesel engine-related issues, which should be carefully considered when purchasing a used model.
