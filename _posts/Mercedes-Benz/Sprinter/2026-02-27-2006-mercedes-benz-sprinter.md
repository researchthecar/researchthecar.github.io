### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a capable workhorse, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The diesel engines, particularly the 2.7L CDI, can experience problems with glow plugs, injectors, and turbochargers, while the 3.0L V6 may face EGR and intake manifold issues. Transmission reliability is generally good, but automatic torque converters and manual clutches can require attention. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are susceptible to wear. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior rust, particularly in harsh climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor and instrument cluster are also areas to inspect. Proactive maintenance and addressing these known issues can significantly enhance the long-term reliability of the 2006 Sprinter.
