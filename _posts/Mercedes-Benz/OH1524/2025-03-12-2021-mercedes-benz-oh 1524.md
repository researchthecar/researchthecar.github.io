The 2021 Mercedes-Benz OH 1524 is a bus chassis, commonly used in Latin America and other regions for public transportation. It is powered by the Mercedes-Benz OM 924 LA engine. The OM 924 LA is a 4.8-liter four-cylinder turbodiesel engine producing around 218 horsepower and approximately 600 lb-ft of torque depending on the configuration. While known for its reliability and fuel efficiency, potential downsides can include the specific maintenance requirements of diesel engines and the challenges of sourcing parts in some regions. Some owners appreciate the robust chassis and suitability for demanding road conditions, while others have cited concerns about ride comfort and noise levels.

**Engine**

**OM 924 LA (4.8L Turbodiesel)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased power, increased fuel consumption, and black smoke from the exhaust. Can lead to engine misfires and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s) and potentially recalibration of the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector (depending on labor and parts availability)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the engine, loss of power, black smoke, and potential engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the turbocharger for damaged impeller blades, worn bearings, or leaks. Replacement or rebuild of the turbocharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ (depending on whether it's a rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, decreased power, poor fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve. Inspection of the EGR cooler for clogging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension System Leaks (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle leaning to one side, uneven ride height, the air compressor running constantly, and a noticeable hissing sound.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the air springs, air lines, and compressor for leaks. Replacement of damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per air spring (depending on part and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A wide range of issues depending on the failed sensor, including engine performance problems, ABS malfunctions, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the faulty sensor and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor (depending on the sensor type and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting (in areas with high humidity or salt exposure)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust spots on the chassis, body panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Sanding, rust treatment, and repainting the affected areas. Application of rustproofing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the extent of the rust damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*No Issues Found*

**Summary:**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz OH 1524 bus chassis, while generally reliable, can experience issues common to diesel engines, such as fuel injector failures and turbocharger problems, which can be relatively costly to repair. Air suspension issues are also possible, potentially adding to the overall maintenance expense. Rusting can be a concern in certain environments. While the OM 924 LA engine offers a balance of power and efficiency, owners should be aware of the potential for these issues and factor them into their maintenance planning.
