### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz S400L, while a sophisticated luxury vehicle, presents a reliability profile that aligns with high-end German engineering. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to its advanced hybrid powertrain and the complex AIRMATIC air suspension system. Hybrid battery degradation and potential coolant leaks are noted engine-related issues. For the suspension, air strut leaks and compressor failures are the most common, though often repairable. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and auxiliary battery, can also arise. Despite these points, the core mechanical components and interior/exterior elements generally hold up well, reflecting the premium build quality expected of an S-Class. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the S400L's optimal performance and longevity.
