### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz ML500 offers a blend of luxury and utility, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 5.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but leaks from oil cooler seals and intake manifold gaskets can occur. Transmission problems, particularly with the 5G-Tronic, often involve the TCM or conductor plate, leading to shifting issues. The optional Airmatic suspension is a significant point of concern, with leaks in air springs and compressor failures being relatively common and costly repairs. Electrical components like window regulators and headlight ballasts can also require attention. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, specific components like heated seat elements can fail. Proactive maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended for this model.
