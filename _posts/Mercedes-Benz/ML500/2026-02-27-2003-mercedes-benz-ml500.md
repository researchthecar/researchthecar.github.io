### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz ML500 is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 5.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but ignition system components and oil leaks can occur. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while durable, can develop issues with its control module or conductor plate. Suspension, particularly the optional AIRMATIC system, is a frequent source of repair costs due to leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are not uncommon. Interior components like HVAC resistors and seat heaters can also fail. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining this vehicle's reliability and avoiding costly repairs.
