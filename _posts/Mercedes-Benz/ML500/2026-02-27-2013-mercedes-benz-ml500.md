### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz ML500 offers a generally robust ownership experience, with its powerful V8 engine and comfortable ride being key highlights. The most common reported issues tend to be concentrated in the AIRMATIC air suspension system, particularly leaks in air springs or compressor failures, which can be costly to repair. Powertrain reliability is good, though potential issues with timing chains and oil leaks from valve covers should be monitored. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment screen problems and parking sensor malfunctions, are also noted. For models equipped with standard steel suspension, reliability in that area is significantly higher. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the ML500's luxury and performance.
