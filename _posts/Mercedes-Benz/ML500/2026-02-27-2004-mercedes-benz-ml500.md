### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz ML500, while offering a premium experience, presents a mixed reliability profile typical of luxury SUVs of its era. The 5.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but common issues like ignition coil failures and oil cooler seal leaks can arise. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while capable, can experience issues with its control module and conductor plate. Suspension components, particularly the optional AIRMATIC system, are prone to leaks and failures, leading to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are also frequently reported. Exterior issues like clogged sunroof drains can lead to interior water damage. Overall, expect potential repair costs to be higher than average, and thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
