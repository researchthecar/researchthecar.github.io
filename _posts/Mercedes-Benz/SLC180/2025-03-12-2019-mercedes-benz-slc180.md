The 2019 Mercedes-Benz SLC180 is a sporty roadster known for its stylish design and retractable hardtop. The SLC180 features a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 156 horsepower and 250 Nm of torque. Other engine options for the 2019 SLC range include the SLC200, SLC300, and the AMG SLC43, offering varying degrees of performance. Transmission options typically include a 9-speed automatic. Owners often praise the SLC180 for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and enjoyable open-top driving experience. However, some criticisms include the relatively small trunk space, and some consider the base engine to be slightly underpowered compared to the higher-spec models.
