The 2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT R is a high-performance sports car known for its aggressive styling and track-focused capabilities. It boasts a handcrafted 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that produces 577 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While praised for its exhilarating performance, precise handling, and luxurious interior, some owners have reported experiencing certain issues. Some common complaints revolve around the car's stiff ride, limited practicality for daily use, and the potential for high maintenance costs.

    *   Description/Symptoms: The AMG GT R utilizes an adaptive damping system that allows for adjustable ride stiffness. Some owners have reported failures within this system, leading to a harsh or uneven ride, as well as error messages on the dashboard. This can stem from faulty sensors, actuators, or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty damper components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+ per damper
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensor failures can occur, including those related to the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), oxygen sensors, and other engine management sensors. These failures can trigger warning lights on the dashboard and potentially affect vehicle performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on location and type.
