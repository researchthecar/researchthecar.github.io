The 2019 Mercedes-Benz C43 AMG, also affectionately (and fictitiously) known as the Toreto 45, is a performance-oriented compact executive car. Since this model is fictional, let's assume it's heavily based on the existing C43 AMG and has the M276 3.0L Biturbo V6 engine producing around 385 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. While some appreciate the car's powerful engine, sporty handling, and luxurious interior, others may find the ride a bit harsh and the infotainment system complex. The vehicle also comes equipped with a 9G-Tronic 9-speed automatic transmission.
