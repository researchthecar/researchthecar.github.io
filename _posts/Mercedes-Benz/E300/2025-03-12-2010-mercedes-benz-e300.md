The 2010 Mercedes-Benz E300 was sold in some markets outside of the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia. It was generally appreciated for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and overall build quality. Some common complaints included the relatively high cost of maintenance and repairs, and some found the base engine to be underpowered for the vehicle's size. The E300 was equipped with a 3.0-liter V6 engine that produces approximately 231 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2010 E-Class included various gasoline and diesel engines, depending on the market. All engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC).

**Summary**

The 2010 Mercedes-Benz E300 can experience a range of issues, some of which can be costly to repair. Engine issues, particularly with the camshaft adjusters and intake manifold, and transmission problems with the torque converter and valve body, are prevalent. Electrical issues with the EIS and SAM modules can also be problematic. If the car is equipped with the Airmatic suspension, failures can lead to very high repair costs. While the E300 is a comfortable and well-built vehicle, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate to severe, with repair costs potentially exceeding several thousand dollars depending on the specific problem and the need for specialized Mercedes-Benz technicians.
