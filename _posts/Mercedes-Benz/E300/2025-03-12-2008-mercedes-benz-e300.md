Owners appreciate the car's refined driving experience and build quality but sometimes complain about the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 (M272)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly develop from the valve cover gaskets or the oil filter housing gasket. Symptoms include oil spots on the ground, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets or oil filter housing gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on location.

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft adjuster solenoid can fail, leading to rough idling, poor performance, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

*   **Balance Shaft Sprocket Wear (Early Production M272 Engines)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While more prevalent in earlier years of the M272 engine, there's a chance it can affect a 2008 model. Worn balance shaft sprockets cause rough running, misfires, and eventually, a check engine light. This is a serious issue as it can lead to engine damage.
    *   Solution: Requires extensive engine disassembly and replacement of the balance shaft sprocket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (7G-Tronic - 722.9)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 722.9 transmission can experience torque converter shudder or failure. Symptoms include vibrations, hesitation during acceleration, and rough shifting.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. Sometimes a software update can mitigate shudder in earlier stages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+

*   **Valve Body Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Valve body malfunctions can lead to harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, or complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with Airmatic (air suspension), problems can arise with the air struts, compressor, or valve block. Symptoms include sagging suspension, uneven ride height, excessive compressor noise, and "car too low" warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty air struts, compressor, or valve block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut; $500 - $1,500+ for compressor; $300-$800+ for valve block.

*   **Suspension Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings) can wear out, leading to clunking noises, imprecise handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner.

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EIS, also known as the ignition switch, can fail, preventing the car from starting. Symptoms include key not being recognized, no response when turning the key, and dashboard lights not illuminating.
    *   Solution: EIS replacement and reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: SAM units control various electrical functions. Failure can lead to issues with lights, wipers, windows, or other electrical components.
    *   Solution: SAM unit replacement and programming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Specific Regions/Conditions)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In regions with heavy road salt usage or high humidity, rust can develop, particularly around wheel wells, door edges, and underbody.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, body panel replacement, and rustproofing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the severity.

**Interior**

*   **Command System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The COMAND system (infotainment) can experience various problems, including screen malfunctions, software glitches, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates, component replacement (screen, head unit).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the issue and component.

*   **Sunroof Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroofs can experience motor failure, track misalignment, or water leaks.
    *   Solution: Sunroof motor replacement, track repair, or drainage cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
