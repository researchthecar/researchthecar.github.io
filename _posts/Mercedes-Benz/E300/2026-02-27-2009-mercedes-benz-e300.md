### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz E300 (W211) is a capable luxury sedan with a generally good reliability record for its age. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the M272 V6 engine's balance shaft and intake manifold, and potential failures within the 5G-TRONIC transmission's conductor plate. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM unit, can also arise. Suspension components, especially if equipped with air suspension, may require attention. While these potential issues exist, they are not universal, and many E300s have been maintained well and continue to provide reliable service. Regular maintenance and addressing early warning signs are key to a positive ownership experience.
