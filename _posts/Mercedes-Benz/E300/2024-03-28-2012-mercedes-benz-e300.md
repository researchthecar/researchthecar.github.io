    * **Solution:** Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    * **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500-$1,000
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** This can lead to a loud rattling noise on startup, reduced engine power, and potential engine damage.
    * **Solution:** Replace the timing chain tensioner.
    * **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000-$2,500
* **Intake manifold runner issues:** Malfunctioning intake manifold runners may cause rough idling, reduced fuel efficiency, and hesitation during acceleration.
    * **Solution:** Replace the intake manifold runners.
    * **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500-$1,500

**Transmission**

**Seven-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission shudder:** Rough or jerky shifting, especially when changing from second to third gear.
    * **Solution:** Replace or reprogram the transmission control module (TCM).

**Suspension**

* **Coil spring failure:** Broken or weakened coil springs can lead to a bumpy ride, instability in handling, and uneven tire wear.
    * **Solution:** Replace the coil springs.
    * **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500-$1,000 per axle
* **Air suspension malfunctions:** Problems with the air suspension system, such as leaks, compressor failure, or sensor issues, can affect ride height and handling.
    * **Solution:** Repair or replace the air suspension components.
    * **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000-$3,000+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery may drain rapidly, even when the car is parked.
    * **Solution:** Identify and fix the source of the electrical drain, which could be a faulty component or a parasitic electrical load.
    * **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100-$500
* **Electrical glitches:** Malfunctioning sensors, modules, or wiring can cause various electrical issues, including erratic instrument readings, malfunctioning lights, or engine problems.
    * **Solution:** Diagnose and repair the specific electrical fault.
    * **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200-$1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Rust on brake rotors:** Rust buildup on the brake rotors can cause brake noise and reduced braking performance.
    * **Solution:** Clean or replace the brake rotors.
