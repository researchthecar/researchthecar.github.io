### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz E300 offers a luxurious driving experience, but like many premium vehicles of its era, it is not immune to specific technical issues. The most commonly cited problems revolve around the engine, particularly the intake manifold runner flap failure and balance shaft gear wear on the gasoline V6, and DPF issues on the diesel variants. Transmission issues, such as torque converter seal leaks and valve body malfunctions, can also arise. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM unit, can manifest in various ways. While suspension components can wear, air suspension systems (if equipped) are prone to leaks. Interior electronics like seat actuators and infotainment systems can also develop faults. Despite these potential issues, many owners report satisfaction with the vehicle's overall comfort and performance when properly maintained. Addressing these known problem areas proactively can help ensure long-term reliability.
