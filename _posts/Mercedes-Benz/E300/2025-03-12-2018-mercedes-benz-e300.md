**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M274)**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit rough idling, decreased power, or illuminated check engine light. Fault codes P0011 or P0014 might be present. This is often attributed to the camshaft adjuster solenoid malfunctioning, preventing proper oil flow to the camshaft adjusters (phasers).
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Extended cranking, rough idling, loss of power, or engine stalling. A distinct clicking or ticking noise might be audible from the engine bay. Diagnostic trouble codes related to fuel pressure or fuel delivery might be stored.
    *   Solution: Replace the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic (725.0)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or harsh shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. The transmission might hesitate or delay shifting, leading to an unresponsive feeling.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission adaptation reset using a diagnostic scan tool. If the issue persists, inspect the valve body for wear or damage. Valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Adaptation reset: $100-$200. Valve body replacement: $1500 - $3000+. Transmission rebuild: $4000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Fluid Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible transmission fluid leaks underneath the vehicle, often near the transmission pan or around the transmission cooler lines. Low transmission fluid levels can lead to slipping or erratic shifting.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak (pan gasket, cooler lines, seals) and replace the faulty component. Ensure proper transmission fluid level after repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ (depending on the source of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped with Airmatic)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging or uneven ride height, especially after being parked overnight. The air suspension compressor might run continuously or fail to engage. "Visit Workshop" warning message related to the suspension may appear.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air suspension compressor. Also, inspect the air struts for leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ (compressor replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **COMAND Infotainment System Issues**
