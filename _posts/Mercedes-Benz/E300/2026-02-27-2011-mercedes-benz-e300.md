### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz E300, while offering a premium experience, is not immune to potential reliability concerns. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the engine, particularly the intake manifold runner flap failures and balance shaft gear wear on the M272 V6 engines, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as torque converter seal leaks and valve body problems with the 7G-TRONIC, are also noted.
