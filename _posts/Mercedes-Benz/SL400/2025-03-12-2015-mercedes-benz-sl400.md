The 2015 Mercedes-Benz SL400 is a luxurious roadster known for its retractable hardtop, comfortable ride, and elegant styling. The SL400 is equipped with a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 engine producing 329 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic Plus). Some owners appreciate the car's comfortable cruising abilities and sophisticated features, while others find the maintenance costs to be high and the technology to be slightly dated compared to newer models. Some may not enjoy the soft suspension or the less than sporty driving feel. The SL lineup also included the SL550, SL63 AMG, and SL65 AMG which came with V8 and V12 engine options.
