The 2015 Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive grand tourer known for its iconic gullwing doors and powerful performance. The SLS AMG was available with only one engine option: a naturally aspirated 6.2-liter V8 engine producing 583 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners generally appreciate the SLS AMG for its stunning design, exhilarating performance, and unique driving experience. However, some common complaints include the limited visibility, especially when parking, the firm ride, and the relatively high running costs.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8 (M159)**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise, rough idle, loss of power, and potentially engine stalling. The camshaft adjuster units can wear prematurely, leading to improper valve timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected camshaft adjuster units and related components (timing chain, guides, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noise from the engine, especially when cold. Worn valve lifters can cause excessive valve train noise and potentially lead to further engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty valve lifters. This is often done in conjunction with camshaft replacement as wear on one typically leads to wear on the other.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil drips under the car, burning oil smell, and low oil level. Common leak points include valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch (DCT)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Jerky or abrupt shifts, especially at low speeds. Hesitation or delay when accelerating. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, a faulty valve body, or software issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and potential repair or replacement of the clutch packs, valve body, or transmission control module (TCM). A software update may also resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $10,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving without corresponding acceleration, or a feeling of the transmission slipping out of gear. This can be caused by worn clutch packs or internal transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting low on one or more corners, rough ride, "Suspension Fault" warning light. Common causes include leaks in the air struts or air lines, a faulty air compressor, or a malfunctioning ride height sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty air strut, air compressor, ride height sensor, or air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ (per strut, compressor, or sensor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car battery frequently dying, especially after sitting for a few days. Possible causes include a parasitic drain from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the source of the parasitic drain and repair or replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gullwing Door Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gullwing doors not opening or closing properly, unusual noises when operating the doors, or failure of the door locking mechanisms.
    *   Solution: Inspection and repair or replacement of the door actuators, sensors, hinges, or locking mechanisms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Gullwing Door Seal Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Wind noise or water leaks around the gullwing doors. The seals can become brittle or damaged over time, leading to poor sealing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Delamination/Melting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sticky or melting dashboard surface, particularly in hot climates. The plastic or coating on the dashboard can degrade over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard or repair of the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2015 Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, while a desirable and high-performing vehicle, can suffer from some potentially expensive issues. Engine-related problems such as camshaft adjuster and valve lifter wear are common and costly to address. Transmission issues, particularly with the dual-clutch system, can also be significant. Electrical and suspension issues may arise, potentially leading to further expenses. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their ownership costs. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Mercedes-Benz mechanic is highly recommended.
