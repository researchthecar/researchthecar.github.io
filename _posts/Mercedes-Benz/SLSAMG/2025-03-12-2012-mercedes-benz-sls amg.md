The 2012 Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG is a hand-built, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive grand tourer coupe and roadster. It is powered by a naturally aspirated 6.2-liter V8 engine producing 563 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The SLS AMG is celebrated for its iconic gullwing doors (on the coupe), powerful engine, and distinctive styling.
