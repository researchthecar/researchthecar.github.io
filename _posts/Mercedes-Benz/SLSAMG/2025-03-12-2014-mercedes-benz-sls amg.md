The 2014 Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive grand tourer known for its iconic gullwing doors and powerful performance. It was offered in coupe and roadster variants. The SLS AMG is powered by a hand-built 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 583 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. A seven-speed dual-clutch transmission sends power to the rear wheels. The SLS AMG is celebrated for its stunning design, exhilarating acceleration, and distinctive exhaust note. However, some owners have reported issues ranging from minor annoyances to more significant mechanical problems. Common complaints often include concerns regarding the transmission, suspension, and electrical systems.
