### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG is a highly capable supercar with a generally robust mechanical foundation. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to its complex dual-clutch transmission, particularly the mechatronics unit and clutch packs, which can be costly to repair. The adaptive suspension and certain electrical components, like the infotainment system and potential battery drain issues, also warrant attention. While the powerful V8 engine is largely reliable, maintenance of its specialized dry-sump lubrication system is critical. Exterior carbon fiber components may show signs of wear over time. Overall, the SLS AMG offers a thrilling ownership experience, but potential buyers should budget for specialized maintenance and potential repairs common to high-performance exotics.
