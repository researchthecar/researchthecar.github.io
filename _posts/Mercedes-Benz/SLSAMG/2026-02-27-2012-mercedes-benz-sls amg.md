### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG is a remarkable supercar with a generally robust mechanical foundation, particularly its potent V8 engine. However, its complexity and high-performance nature mean that certain components, such as the dual-clutch transmission's mechatronics unit and clutch packs, and the adaptive suspension dampers, can be expensive to repair if they fail. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, and potential issues with the unique gullwing door mechanism are also noted. Owners should be prepared for higher maintenance and repair costs compared to less exotic vehicles, with a focus on regular servicing and prompt attention to any developing issues to maintain its performance and value.
