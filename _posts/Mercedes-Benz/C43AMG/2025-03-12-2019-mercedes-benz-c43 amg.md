The 2019 Mercedes-Benz C43 AMG is a performance-oriented version of the C-Class sedan, coupe, and convertible. It is powered by a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 385 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-Tronic 9-speed automatic transmission. Some owners love the C43 AMG for its blend of performance and luxury, its sporty handling, and its updated styling for the 2019 model year. Common complaints include a somewhat firm ride, especially on rough roads, and the infotainment system can be complex to use. Other engine options available on the C-Class include a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4, a 3.0L Turbocharged V6 (C43 AMG), a 4.0L Turbocharged V8 (C63 AMG), and a plug-in hybrid option.
