The 2023 Mercedes-Benz C43 AMG is a performance sedan that blends luxury with sporty driving dynamics. Its standout feature is its turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine paired with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. This combination delivers 402 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. There are no other engine options for the 2023 C43 AMG. This power is routed through a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the C43 for its responsive engine, agile handling, and luxurious interior. Some criticisms include a somewhat firm ride, and complex infotainment system that can be distracting.
