The 2024 Mercedes-Benz C43 AMG is a performance-oriented sedan that bridges the gap between the standard C-Class and the full-blown AMG C63. It boasts a handcrafted 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, producing 402 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels via a 9-speed AMG Speedshift MCT transmission. Many appreciate the C43 for its blend of performance and everyday usability, along with its luxurious interior and advanced technology. Some criticisms include a somewhat firm ride, the lack of a traditional V6 or V8 engine, and the potential for higher running costs associated with AMG models.

**Summary**

The 2024 Mercedes-Benz C43 AMG, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, has reported issues. Engine issues, such as turbocharger and high-pressure fuel pump failures, can be costly, with repairs potentially exceeding several thousand dollars. Transmission problems, particularly rough shifting, can often be resolved with a software update, but more severe cases may necessitate valve body replacement. Suspension issues are common in cars with air suspension. Electrical glitches, primarily related to the infotainment system and sensors, are also reported. Interior rattles can be a nuisance. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially major mechanical failures, and the cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the problem.
