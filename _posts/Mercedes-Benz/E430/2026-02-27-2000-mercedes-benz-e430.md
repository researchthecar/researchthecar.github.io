### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mercedes-Benz E430 (W210) offers a compelling mix of V8 power and luxury. While its core powertrain is generally reliable, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as ignition coil and MAF sensor problems in the engine, and conductor plate issues in the 5-speed automatic transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and instrument clusters, are also noted. Exterior rust, especially on fenders, and interior display pixelation are age-related concerns. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and addressing these specific issues, the E430 can remain a comfortable and capable luxury sedan.
