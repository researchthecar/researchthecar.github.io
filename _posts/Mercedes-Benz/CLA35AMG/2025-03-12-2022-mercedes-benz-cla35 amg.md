The 2022 Mercedes-Benz CLA35 AMG is a performance-oriented compact sedan that blends sporty driving dynamics with luxurious features. Its primary engine option is a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 producing 302 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 7G 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Some owners appreciate its sleek design, powerful engine, and advanced technology, while others find the ride quality somewhat firm and the rear seat space limited. Common complaints also involve the complex infotainment system and the potential for some reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M260)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-ups between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms can include low oil level warnings on the dashboard.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update to the ECU (Engine Control Unit) can help manage oil consumption. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and necessary repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises (whining or screeching) from the engine bay, and potentially a check engine light. This could stem from faulty bearings or internal damage to the turbocharger.
    * Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 7G 7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of rough or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation during acceleration or delayed gear changes can also occur.
    *   Solution: A transmission control module (TCM) software update may resolve the issue. In some cases, clutch replacement or valve body repair might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $5,000+ (clutch replacement/valve body repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission clutches.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000-$6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Stiff Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CLA35 AMG is known for its firm suspension setup, which can result in a less comfortable ride, particularly on rough or uneven roads. This is more of a characteristic than a defect.
    *   Solution: There is no real solution aside from replacing the shocks to a more compliant version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from the dealer is the typical solution. In some cases, the entire head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alerts, intermittent functionality, or complete failure of various sensors around the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on location and complexity.
