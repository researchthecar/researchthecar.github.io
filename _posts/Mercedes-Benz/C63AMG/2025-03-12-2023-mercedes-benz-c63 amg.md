The 2023 Mercedes-Benz C63 S E Performance represents a significant departure from its predecessors, swapping the traditional V8 engine for a high-performance, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a plug-in hybrid system. This configuration produces a combined output of 671 horsepower and 752 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option is a 9-speed automatic. While enthusiasts appreciate the innovative technology and impressive power, some lament the loss of the V8 rumble and the added complexity of the hybrid system. Concerns have also surfaced regarding the long-term reliability of the hybrid powertrain and the associated maintenance costs.
