The 2010 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG is a high-performance variant of the W204 C-Class, known for its powerful naturally aspirated 6.2L V8 engine. This engine produces 451 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. While the C63 AMG is praised for its exhilarating performance, responsive handling, and distinctive exhaust note, some owners have reported various issues. One of the common complaints is the vehicle's fuel economy. The C63 was only available with the Mercedes-Benz 7G-TRONIC 7-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (also known as camshaft position actuator bolts) were made from a weaker material and were prone to shearing. This issue could cause the engine to run rough, trigger the check engine light, and, in severe cases, result in significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the original bolts with updated, higher-strength bolts is the recommended solution. Mercedes-Benz issued a service bulletin to address this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether the work is done at a dealer or independent shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The gaskets between the intake manifold and cylinder heads can degrade over time, leading to vacuum leaks. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased performance, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Valve Lifter Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking noise, especially noticeable when the engine is cold, can indicate worn or faulty valve lifters. This issue might be exacerbated by infrequent oil changes or the use of incorrect oil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected valve lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.

The 2010 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG, while offering exhilarating performance, can present owners with a range of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine, specifically the camshaft adjuster bolts and potential intake manifold leaks. Transmission issues related to the torque converter, valve body, and conductor plate can also be costly to address. Electrical problems, such as EIS and SAM module failures, can also occur. While some of the issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive to repair, making pre-purchase inspections and a thorough service history essential when considering a used C63 AMG.
