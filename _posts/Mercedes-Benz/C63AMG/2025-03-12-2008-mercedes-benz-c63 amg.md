**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, getting stuck in gear, or complete transmission failure. The conductor plate houses the transmission control unit (TCU) and sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the conductor plate and potentially the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, especially at low speeds.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension (if equipped) can develop leaks in the air struts or the air compressor can fail, leading to a saggy or uneven ride height.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts or air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,500 for the compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the car, or the key not being recognized by the ignition.
    *   Solution: Replacing the EIS module. Requires programming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM controls various electrical functions. Failures can cause issues with lights, wipers, and other electronic components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty SAM unit and programming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200

**Summary**

The 2008 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG is a desirable performance car, but it's essential to be aware of its potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the M156 engine's camshaft adjuster bolts, lifters, and intake manifold, which can lead to costly repairs. Transmission conductor plate failures and electrical issues with the EIS and SAM modules are also common. Suspension components, particularly the air suspension (if equipped), may require attention. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be severe and expensive. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with Mercedes-Benz vehicles and consider budgeting for potential repairs.
