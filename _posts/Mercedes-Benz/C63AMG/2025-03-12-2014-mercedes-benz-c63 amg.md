The 2014 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG is a performance-oriented compact executive car known for its powerful engine, sporty handling, and luxurious interior. It was available as a sedan, coupe, and wagon. The main attraction is the naturally aspirated 6.2L V8 engine, producing 451 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque in its standard configuration. An optional "P31" AMG Development Package increased output to 481 horsepower. All models came with a 7-speed AMG Speedshift MCT automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the car's exhilarating performance and distinctive engine sound but often complain about its relatively poor fuel economy and higher maintenance costs.
