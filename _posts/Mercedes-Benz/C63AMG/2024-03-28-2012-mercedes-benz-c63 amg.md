**Introduction:**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG is a high-performance variant of the C-Class sedan. It is powered by a naturally aspirated 6.2-liter V8 engine that produces 451 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. The C63 AMG comes standard with a 7-speed automatic transmission, and rear-wheel drive is standard with optional all-wheel drive. The C63 AMG is known for its exhilarating performance, luxurious interior, and aggressive styling. However, it has also been plagued by several issues that have affected its reliability and reputation.

**Engine**

**6.2-Liter V8 Engine**

* **Connecting Rod Bearing Failure:** The connecting rod bearings can fail, causing catastrophic engine damage. Symptoms include a knocking noise from the engine, reduced power, and eventually engine seizure. The solution is to replace the connecting rod bearings, which can cost $3,000-$5,000.
* **Intake Manifold Runner Failure:** The intake manifold runners can fail, causing a loss of power and poor fuel economy. Symptoms include a rough idle, hesitation on acceleration, and reduced throttle response. The solution is to replace the intake manifold runners, which can cost $1,000-$2,000.
* **Valve Stem Seal Failure:** The valve stem seals can fail, causing oil consumption and smoke from the exhaust. Symptoms include excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from the exhaust, and rough idle. The solution is to replace the valve stem seals, which can cost $2,000-$3,000.
* **Secondary Air Injection Pump Failure:** The secondary air injection pump can fail, causing reduced power and increased emissions. Symptoms include a lack of power, especially at low speeds, and increased emissions levels. The solution is to replace the secondary air injection pump, which can cost $500-$1,000.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing a rattling noise from the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, rough idle, and reduced power. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner, which can cost $1,000-$2,000.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing slipping, shuddering, and loss of power. Symptoms include slipping gears, shuddering during acceleration, and reduced power. The solution is to replace the torque converter, which can cost $2,000-$3,000.
* **Solenoid Valve Failure:** The solenoid valves can fail, causing shifting problems and transmission shudder. Symptoms include delayed or harsh shifting, difficulty shifting gears, and transmission shudder. The solution is to replace the solenoid valves, which can cost $500-$1,000.
* **Clutch Pack Failure:** The clutch packs can fail, causing slipping and loss of power. Symptoms include slipping gears, reduced power, and difficulty shifting gears. The solution is to replace the clutch packs, which can cost $1,500-$2,500.
* **Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Failure:** The ECU can fail, causing a variety of transmission problems. Symptoms include erratic shifting, transmission shudder, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the ECU, which can cost $1,000-$2,000.

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Strut Failure:** The front suspension struts can fail, causing a loss of ride quality and handling. Symptoms include a rough ride, uneven tire wear, and difficulty steering. The solution is to replace the front suspension struts, which can cost $500-$1,000 each.
* **Rear Suspension Spring Failure:** The rear suspension springs can fail, causing a loss of ride quality and handling. Symptoms include a rough ride, uneven tire wear, and difficulty steering. The solution is to replace the rear suspension springs, which can cost $200-$500 each.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely, leaving the vehicle unable to start. Symptoms include a dead battery, difficulty starting the engine, and electrical problems. The solution is to identify and fix the source of the battery drain, which can vary in cost depending on the cause.
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, causing a loss of electrical power. Symptoms include a warning light on the dashboard, dim headlights, and difficulty starting the engine. The solution is to replace the alternator, which can cost $500-$1,000.
* **Starter Motor Failure:** The starter motor can fail, preventing the engine from starting. Symptoms include a clicking noise when trying to start the engine, no engine cranking, and difficulty starting the engine. The solution is to replace the starter motor, which can cost $500-$1,000.

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** The headlights can develop condensation, reducing visibility. Symptoms include condensation inside the headlights, especially after washing or in humid weather. The solution is to replace the headlight assembly, which can cost $500-$1,500 each.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Rattles:** The dashboard can develop rattles and squeaks, especially over rough roads. Symptoms include rattling or squeaking noises from the dashboard. The solution is to identify and fix the source of the rattle, which can vary in cost depending on the cause.
* **Seat Adjustment Failure:** The power seat adjustment can fail, preventing the driver from adjusting the seat. Symptoms include difficulty adjusting the seat, inoperable seat controls, and a stuck seat position. The solution is to repair or replace the seat adjustment mechanism, which can cost $500-$1,500.

**Summary:**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG is a powerful and luxurious performance car, but it has also been plagued by several issues that have affected its reliability and reputation. The engine, transmission, suspension, electrical, and interior systems have all been known to have problems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but they can be expensive to fix and can significantly impact the driving experience. It is important for potential buyers to be aware of these issues before purchasing a C63 AMG.
