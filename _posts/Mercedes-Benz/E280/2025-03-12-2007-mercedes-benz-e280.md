The 2007 Mercedes-Benz E280 is a luxury sedan that was part of the W211 E-Class generation. In addition to the E280, other engine options available included the E320 CDI (diesel), E350, E550, and the high-performance E63 AMG. The E280 was equipped with a 3.0L V6 gasoline engine that produced approximately 231 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. People generally liked the E-Class for its comfortable ride, elegant styling, and solid build quality. Common dislikes included higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles, and complex electronics that could sometimes be problematic.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 (M272)**

*   **Balance Shaft Sprocket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a very common issue affecting M272 engines produced within a certain range of years. The balance shaft sprocket wears prematurely, leading to rough running, misfires, and eventually engine failure if not addressed. Symptoms include a check engine light, often with codes P0016 or P0017 indicating a camshaft/crankshaft timing correlation issue.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the balance shaft with an updated version. This is a labor-intensive job requiring significant engine disassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+

*   **Intake Manifold Tumbler Flap Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold contains plastic flaps (tumbler flaps) that can break or disintegrate. This can cause rough idling, poor performance, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire intake manifold assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Variable Valve Timing Solenoid) Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the camshaft adjuster solenoids are common. A faulty solenoid can also cause poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate inside the 7G-Tronic transmission is a known weak point. It houses the transmission's electronic control unit (TCU) and speed sensors. Failure can cause erratic shifting, getting stuck in a gear, or complete loss of transmission function. Common symptoms include harsh shifting or delayed engagement. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to speed sensors or valve body malfunctions are common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the conductor plate and often the TCU as well. Sometimes the valve body is rebuilt or replaced at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body can wear and cause shifting problems, such as slipping between gears or harsh shifts.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Leaks/Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with the Airmatic air suspension, the air struts can develop leaks, causing the car to sag or sit unevenly. The air compressor can also fail due to overwork.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaking air struts and/or the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per strut; $500 - $1500+ for the compressor.

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front lower control arm bushings can wear out, leading to clunking noises, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EIS can fail, preventing the car from starting. This is a common issue with Mercedes-Benz vehicles of this era.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EIS, which requires programming to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM units control various electrical functions. They can fail due to water intrusion or electrical faults, leading to problems with lights, wipers, or other systems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected SAM unit and reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially around wheel wells and undercarriage)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop, particularly in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which can range from minor spot repairs to extensive panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+ (depending on severity)

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can fail, causing the sunroof to get stuck or operate erratically.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+

*   **Command System Issues (Navigation, Radio, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The COMAND system can experience various issues, including screen failures, navigation problems, and audio malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the COMAND unit or individual components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on the issue)

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz E280, while a comfortable and stylish vehicle, can suffer from a number of potentially costly issues. The balance shaft issue with the 3.0L V6 engine is a significant concern, as is the conductor plate failure in the 7G-Tronic transmission. Airmatic suspension problems (if equipped) and electrical issues with the EIS and SAM units can also be expensive to repair. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the cost of maintenance and repairs when considering purchasing this vehicle. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousands, depending on the severity and the required repairs.
