Some common complaints revolve around the cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as potential electrical issues that can plague older Mercedes-Benz models.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 (M272)**

*   **Balance Shaft Sprocket Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The balance shaft sprocket can wear prematurely, causing a check engine light, rough running, and potential engine damage if left unaddressed. Symptoms can start with timing-related error codes such as P0016 or P0017.
    *   Solution: Replacing the balance shaft sprocket, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Runner Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold runner motor can fail, leading to reduced performance and a check engine light. The vehicle may exhibit a lack of power, especially at lower RPMs. Error codes related to the intake manifold runners or actuator are common.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold runner motor or the entire intake manifold assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Cam Magnets) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the camshaft adjuster solenoids (often called cam magnets) are common. This can lead to oil contamination of the wiring harness and potentially damage other components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking camshaft adjuster solenoids and cleaning the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the extent of wiring harness contamination)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (7G-Tronic 722.9)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate inside the transmission can fail, leading to erratic shifting, limp mode, and a check engine light. Common symptoms include harsh shifting, being stuck in a gear, or the transmission not shifting at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the conductor plate and flushing the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the valve body can cause harsh shifting, slipping, and general transmission performance issues. This can be due to worn valves, solenoids, or other internal components.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with Airmatic suspension, the air struts or compressor can fail, leading to a sagging suspension, uneven ride height, and warning lights on the dash.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts or compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,500+ for the compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint/Control Arm Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn ball joints or control arm bushings can cause clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints or control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per corner.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EIS can fail, preventing the car from starting. This can manifest as the key not being recognized, the steering column not unlocking, or the car simply not responding when trying to start it.
    *   Solution: Replacing the EIS and potentially reprogramming it to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM modules control various electrical functions. Failures can lead to issues with lighting, wipers, windows, and other electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty SAM module and programming it to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Parasitic draw that drains the battery overnight or over a few days. The car may not start due to the battery being drained.
    * Solution: Locating the source of the parasitic draw (often related to a faulty module or component) and repairing or replacing it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000+ depending on the source of the draw.

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz E280, while a luxurious and comfortable vehicle, can be prone to certain issues as it ages. Engine problems such as balance shaft wear and intake manifold issues, along with transmission conductor plate failures, can be costly to repair. Electrical issues with the EIS and SAM modules are also common. Airmatic suspension issues (if equipped) can add to the maintenance burden. While some repairs are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive, making it crucial to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic specializing in Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Addressing these potential problems proactively can help maintain the E280's reliability and driving enjoyment.
