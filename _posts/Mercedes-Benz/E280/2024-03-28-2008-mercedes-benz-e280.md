The E280 is known for its refined driving experience, comfortable interior, and advanced technology. However, like many vehicles, it has experienced some issues that owners have reported.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6**

* **Cylinder Head Corrosion:** Premature corrosion of the cylinder heads can cause coolant leaks, overheating, and engine damage.
* **Intake Manifold Gaskets:** Leaking intake manifold gaskets can lead to rough idling, reduced power, and increased emissions.
* **Timing Chain Failure:** In some cases, the timing chain can stretch or break, causing catastrophic engine failure.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** Vibration or shuddering during acceleration can indicate a faulty torque converter.
* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Malfunctioning shift solenoids can cause delayed or harsh shifting, slipping gears, and transmission overheating.
* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Worn or damaged seals or gaskets can lead to transmission fluid leaks, which can affect performance and cause damage to the transmission.
