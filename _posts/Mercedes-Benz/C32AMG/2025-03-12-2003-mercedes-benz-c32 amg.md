The 2003 Mercedes-Benz C32 AMG is a high-performance variant of the W203 C-Class, known for its potent supercharged engine and sporty handling. The C32 AMG was only available with a 3.2L supercharged V6 engine that produced 349 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the C32 AMG for its exhilarating acceleration and relatively understated styling, making it a "sleeper" car. Common complaints revolve around maintenance costs, particularly concerning the supercharger and associated components, as well as some electrical gremlins typical of Mercedes-Benz vehicles of that era.

**Engine**

**3.2L Supercharged V6**
*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump circulates coolant through the supercharger's intercooler, helping to keep intake air temperatures down. When the pump fails, the engine can experience reduced power, especially during hot weather or extended periods of high-performance driving. Some owners report the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed intercooler pump. Upgraded aftermarket pumps are also available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger clutch is responsible for engaging and disengaging the supercharger. If it fails, the supercharger may not engage properly, leading to a significant loss of power. Whining or grinding noises from the supercharger area may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the supercharger clutch. This often requires specialized tools and knowledge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor relays data about the crankshaft position to the ECU to properly control engine timing. Symptoms are sudden engine shutoff while driving, engine not starting, and hesitation upon acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**
*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 722.6 transmission, while generally robust, can experience valve body problems. Symptoms include hard shifting, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, and getting stuck in limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the valve body. Some owners opt for upgraded valve bodies for improved performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure will cause shuddering, and harsh or delayed shifting between gears. The vehicle may have trouble maintaining speed on the highway and make loud noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the torque converter
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $750 - $1800+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks/Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some C32 AMGs might have been equipped with air suspension. Leaks in the air struts or failure of the air compressor can lead to the vehicle sagging, a bumpy ride, and the suspension warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air struts or the failing air compressor. Conversion to traditional coilover suspension is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per strut; $400 - $800 for the compressor; $1000 - $3000+ for coilover conversion.

*   **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front control arm bushings connect the control arm to the vehicle's frame. When these bushings wear out, they can cause clunking noises from the front suspension. They may also cause vibrations and instability at higher speeds.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the control arm bushings. Some owners opt to replace the entire control arm assembly for ease of installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD screens in the instrument cluster can suffer from pixel loss, making it difficult to read important information.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM controls various electrical functions, including lights, wipers, and power windows. A faulty SAM can cause a range of seemingly unrelated electrical problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reprogramming of the SAM unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common issue in Mercedes vehicles from this era where the windows are slow to move up and down or fail entirely. The issue is often caused by worn or broken plastic parts within the regulator assembly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The W203 C-Class is prone to rust, particularly around the wheel arches, door seams, and underbody.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, welding in new metal, and repainting. Prevention involves regular washing and waxing, as well as applying rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on severity

*   **Headlight Lens Clouding/Yellowing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic headlight lenses can become cloudy or yellowed over time due to UV exposure. This reduces headlight output.
    *   Solution: Headlight restoration kits can be used to polish the lenses. Replacement of the entire headlight assembly is another option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $30 - $100 for restoration kit; $300 - $800+ for new headlights.
