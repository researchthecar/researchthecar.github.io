The 2004 Mercedes-Benz C32 AMG is a performance-oriented compact sedan that was part of the W203 C-Class generation. It was offered with only one engine option: a supercharged 3.2-liter V6 producing 349 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. The C32 AMG was praised for its impressive power and acceleration for its size, sporty handling, and understated styling. However, some common criticisms include the firm ride quality, occasional maintenance costs associated with a performance vehicle, and some electronic gremlins. It was only offered with one transmission option, the 5-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**3.2L Supercharged V6 (M112 E32 ML)**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, especially in warmer weather. The intercooler pump is responsible for cooling the air entering the engine after it's been compressed by the supercharger. Failure can lead to heat soak and a significant drop in power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intercooler pump with an OEM or aftermarket equivalent. Upgraded pumps are often recommended for improved reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the pump and labor.

*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling or grinding noise from the supercharger area, intermittent loss of supercharger boost, and potentially a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the supercharger clutch. This may involve replacing the entire supercharger depending on the extent of the damage and availability of individual parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ depending on whether the clutch or the entire supercharger is replaced.

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, erratic idling, and possible Check Engine Light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

*   **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, and possible Check Engine Light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacing the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission slipping, getting stuck in a gear, and/or going into "limp mode." The conductor plate houses the electronic components that control the transmission's shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the conductor plate and potentially the valve body. Fluid and filter change is recommended as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping, and general poor transmission performance.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

*   **Transmission Fluid Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reddish-brown fluid under the car, especially near the transmission area. Can also lead to slipping and poor shifting if fluid levels get too low.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission pan gasket, the electrical connector adapter (pilot bushing) on the transmission, or other leaking seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.

**Suspension**

*   **AirMatic Suspension Issues (If equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension (especially after being parked), rough ride, and failure to maintain proper ride height. The air suspension system can develop leaks in the air struts or the air compressor can fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing leaking air struts and/or the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per strut, $500 - $1000+ for the compressor.

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per control arm depending on whether you replace the bushings or the entire arm.

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels missing or fading in the instrument cluster display, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on whether the cluster is repaired or replaced.

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window not operating properly (slow, noisy, or not moving at all).
    *   Solution: Replacing the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per window.

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A variety of electrical problems, including lighting malfunctions, sensor failures, and other electronic glitches.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific issue and potentially reprogramming or replacing the SAM unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the issue and whether the SAM needs to be replaced.

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof gets stuck, makes loud noises, or fails to open or close completely.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, replacing the sunroof motor, or repairing the sunroof mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the complexity of the repair.

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on body panels, especially around wheel wells, door seams, and underbody.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing affected panels, rust treatment, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the extent of the rust.

**Interior**

**Recalls:**
None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Mercedes-Benz C32 AMG, while a potent and enjoyable vehicle, does have its share of common issues. The engine and transmission components, particularly the intercooler pump, supercharger clutch, conductor plate, and valve body, are known to experience problems that can lead to costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster pixel failure and SAM module issues, also crop up. While the severity and cost of these issues can vary, potential buyers should be aware of these potential pitfalls and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs.
