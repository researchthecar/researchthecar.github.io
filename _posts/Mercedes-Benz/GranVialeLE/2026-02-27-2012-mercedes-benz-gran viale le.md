### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE, particularly with its diesel engine options, presents a generally reliable platform for commercial use. Common issues tend to be related to the diesel particulate filter (DPF) and associated emissions systems, especially under urban driving conditions. Turbocharger and transmission-related problems, particularly with the automatic gearboxes, can arise with higher mileage. Electrical gremlins like battery drain are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and complexity. Regular maintenance, adherence to service intervals, and proactive checks of common wear items are crucial for maintaining the longevity and operational efficiency of the Gran Viale LE.
