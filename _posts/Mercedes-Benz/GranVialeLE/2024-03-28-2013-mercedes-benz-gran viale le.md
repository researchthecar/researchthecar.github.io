**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

* **Oil leaks:** Oil leaks can occur from the valve covers, oil pan, or rear main seal. Symptoms include low oil levels, oil spots under the vehicle, and a burning oil smell. The leak can be repaired by replacing the leaking part or applying a sealant. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $1,500+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to excessive noise, loss of power, and potentially a catastrophic engine failure. The tensioner must be replaced to resolve the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $3,000+
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can cause vacuum leaks, resulting in rough idling, poor fuel economy, and reduced performance. The gasket needs to be replaced. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shifting problems:** The transmission may experience difficulties shifting gears, slipping gears, or refusing to shift at all. These issues can be caused by worn clutches, faulty sensors, or a defective transmission control module. The transmission may need to be overhauled or replaced. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $2,000 - $5,000+
* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter may shudder when the vehicle is accelerating or shifting gears. This can be caused by a worn torque converter or a faulty lock-up solenoid. The torque converter or solenoid may need to be replaced. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $2,500+
