### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its powertrain. The 2.2L CDI diesel engine, while generally robust, can experience issues with glow plugs and the EGR system, which are common to many diesel engines. The 6-speed automatic transmission is also a strong performer, though torque converter and TCM issues can arise, often related to high mileage or heavy use. Suspension components like bushings and ball joints may require attention due to wear. Electrical systems can be prone to alternator failure and sensor malfunctions. Exterior and interior components are typically durable. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning lights are crucial for maximizing the longevity and reliability of this commercial-oriented vehicle.
