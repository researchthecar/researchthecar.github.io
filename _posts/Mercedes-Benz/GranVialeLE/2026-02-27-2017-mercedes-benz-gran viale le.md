### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE is generally considered a reliable vehicle, particularly in its core mechanical components. The diesel engines, while robust, can be susceptible to issues with emissions control systems like the DPF and EGR, especially if driven primarily on short trips. Electrical gremlins, often related to control modules or infotainment, are the most frequently cited non-wear-and-tear issues. The transmission and suspension systems are typically very durable. Proactive maintenance, including regular DPF regeneration cycles for diesel models and software checks for electrical systems, can significantly mitigate potential problems and ensure a positive ownership experience.
