The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE is a recreational vehicle (RV) built on a Mercedes-Benz chassis, typically the Sprinter. While specific engine details for the "LE" trim are scarce and often dependent on the upfitter, they generally used the 3.0L V6 diesel engine. This engine produces around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. This RV's strengths lie in its maneuverability compared to larger RVs, fuel efficiency for its class, and the generally comfortable Mercedes-Benz cabin. Common complaints revolve around the specific build quality issues of the RV conversion, rather than the underlying Mercedes-Benz mechanicals, and the limitations in space inherent to a smaller RV.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE, while offering a comfortable and relatively efficient RV experience, can suffer from issues common to the Sprinter chassis it is built upon, primarily concerning its diesel engine and transmission. Diesel particulate filter issues, EGR valve failures, and valve body problems in the transmission are the most concerning, with repair costs potentially exceeding $2,000 for some fixes. Sensor failures and general electrical gremlins are also possibilities. The air suspension, if equipped, can also present problems. Overall, potential buyers should budget for higher maintenance costs compared to other RV platforms and carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history.
