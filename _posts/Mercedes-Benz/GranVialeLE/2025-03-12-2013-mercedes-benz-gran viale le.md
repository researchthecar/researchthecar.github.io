The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE is a coach-built RV based on a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter chassis. It's known for its luxurious features and compact size compared to larger RVs. While specific engine and transmission options for this conversion are determined by the coach builder, common configurations use the Mercedes-Benz 3.0L V6 diesel engine paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. This engine produces around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Gran Viale LE for its fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and high-end appointments. Common dislikes include the higher price point and potential maintenance costs associated with the Mercedes-Benz chassis.
