The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE is a Class B RV built on a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter chassis. As a camper van, it prioritizes a luxurious and compact travel experience. The standard engine is a 3.0-liter turbodiesel V6 producing 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its fuel efficiency (for a Class B RV), comfortable ride, and the Mercedes-Benz reputation for quality. Some common dislikes include the higher price point compared to other RVs and the smaller living space. Below is a breakdown of the commonly reported issues.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbodiesel V6**

*   **Oil Cooler Seal Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are observed around the oil cooler housing, often dripping onto other engine components. Can cause a burning smell and eventual oil starvation if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler seal with an updated version. Cleaning the affected area to remove oil residue is also necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common problems revolve around the DEF injector, DEF tank heater, or the NOx sensors. These can trigger the check engine light and/or place the vehicle in limp mode (reduced engine power). Fault codes related to DEF quantity, DEF quality, or NOx sensor readings are common.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty component (DEF injector, DEF heater, NOx sensor). Sometimes, a software update can resolve NOx sensor issues. Cleaning or replacing the DEF tank may be necessary in severe cases of crystallization.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the faulty part. NOx sensors can be particularly expensive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when shifting between gears, particularly 2nd to 3rd. Shifting can also feel harsh or jerky.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush using the correct Mercedes-Benz approved fluid. If the problem persists, valve body replacement might be required. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 for a fluid flush, $1,500 - $3,000+ for valve body, $4,000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear air suspension system may experience leaks, causing the vehicle to sag on one or both sides. The air compressor may run excessively or fail entirely. Error messages related to air suspension height or pressure may appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Inspect the air springs, air lines, and air compressor for leaks. Replace any damaged components. The air compressor may also need replacement if it's overworked or faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the parts needing replacement. Air compressor replacement can be costly.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Chassis Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The main chassis battery frequently drains, especially when the vehicle is parked for extended periods. This can make it difficult or impossible to start the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draws in the electrical system. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories (like alarms or entertainment systems) that weren't properly installed, faulty control modules, or a failing alternator. Replacing a weak or old battery is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain. Tracing parasitic draws can be time-consuming and therefore expensive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Multimedia System (MBUX) Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unexpected reboots of the MBUX infotainment system. Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation problems, and unresponsive touchscreens are also common complaints.
    *   Solution: First, attempt a system reset or software update (if available). If the problems persist, the multimedia control unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software related issues, $800 - $2,000+ for control unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door. The door may get stuck, make unusual noises, or not latch properly. The power sliding door mechanism (if equipped) may fail.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sliding door tracks, rollers, and latch mechanism for damage or debris. Lubricate the tracks and rollers. If the power sliding door mechanism is faulty, it may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair and whether parts need to be replaced. Power sliding door repairs can be more expensive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **RV Components Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the RV-specific components such as the refrigerator, water pump, furnace, or air conditioner. These may fail to operate correctly, produce unusual noises, or leak.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific problem with the affected component. Repairs may involve replacing faulty parts, cleaning clogged lines, or adjusting settings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the component and the nature of the problem. RV appliance repairs can vary widely in cost.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE can be a comfortable and reliable RV, but potential owners should be aware of the reported issues. The most concerning problems relate to the engine's oil cooler seal, DEF system, the transmission's shifting performance, and the rear air suspension. Electrical issues and RV component malfunctions can also be problematic. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. Careful inspection and maintenance are crucial to prevent or address these issues early on.
