The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE is a lesser-known model and information on specific issues and complaints can be difficult to obtain. These vehicles are typically custom-built on Mercedes-Benz chassis and engine configurations can vary depending on the specific build and year of the chassis used. Due to the limited production numbers and custom nature of these vehicles, data on common issues is not as readily available as it is for mass-produced models. However, based on potential chassis configurations and common Mercedes-Benz issues of the era, we can outline potential problem areas.

**Engine**

Due to the custom nature of the Gran Viale LE, the engine options can vary considerably based on the build of the chassis. Without knowing the specific engine in a particular Gran Viale LE, it is impossible to be more specific. Here are two possible engine options and common issues of those engines.

**3.0L Turbocharged Diesel V6 (OM642)**
*Stats: Horsepower ~190hp, Torque ~325 lb-ft*
This engine would've been available in a Sprinter chassis that the Gran Viale LE would be built on. Owners likely appreciate the fuel economy of the diesel and its torque output for hauling. Owners dislike its complexity compared to gasoline engines.

*   **Oil Cooler Seal Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue on the OM642 engine, especially from the oil cooler seals located in the "V" of the engine. Symptoms include oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the oil cooler seals is the common solution. This requires significant disassembly of the intake system. Updated Viton seals are recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Swirl Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The swirl motor controls flaps in the intake manifold that optimize airflow. Failure leads to a check engine light, potential loss of power, and can ultimately lead to carbon buildup.
    *   Solution: Replacing the swirl motor is a temporary fix. Many owners opt for deleting the swirl flaps and reprogramming the ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Gasoline V6 (M272)**
*Stats: Horsepower ~268hp, Torque ~258 lb-ft*
This engine would've been available in a Sprinter chassis that the Gran Viale LE would be built on. Owners likely appreciate the power output of the engine. Owners dislike the fuel economy compared to the diesel version.

*   **Balance Shaft Sprocket Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A known issue for early M272 engines. Premature wear of the balance shaft sprocket can cause timing issues, rough running, and eventually engine failure. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idle, and potential engine noise.
    *   Solution: Replacing the balance shaft is a major repair requiring significant engine disassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft adjuster solenoids control the variable valve timing. Failure can cause rough running, check engine lights, and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Mercedes-Benz 5-Speed Automatic (NAG1 / 722.6)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate inside the transmission houses the speed sensors and valve body controls. Failure can cause erratic shifting, limp mode, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the conductor plate and potentially the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can cause vibrations, shuddering during shifts, and slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter, along with a transmission flush and filter change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some Gran Viale LE models may be equipped with air suspension. Compressor failure can cause the vehicle to sag, especially overnight, and can lead to a rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Spring Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air springs can develop leaks due to age and wear. This will cause the vehicle to sag, especially overnight.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air spring(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ per spring
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Glow Plug Module Failure (Diesel Only)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: On diesel models, the glow plug module can fail, leading to hard starting, especially in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Replacing the glow plug module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM controls various electrical functions. Failures can cause issues with lighting, wipers, and other accessories.
    *   Solution: Replacing or reprogramming the SAM unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sliding doors on vans can be prone to issues with the motor, cables, and sensors, leading to difficulty opening or closing.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the specific component causing the issue (motor, cable, sensor).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Actuator Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: HVAC actuators control the flow of air. Failures can cause inconsistent temperatures, and clicking noises behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty HVAC actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per actuator
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Older navigation and infotainment systems can experience software glitches, screen failures, and connectivity issues.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE, due to its custom nature and potential use of different chassis and engine configurations, presents a challenge in identifying specific widespread issues. Potential problems stem from the underlying Mercedes-Benz chassis components, including oil leaks on diesel engines, balance shaft wear on gasoline engines, transmission conductor plate failures, and air suspension issues if equipped. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor electrical fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission repairs. Due to the limited production, it is crucial to thoroughly inspect any potential purchase and obtain detailed service records to understand the vehicle's maintenance history and potential problem areas.
