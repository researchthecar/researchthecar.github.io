### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE demonstrates good overall reliability, with most systems performing as expected. The primary areas that may require attention are related to the diesel engines, particularly the 2.2L CDI and its potential for glow plug or turbocharger issues, and the 3.0L V6 CDI's DPF system. Automatic transmission issues, while not rampant, can involve fluid leaks or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or infotainment system, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally robust. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are key to ensuring long-term dependability.
