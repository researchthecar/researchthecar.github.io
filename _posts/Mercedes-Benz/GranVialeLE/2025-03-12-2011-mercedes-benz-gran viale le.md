The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE, also known as the Sprinter in some markets, is a versatile van popular for commercial and recreational purposes. It's a rebranded version of the Freightliner Sprinter and Dodge Sprinter that were sold in the U.S. and features a distinctive tall roof design and offers a spacious interior. Available engines included the 3.0L V6 diesel engine producing around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.5L V6 gasoline engine producing around 258 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the van's cargo capacity and fuel efficiency (particularly with the diesel engine), but some report issues with reliability and maintenance costs.

**Summary:**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE can be a reliable vehicle, but it's susceptible to certain common issues. The diesel engine, while fuel-efficient, can suffer from DPF and EGR valve problems, while the gasoline engine might experience camshaft adjuster or intake manifold issues. Transmission problems related to the valve body are not uncommon. Suspension components like leaf springs and sway bar links can also fail. Electrical issues, ranging from glow plug failure to wiring harness problems, can also surface. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs, with costs potentially exceeding $3,000 for major components like the DPF or transmission repairs. Thorough inspection and preventative maintenance are crucial for minimizing potential problems.
