The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale LE is a motorhome based on the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter chassis, offering a blend of luxury and practicality. While specific horsepower and torque figures can vary slightly depending on the exact engine configuration and model year, common engine options included a 3.0-liter V6 diesel engine, producing around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the vehicle's fuel efficiency (for its class), maneuverability, and comfortable interior. However, some common complaints include the relatively small living space and occasional maintenance issues related to the Sprinter chassis components.
