*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, getting stuck in a single gear, inability to shift, and potential limp-home mode activation. This issue is commonly caused by failure of the transmission conductor plate, which houses the speed sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission conductor plate and fluid/filter change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. The valve body contains numerous solenoids and valves that control the flow of transmission fluid, and these components can wear out or become clogged over time.
