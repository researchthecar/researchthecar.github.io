    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a well-documented issue affecting certain M272 engines produced within a specific date range. Premature wear of the balance shaft sprocket can lead to significant engine problems. Symptoms may include a check engine light, rough running, and eventual engine failure if not addressed. The issue is not always noticeable until it becomes severe.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the balance shaft. This is a labor-intensive repair.

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz C350 presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While the engine offers good performance, problems like balance shaft wear and camshaft adjuster failures can lead to expensive repairs. Transmission issues, particularly with the valve body, are also relatively common. Electrical problems, especially with the EIS and SAM units, can be frustrating. Suspension and interior issues, while less severe, can still contribute to overall ownership costs.
