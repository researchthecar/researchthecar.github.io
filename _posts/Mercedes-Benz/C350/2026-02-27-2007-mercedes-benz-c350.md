### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz C350 (W204) offers a compelling package of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 3.5L V6 engine is prone to issues with the intake manifold runner flaps and balance shaft wear, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can also develop problems with its valve body and torque converter. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items. Electrical issues, particularly with the SAM module, can lead to a variety of unpredictable problems. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, interior electronics like seat controls and sunroof drains can require attention. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these known weak points are crucial for maintaining the C350's reliability and value.
