The 2024 Mercedes-Benz SL43 AMG is a performance-oriented roadster featuring a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 375 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque, supplemented by a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. It exclusively uses a 9-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options for the 2024 SL include a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8, offered in SL55 and SL63 trims.
