The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Metris (known as the MP60 Express in some markets) is a versatile van often used for commercial purposes or as a family vehicle. Engine options typically included a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine, producing around 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine was generally paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Metris for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency compared to larger vans, and cargo capacity. Common complaints revolve around a somewhat basic interior, limited advanced safety features compared to newer vehicles, and some reliability concerns.
