The 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLS450 is a luxury SUV known for its spaciousness, opulent interior, and smooth ride. The GLS450 comes standard with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine that produces 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 in the GLS580 and a high-performance AMG variant. All engines are paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GLS for its comfort, technology, and overall refinement, however, some common complaints include complicated infotainment systems, some reliability concerns, and high repair costs.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6**
* **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine hesitation upon acceleration or, in rare cases, complete stalling, especially at lower speeds. This can manifest as a momentary lag or a more pronounced cut in power.
    * Solution: In some instances, a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) has resolved the issue. In other cases, replacement of faulty fuel injectors or sensors have been needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the specific cause and parts needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks (specifically around the oil filter housing or valve cover)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the engine block, oil puddles under the vehicle, or a burning oil smell can indicate a leak around the oil filter housing or valve cover.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected gaskets, seals, or the entire oil filter housing assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic**
* **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can feel like a jolt or hesitation during acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission control unit (TCU) software update can resolve the issue. More severe cases might require valve body replacement or, in rare instances, a full transmission replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine revs high but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly, or there's a noticeable lag in power delivery.
    * Solution: Requires thorough diagnosis, which may involve checking the transmission fluid level and condition, as well as inspecting the valve body, solenoids, and clutches. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8,000+ (depending on severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Issues (specifically related to Airmatic system)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may sag on one side, fail to maintain proper ride height, or display a warning light on the dashboard. Hissing sounds from the air struts or compressor are also common symptoms.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the air suspension system, which may involve replacing leaking air struts, the air compressor, or the valve block.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **MBUX Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or random reboots of the MBUX infotainment system. Connectivity issues with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto are also common.
