The 3.0L turbocharged inline-6 engine and the 9G-TRONIC transmission are robust and have not shown widespread issues. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the advanced technology and comfort features. The Airmatic air suspension can occasionally develop leaks, and the sophisticated MBUX infotainment system may experience software glitches. Additionally, some owners have reported premature failure of the 12V auxiliary battery. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not indicative of systemic powertrain failures. Overall, the GLS450 offers a reliable luxury experience, with most potential problems stemming from complex electronic and pneumatic systems rather than fundamental mechanical weaknesses.
