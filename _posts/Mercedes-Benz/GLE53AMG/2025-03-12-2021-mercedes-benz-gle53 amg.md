The 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLE53 AMG is a performance SUV known for its blend of luxury and sporty driving dynamics. The GLE lineup offered other engine choices including the GLE 350 with a 2.0L turbo inline-4, the GLE 450 with a 3.0L turbo inline-6, and the GLE 580 with a 4.0L biturbo V8. The GLE53 AMG is equipped with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine paired with an electric auxiliary compressor and a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, producing 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. People generally like the vehicle's powerful engine, comfortable interior, and advanced technology features. Some criticisms include the sometimes-harsh ride, complex infotainment system, and high price point. All GLE models use a 9-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 (M256)**

*   **Faulty 48V Mild Hybrid System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Check Engine" light, electrical system malfunction, reduced power, vehicle stalling. This is often due to a faulty Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) or related components of the 48V system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the 48V system is required. Replacement of the ISG or other failed components (e.g., voltage converter) is typical. A software update may sometimes resolve the issue, but hardware replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine, reduced power, "Check Engine" light, and potential oil leaks. The turbocharger may fail due to excessive wear or oil starvation.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement is required. It is also advisable to inspect the oil lines and ensure proper lubrication to the new turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (9G-TRONIC - 725.0)**

*   **Rough or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable jolts or hesitation during gear changes, especially at lower speeds. May be more pronounced when cold.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, the valve body may need to be inspected and potentially replaced. In more severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs rise without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. Could also be accompanied by delayed engagement of gears.
    * Solution: If a fluid flush doesn't resolve the problem, a more in-depth inspection is needed. Valve body issues and worn clutch packs are possible causes. Repair or replacement of these components is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $6,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (AIRMATIC)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, "Ride Height Malfunction" warning light, rough ride, or inability to adjust ride height. This is typically caused by leaks in the air struts, a faulty air compressor, or issues with the valve block.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the leak or failure. Replacement of the affected air strut(s), air compressor, or valve block is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ per strut, $800 - $2,000+ for compressor/valve block.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing (MBUX)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash and reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Start with a system reset. If the problem persists, a software update may be required. In some cases, the MBUX unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) - $2,000+ (unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alarms, error messages, or complete failure of the affected system. This can be caused by faulty sensors, wiring issues, or software glitches.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is malfunctioning. Replacement of the sensor or repair of the wiring is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof may get stuck, not open or close correctly, or make excessive noise during operation.
    * Solution: Check the sunroof tracks for debris and lubricate them. If the problem persists, the sunroof motor or other mechanical components may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,000+ depending on the component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seat adjustments not working correctly, seat heaters failing.
    * Solution: Check seat adjustment and heating elements. Replacement of the faulty motors or heating elements will be needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1,000+ depending on the component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLE53 AMG can experience a range of issues, from relatively minor software glitches to more significant problems with the engine, transmission, and suspension. The 48V mild-hybrid system, turbocharger, and air suspension appear to be particularly susceptible to problems, which can result in high repair costs. While the GLE53 AMG offers impressive performance and luxury, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing.
