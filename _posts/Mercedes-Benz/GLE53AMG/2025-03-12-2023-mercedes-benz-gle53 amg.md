The 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLE53 AMG is a performance-oriented SUV that blends luxury with AMG's signature sporty character. It boasts a handcrafted AMG 3.0L inline-6 turbo engine with mild hybrid drive, generating 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. Other GLE models include a range of engine options, including a 2.0L inline-4 turbo engine, a 3.0L inline-6 turbo engine, and a 4.0L V8 Biturbo engine. The AMG GLE53 comes standard with an AMG Speedshift TCT 9-speed transmission. Owners often praise its powerful engine, comfortable interior, and advanced technology. However, some criticisms include the high price tag, the sometimes-stiff ride quality (even with the adaptive suspension), and complex infotainment system.
