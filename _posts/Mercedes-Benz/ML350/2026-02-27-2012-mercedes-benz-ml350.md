### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz ML350 (W166) presents a generally reliable profile for a luxury SUV, particularly with its standard coil spring suspension. The gasoline V6 engine can experience timing chain and oil leak issues, while the diesel variant may encounter DPF and AdBlue system problems. Transmission issues, though not rampant, can include leaks and torque converter faults. Optional air suspension systems are more prone to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment and keyless entry systems, are also noted. Despite these potential issues, many ML350s perform well with proper maintenance, but repairs, especially for specialized systems like air suspension or diesel emissions, can be costly.
