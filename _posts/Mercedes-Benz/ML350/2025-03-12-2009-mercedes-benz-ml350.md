**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz ML350 can be a comfortable and luxurious SUV, but it is important to be aware of the potential issues. The most significant and costly problems often relate to the engine (balance shaft), transmission (valve body), and air suspension (if equipped). Electrical issues (EIS, SAM) are also relatively common. Due to the age of the vehicle, maintenance is crucial, and preventative repairs can save money in the long run. Repair costs can be high due to the cost of Mercedes-Benz parts and specialized labor requirements. Prospective buyers should have a thorough pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic experienced with Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
