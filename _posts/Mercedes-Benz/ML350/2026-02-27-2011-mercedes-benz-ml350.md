### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz ML350 (W164) is a capable luxury SUV with a generally good reliability record for its segment, though it is not without potential issues. The 3.5L V6 engine can be prone to intake manifold runner flap failures and balance shaft gear wear, which can be costly to repair. The 7-speed automatic transmission, while generally smooth, may experience torque converter shudder or valve body issues. Optional air suspension systems are a common source of problems, with leaks and compressor failures being prevalent. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM unit, can also arise. Interior components like headliners can sag over time. Despite these potential concerns, many owners find the ML350 to be a comfortable and dependable vehicle when properly maintained. Addressing potential issues proactively can help mitigate larger repair bills.
