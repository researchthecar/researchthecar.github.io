### Summary Verdict

The automatic transmission can suffer from TCM failures or torque converter problems. Suspension components, especially if equipped with air suspension, can develop leaks. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and instrument clusters are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern on older models. While many owners enjoy these vehicles, potential buyers should be prepared for the possibility of repairs, particularly concerning the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
