### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mercedes-Benz ML350 (W166) demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its powertrain. The 3.5L V6 engine and 7-speed automatic transmission are generally robust, though potential issues like oil cooler leaks and timing chain wear on the engine, and TCM or mechatronics unit problems on the transmission, have been noted. The optional air suspension is a common source of repair, with leaks and compressor failures being the primary concerns. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment and keyless entry systems, can also arise. Despite these points, the ML350 remains a solid choice for a luxury SUV, with most reported issues being repairable and not indicative of systemic failure across the model range.
