### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz ML350 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components are generally robust, specific issues like intake manifold leaks on the V6 and camshaft sensor problems on the V8 are relatively common. Transmission issues, particularly with the conductor plate and TCM, can be costly. Suspension components, especially if equipped with air suspension, can also require significant investment. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and MAF sensors, are not uncommon. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs in these areas, especially as the vehicle ages. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for mitigating larger problems and maintaining the vehicle's overall reliability.
