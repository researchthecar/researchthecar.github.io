The 2006 Mercedes-Benz ML350 is a mid-size luxury SUV that offers a comfortable ride and a stylish interior. The ML350 comes standard with a 3.5L V6 engine producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 5.0L V8 and a 5.4L AMG V8. All engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its solid build quality and comfortable interior. Common complaints include electrical issues, relatively high maintenance costs, and some problems with the air suspension (if equipped).

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **Balance Shaft Sprocket Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The balance shaft sprocket, particularly in early production M272 engines (which includes the 2006 ML350), can wear prematurely. This leads to a check engine light, rough running, and eventually engine damage if not addressed. The issue is caused by soft metal used in the sprocket.
    * Solution: Replacing the balance shaft with an updated version made of hardened steel.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Cam Magnet) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Faulty camshaft adjuster solenoids can cause rough idling, reduced engine performance, and illumination of the check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover, Oil Filter Housing)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, especially from the valve cover gaskets and the oil filter housing. This results in visible oil leaks, a burning smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets and/or the oil filter housing gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve Cover Gaskets: $300 - $700+, Oil Filter Housing Gasket: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**5.4L AMG V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (722.9)**

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 722.9 transmission is known for valve body issues. Symptoms include hard shifting, erratic shifting, slipping between gears, and getting stuck in gear.
    * Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. Sometimes a software update can alleviate minor issues, but physical valve body replacement is often necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at certain speeds, especially during acceleration. Can also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The airmatic suspension system can develop leaks in the air struts or compressor failure. This results in the vehicle sitting low on one or more corners, a "Suspension Fault" warning light, and a noisy or non-functional air compressor.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts, air compressor, or air lines.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Air Strut Replacement (each): $800 - $1,500+, Air Compressor Replacement: $700 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clicking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Can also cause uneven tire wear and loose steering.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per pair
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The EIS can fail, preventing the vehicle from starting. The key may not turn, or the car may start intermittently.
    * Solution: Replacing the EIS and potentially reprogramming keys.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The SAM controls various electrical functions. Failure can cause issues with lights, wipers, power windows, and other electrical components.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty SAM unit and programming it to the vehicle.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window not moving, clicking noises when trying to operate the window, window falling into the door.
    * Solution: Replacing the window regulator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sunroof Issues**

**Summary**

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz ML350 has some potential issues to be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the engine (balance shaft in early models) and transmission (valve body). The Airmatic suspension (if equipped) can also be a costly repair. Electrical problems with the EIS and SAM modules are also relatively common. While the ML350 offers luxury and comfort, potential buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair costs, particularly for the balance shaft and air suspension issues. Overall the severity of the issues varies, but the cost to repair can be considerable, especially if multiple components fail.
