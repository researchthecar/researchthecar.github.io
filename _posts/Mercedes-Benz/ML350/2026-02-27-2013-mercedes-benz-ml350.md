### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz ML350 (W166) demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its powertrain. The 3.5L V6 engine is generally robust, though potential owners should be aware of possible oil leaks from gaskets and seals, and less commonly, timing chain issues. The 7-speed automatic transmission is also well-regarded, with occasional reports of harsh shifting that may require fluid services or software updates. The optional air suspension is a notable area for potential expense, with leaks being the primary concern. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and keyless entry, can occur but are often resolvable with software updates. The exterior and interior components are typically durable. Regular maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly will contribute to a positive ownership experience.
