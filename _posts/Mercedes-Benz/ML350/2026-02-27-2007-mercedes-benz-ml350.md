### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz ML350 (W164) is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of specific common issues. The 3.5L V6 engine is prone to intake manifold runner flap failures and, more seriously, balance shaft gear wear, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can experience valve body or torque converter problems. Optional air suspension systems are also a known area for potential leaks and compressor failures. While electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM module, can occur, the exterior and interior generally hold up well. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating these potential reliability concerns.
