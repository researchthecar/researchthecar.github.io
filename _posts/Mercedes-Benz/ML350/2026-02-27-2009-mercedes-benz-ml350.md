### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz ML350 (W164) presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.5L V6 engine, while powerful, is susceptible to issues like intake manifold runner flap failure and balance shaft gear wear, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can also develop problems with its valve body or torque converter. Suspension components, particularly air springs if equipped, and control arm bushings, may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the SAM unit or instrument cluster, are also a concern. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of these common mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities and factor in potential repair costs.
