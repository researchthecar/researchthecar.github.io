**Engine**

**5.4L Supercharged V8**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump circulates coolant through the intercooler system to keep the intake air temperature down. If the pump fails, it can result in a loss of power, especially in hot weather. The engine might feel sluggish, and you may experience reduced acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets are common as the rubber gaskets age and harden. This can result in oil drips, a burning smell, and potentially low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, difficulty shifting, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, getting stuck in gear, or a complete loss of gear selection. This part contains the transmission's electronic control unit.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the conductor plate and potentially the valve body if it's been damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Airmatic suspension is prone to leaks and failures. Symptoms include the car sagging on one or more corners, a warning light on the dashboard, and a noisy air compressor. The compressor may run continuously trying to maintain pressure.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected air struts, air compressor, or valve block. Diagnose the system for leaks using soapy water or a smoke test.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per strut, $500 - $1000+ for the compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S55 AMG has a complex electrical system that can be prone to parasitic battery drains. This can result in a dead battery, especially if the car sits for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the battery drain, which could be a faulty module, relay, or wiring issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain and labor hours required for diagnosis)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with lights, wipers, power windows, or other electrical components. The SAM module controls various electrical functions, and failure can cause a wide range of problems.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty SAM module and reprogram it to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can occur on the body panels, especially in areas prone to moisture and road salt.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace affected panels and apply rust protection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Command System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The COMAND system, which controls the navigation, audio, and climate control, can experience glitches, screen failures, or complete shutdowns.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the COMAND unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
