The 2002 Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG is a high-performance luxury sedan that combined impressive power with a comfortable ride. The S55 AMG was equipped with a 5.4L Supercharged V8 producing 355 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the S-Class included a range of V6 and V8 engines, but the S55 AMG represented the top-tier performance model. A notable feature of the S55 AMG was its Active Body Control (ABC) suspension. Many owners appreciated the car's blend of luxury, performance, and advanced technology. However, the complex systems could also lead to reliability concerns and costly repairs as the car aged.

**Engine**

**5.4L Supercharged V8**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump circulates coolant through the intercooler to cool the intake air. A failing pump can lead to reduced performance, especially in hot weather, and can trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump. Upgraded aftermarket pumps are also available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor provides engine speed and position information to the ECU. Failure can cause stalling, rough running, or a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300

*   **Supercharger Clutch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger clutch can fail, preventing the supercharger from engaging. This results in a noticeable loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the supercharger clutch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the valve body can cause harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or a failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter problems can manifest as shuddering during acceleration, poor fuel economy, or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+

**Suspension**

*   **Active Body Control (ABC) System Leaks and Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC system uses hydraulic pressure to control the suspension. Leaks in the hydraulic lines, pump failures, or strut failures are common issues. These problems can lead to a loss of ride height, a harsh ride, or warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing leaking hydraulic lines, rebuilding or replacing the ABC pump, or replacing faulty ABC struts. Flushing the system with new fluid regularly can help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ per component

*   **ABC Accumulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Accumulators store hydraulic pressure for the ABC system. When they fail, the ride can become very harsh and the ABC system may become less effective.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty accumulators.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixelation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the instrument cluster LCD screen can fade or disappear, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. Some shops specialize in repairing the LCD screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM controls various electrical functions. Failures can cause problems with lighting, wipers, power windows, or other electrical components.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car may experience a rapid battery drain, especially if it sits for a few days. This can be due to a faulty component not shutting down properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic drain and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source)

**Summary**

The 2002 Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG offers a unique blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that can arise as the car ages. The ABC suspension, electrical systems, and supercharged engine components are areas of particular concern. Repairs can be costly, especially for the ABC system and transmission. A thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended before purchasing this vehicle. While the engine and transmission issues can be somewhat severe, the ABC system is by far the most notorious. Overall, owning a 2002 S55 AMG can be rewarding, but it's essential to be prepared for potential maintenance costs.
