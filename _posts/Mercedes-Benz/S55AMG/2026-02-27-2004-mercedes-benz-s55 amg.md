### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its complexity, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the supercharged V8 engine, can lead to significant repair costs. Common issues include ABC system failures (pump and struts), transmission control module problems, and various electrical gremlins related to the SAM units and instrument cluster. While the engine itself is robust, the supercharger belt and ignition system can require attention. Owners should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair bills, especially for the advanced suspension and powertrain components. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these issues.
