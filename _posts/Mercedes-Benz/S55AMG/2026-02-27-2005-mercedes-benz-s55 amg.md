### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its complexity, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the supercharged V8 engine, means potential owners should be prepared for higher maintenance and repair costs. Common issues revolve around hydraulic leaks in the ABC system, potential failures in the transmission's conductor plate, and various engine-related leaks. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the SAM unit, can also be a concern. While the exterior and some interior components are generally robust, the sophisticated systems require diligent maintenance and specialized knowledge for reliable operation. It's a car that rewards attentive ownership with exhilarating performance but demands a significant budget for upkeep.
