### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its complexity, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the supercharged V8 engine, means potential for significant repair costs. Common issues include ABC system leaks and pump failures, transmission conductor plate problems, and occasional electrical glitches like instrument cluster pixelation or SAM unit water ingress. While the engine itself is robust, the supercharger clutch can be a wear item. Owners should be prepared for higher maintenance and repair expenses compared to less performance-oriented vehicles. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these potential issues and preserving the car's performance and comfort.
