**Engine**

**5.4L Supercharged V8**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump circulates coolant through the supercharger's intercooler, cooling the intake air. A failing pump can cause reduced engine power, especially during hot weather or under heavy load. The car may go into limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor can fail, leading to difficulty starting the engine, stalling, or rough running.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets are common as the gaskets age and harden. Visible oil around the valve covers and a burning oil smell are typical symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate inside the transmission houses the solenoids and sensors. Failure can cause erratic shifting, getting stuck in gear, or complete loss of gear engagement.
    *   Solution: Replace the conductor plate and filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, resulting in shuddering during acceleration, poor fuel economy, and transmission slippage.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Airmatic air suspension system is prone to failures. This can manifest as the car sitting low on one or more corners, a "Visit Workshop" message on the dashboard, or a complete loss of air suspension. Components that commonly fail include the air struts, air compressor, and valve block.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air struts, air compressor, or valve block. Individual components can be replaced, but a full system overhaul may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per strut, $500 - $1500+ for the compressor, $300 - $800+ for the valve block
    *   Recalls: None Found
