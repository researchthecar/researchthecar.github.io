### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious sedan, but its complexity, particularly the Active Body Control suspension and advanced electronics, means potential for significant repair costs. While the engine and transmission are generally robust, specific components like solenoids and conductor plates can fail. Electrical issues, especially related to water intrusion in the SAM unit and instrument cluster problems, are common. The ABC suspension is a known area of concern for leaks and pump failures. Prospective buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair expenses, and a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
