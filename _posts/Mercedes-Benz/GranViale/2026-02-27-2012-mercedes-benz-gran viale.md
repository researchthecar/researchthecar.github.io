### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale, while generally well-regarded, exhibits some common issues typical for luxury vehicles of its age and complexity. Powertrain components, particularly the diesel engines' emissions systems (DPF, EGR) and turbochargers, can require attention. The 7G-TRONIC transmission, while advanced, may develop issues with fluid leaks or valve body problems. Suspension, especially air suspension systems, can be a source of costly repairs due to leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Despite these potential concerns, many owners find the vehicle to be reliable with proactive maintenance and timely repairs, especially for the petrol engines and standard suspension setups. Overall, it offers a blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability points.
