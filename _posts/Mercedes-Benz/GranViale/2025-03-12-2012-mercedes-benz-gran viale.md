The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, often used as a base for conversions like the Gran Viale, is a popular choice for camper vans due to its spacious interior and robust build. Engine options for this year include a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel engine producing around 161 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter V6 diesel engine generating approximately 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. A common dislike is the potential for expensive repairs and maintenance due to its European design. Owners appreciate the van's reliability, cargo space, and overall driving experience.
