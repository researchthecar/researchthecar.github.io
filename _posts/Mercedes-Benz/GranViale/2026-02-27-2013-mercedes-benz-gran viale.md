### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale, leveraging proven Mercedes-Benz technology, generally offers good reliability for its class. The diesel engines, particularly the 2.2L CDI, are robust but can experience issues like DPF problems or turbocharger wear over time, with associated repair costs. The 7G-TRONIC transmission is generally reliable, though fluid leaks and torque converter issues can arise. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and battery drain, are not uncommon and require professional diagnosis. While the exterior and interior are typically well-built, HVAC system issues can affect cabin comfort. Overall, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to potential problems, the Gran Viale can be a dependable vehicle.
