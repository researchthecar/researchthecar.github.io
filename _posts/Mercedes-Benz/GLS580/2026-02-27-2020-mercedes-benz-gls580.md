### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLS580 demonstrates a generally strong reliability profile, particularly concerning its powertrain (4.0L Twin-Turbo V8 and 9G-TRONIC transmission), which shows no widespread reported issues. However, potential owners should be aware of the AIRMATIC air suspension system, which can be prone to leaks or compressor failures, leading to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, especially within the MBUX infotainment system and occasional 12V battery drain issues, are also noted areas that may require attention. While not indicative of a fundamentally unreliable vehicle, these specific components represent the most common technical concerns beyond standard maintenance for this luxury SUV.
