**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz S 430, while luxurious, can present owners with a range of potential issues, many of which are related to the car's complex electronic and air suspension systems. Engine and transmission issues can also arise as the vehicle ages. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the problem. The Airmatic suspension and electrical systems are particularly known for their potential for costly repairs. Due to the age of the vehicle, rubber and plastic parts are prone to dry rot and failure, which can contribute to issues.
