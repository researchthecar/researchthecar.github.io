The 2006 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W221) is a luxury sedan known for its advanced technology, comfortable ride, and opulent interior. The S 417 isn't a specific trim, and it is possible that it is a typo and you mean the S 430 or S 500. However, the S 430 was not offered in 2006, making it likely that this refers to an S 500. The S 500 came standard with a 5.0L M113 V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2006 S-Class included a 3.5L V6 (S 350 - not available in all markets), a 4.3L V8 (S 430 - not available in all markets), a 5.5L V8 (S 550), a 6.0L V12 (S 600), and AMG variants with supercharged V8 engines. All engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). Owners often praise the S-Class for its smooth ride, luxurious features, and powerful engines. Common complaints include expensive maintenance, complex electronics that can be prone to failure, and high repair costs.

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz S-Class offers a luxurious driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Airmatic suspension failures and electrical problems are prevalent and can be expensive to repair. Transmission valve body issues are also common and can significantly impact the driving experience. Addressing these issues proactively can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and prevent costly repairs down the road. Due to the age of the vehicle and the amount of issues that are expected to come up due to the age of the vehicle, the annual cost of ownership is typically higher than most vehicles.
