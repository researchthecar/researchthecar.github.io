The 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQS 450 is an all-electric luxury sedan that offers a blend of performance, technology, and comfort. The EQS 450+ features a single electric motor powering the rear wheels, producing 355 horsepower and 419 lb-ft of torque. Other EQS models offer dual-motor all-wheel drive with increased power output. Owners often praise the EQS for its opulent interior, smooth ride, cutting-edge technology (such as the Hyperscreen), and impressive range. Some common criticisms include the complicated infotainment system and polarizing exterior styling.
**Electric Motor**

**Single Motor (EQS 450+)**

*   **Loss of Power / "Turtle Mode"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle suddenly enters a reduced power mode, sometimes referred to as "turtle mode," limiting speed and acceleration. This can be caused by a software glitch affecting battery management or motor control. Some owners have reported this occurring unexpectedly during normal driving conditions.
    *   Solution: A software update from Mercedes-Benz is typically required to address the underlying software issue. In some cases, a complete reset of the vehicle's systems may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 if under warranty, otherwise diagnostic fees may apply (potentially $200 - $400+) in addition to the cost of the software update (if applicable).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery, which powers auxiliary systems, drains rapidly, leading to starting issues or system malfunctions. This can be caused by parasitic drain from a faulty module or improperly shut down electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves identifying the source of the parasitic drain and replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$1,000+, depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hyperscreen Freezing/Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Hyperscreen, which integrates multiple displays into a single large unit, can freeze, lag, or exhibit other malfunctions. This can impact access to vehicle controls, navigation, and entertainment features.
    *   Solution: Often resolved by a software update or a system reset. In some cases, hardware replacement of the Hyperscreen unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 if under warranty, or $1,000 - $5,000+ if the hardware needs to be replaced outside of warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors or blind spot monitoring systems may provide false alerts, fail to detect obstacles, or become completely inoperative. This can be caused by sensor damage, misalignment, or software glitches.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking sensor alignment, cleaning sensors, or replacing faulty sensors. Software updates may also address related issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on location and complexity of replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Malfunctioning Massaging Seats**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The massaging seats may fail to operate, provide uneven massage intensity, or make unusual noises. This can be caused by issues with the seat's internal motors or pneumatic system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves inspecting the seat's internal components and replacing faulty motors, hoses, or control modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+, depending on the specific component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQS 450, while lauded for its luxury and technology, faces some reliability concerns. The most common issues appear to be software-related glitches that can affect the electric motor performance, Hyperscreen, and sensor systems. There have been reported issues with the 12V battery being drained. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potential safety concerns. The cost of repairs can vary significantly, with software updates potentially being free under warranty, while hardware replacements can be quite expensive.
