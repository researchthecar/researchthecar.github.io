**Summary:** The 2002 Mercedes-Benz CLK55 AMG, while a desirable vehicle, is prone to certain issues due to its age and performance-oriented nature. The most significant and costly problems tend to be related to the transmission (conductor plate/valve body) and electrical components (instrument cluster). Engine issues, such as oil leaks, are also relatively common. Suspension components are also a typical maintenance item at this age. While some issues can be addressed relatively inexpensively, others require more extensive repairs, potentially making ownership more expensive than some might anticipate.
