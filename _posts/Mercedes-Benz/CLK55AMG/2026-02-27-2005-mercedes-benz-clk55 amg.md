### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz CLK55 AMG offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but its age means potential buyers should anticipate some common reliability concerns. The robust 5.4L V8 engine is generally solid, though cooling system and oil leaks are not uncommon. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while durable, can suffer from TCM or conductor plate issues. Suspension components, particularly control arm bushings and the advanced ABC system (if equipped), are prone to wear and can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and headlight ballasts, can also surface. Interior electronics, like the instrument cluster display, may also require attention. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and prompt repairs, the CLK55 AMG remains a rewarding and capable performance coupe.
