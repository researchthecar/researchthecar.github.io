*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common around the valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: The idler pulley and belt tensioner can fail, leading to a squealing noise, belt slippage, and potential damage to other engine components.
    *   Solution: Replace the idler pulley and belt tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **MAF (Mass Air Flow) Sensor Failure**

    *   Solution: Replace the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, getting stuck in gear, or complete loss of gear engagement. This is a common issue on the 722.6 transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the conductor plate within the transmission. A transmission fluid and filter change is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping or Delayed Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips between gears, delayed engagement, or erratic shifting behavior.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service (fluid and filter change). If the problem persists, further diagnostics and possible valve body repair or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on the severity of the problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, particularly overnight, noisy air compressor, and "Suspension Fault" warnings on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace leaking air struts, air compressor, or air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per strut or compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially over bumps. Poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the car, key not recognized, or complete failure to start.
    *   Solution: Replace the EIS module and potentially reprogram the key.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixelation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the instrument cluster display fade or disappear, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can appear on the wheel arches, door edges, and underbody, especially in regions with harsh winters or coastal climates.

**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz CLK55 AMG, while a desirable performance car, does suffer from some common age-related issues. Engine oil leaks, transmission problems (specifically conductor plate failure), suspension issues (especially air suspension if equipped), and electrical problems (EIS failure and instrument cluster pixelation) are the most prevalent. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs compared to more modern vehicles.
