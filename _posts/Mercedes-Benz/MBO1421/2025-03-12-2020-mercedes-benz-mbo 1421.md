The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB 250 (MBO 1421) is a compact luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, available third-row seating (making it unique in its class), and comfortable ride. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Some owners praise its practicality and upscale feel, while others find the infotainment system complex and the base engine adequate but not particularly thrilling. Potential buyers should be aware of some reported issues.
