The 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG is a high-performance compact coupe/sedan known for its potent engine and sporty handling. The CLA is available with two engine options, a 2.0L Turbo Inline-4 which is available in the CLA250 and CLA35 and a hand built AMG 2.0L Turbo Inline-4 in the CLA45 variant. The AMG variant produces 375 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines come standard with an automatic transmission, with the AMG engine equipped with an AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 7-speed transmission. People often praise the CLA45 AMG for its exhilarating acceleration, sharp steering, and premium interior. However, some criticisms include its relatively stiff ride and limited rear passenger space.
