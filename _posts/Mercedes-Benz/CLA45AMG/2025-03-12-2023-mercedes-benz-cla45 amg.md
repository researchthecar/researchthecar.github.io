The 2023 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG is a high-performance compact sedan known for its aggressive styling, luxurious interior, and powerful engine. It boasts a handcrafted 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 382 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While lauded for its exhilarating performance and striking design, some owners have reported experiencing certain issues. Some like the styling and performance, but others dislike the price and ride quality.

**Engine**

**2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This may manifest as the low oil level warning light illuminating on the dashboard or noticing a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: The underlying cause can vary. Initially, dealers often perform an oil consumption test to determine the rate of consumption. Potential fixes range from replacing the PCV valve or valve stem seals to, in more severe cases, replacing the piston rings or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported turbocharger failure resulting in loss of power, unusual noises (whining or screeching), and/or the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis typically involves inspecting the turbocharger for damage or wear. If faulty, replacement of the turbocharger is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Harsh or Jerky Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds or during downshifts. This can also present as hesitation during acceleration.
    * Solution: This issue may be addressed with a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, replacement of the transmission valve body or even the entire transmission may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $8,000+ (transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the transmission slipping and/or delayed engagement from a stop.
    * Solution: This can be due to low transmission fluid, a faulty valve body or a failing transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear of suspension components, such as bushings, ball joints, and struts. This can manifest as clunking noises, excessive body roll, and/or uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the suspension components and replacement of worn parts is generally required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the specific parts needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning MBUX System**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the MBUX infotainment system, including freezing, lagging, random reboots, and/or failure of certain features (navigation, voice control, etc.).
    * Solution: Potential solutions include software updates, resetting the system, or, in more extreme cases, replacement of the MBUX control unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (MBUX unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with sensors related to advanced driver-assistance systems, such as blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control. This can result in warning lights, false alerts, or system malfunctions.
    * Solution: This often requires diagnosing the specific sensor that is failing and replacing it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rattling or squeaking noises emanating from various parts of the interior, such as the dashboard, door panels, or seats.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the noise and tightening or replacing any loose components is typically required. This can be a time-consuming process, as pinpointing the exact cause can be challenging.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2023 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG, while powerful and stylish, has reported issues ranging from minor interior rattles to more significant engine and transmission concerns.
