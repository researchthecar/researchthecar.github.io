The 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG is a performance-oriented compact sedan known for its aggressive styling and potent powertrain. The CLA line also features the CLA250, which offers a less powerful engine and a more comfort-focused driving experience. The CLA45 AMG, however, boasts a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 engine producing 355 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the CLA45 AMG's rapid acceleration, sharp handling, and distinctive design. Some common dislikes include a firm ride, limited rear seat space, and relatively high price point for the segment.
