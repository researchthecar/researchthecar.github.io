The 2022 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG is a performance-oriented compact sedan known for its potent engine and sporty handling. It comes standard with a handcrafted 2.0L turbo inline-4 engine producing 382 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DCT) and all-wheel drive. People like the car's aggressive styling, powerful engine, and technology, but some dislike the firm ride and higher price point compared to its rivals.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbo Inline-4 (M139)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms may include the low oil level warning light illuminating, noticeable oil smell, or the need to add oil more frequently than expected.
    *   Solution: The solution can range from simply monitoring oil levels and topping off as needed to more involved repairs like piston ring replacement in severe cases. A dealer performed oil consumption test is usually required to determine the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the cause. Monitoring and topping off oil has minimal cost. Piston ring replacement can range from $5,000 - $8,000+ depending on the dealer.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (DCT)**

*   **Harsh or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly at lower speeds or during downshifts. This can manifest as a noticeable "clunk" or hesitation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Some instances are improved with a software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) or a transmission fluid flush/service. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. Transmission fluid flush/service may cost around $500. Valve body replacement can range from $2,000 - $4,000. Transmission replacement can range from $8,000 - $12,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Stiff Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CLA45 AMG is known for its sporty but firm suspension. Some owners have complained that the ride quality is too harsh for daily driving, particularly on rough roads. This can lead to discomfort for both the driver and passengers.
    *   Solution: Unfortunately, the suspension is part of the package on the CLA45 AMG. There are no specific solutions to soften the ride without sacrificing the performance characteristics of the vehicle. Some owners may consider aftermarket adjustable dampers, but this can affect handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A, it is not a defect. Replacing shocks with aftermarket adjustable shocks will depend on the brand of shocks and can range from $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning MBUX System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment system, including freezing, lagging, unexpected reboots, and unresponsive touchscreens.
    *   Solution: A software update can often resolve these issues. If the problem persists, the MBUX unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically covered under warranty. Replacement of the MBUX unit can range from $1,500 - $3,000.

    *   Solution: Locating and addressing the source of the squeaks and rattles often involves tightening loose trim pieces, applying felt tape to contact points, or replacing damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This depends greatly on the source and severity of the rattles, and whether you can fix it yourself, or need to pay a mechanic.
