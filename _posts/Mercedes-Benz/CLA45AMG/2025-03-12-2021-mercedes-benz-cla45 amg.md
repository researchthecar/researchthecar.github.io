The 2021 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG is a high-performance compact sedan/coupe known for its potent engine and sporty handling. The CLA lineup also includes the CLA250 with a less powerful engine. The CLA45 AMG boasts a hand-built 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 382 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praise its blistering acceleration, sharp handling, and stylish design. Some common complaints revolve around the firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M139)**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels diligently and addressing any leaks or underlying issues. Some cases may require replacing piston rings or other engine components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of turbocharger failure. Symptoms can include loss of power, unusual noises (whining or screeching) from the engine bay, and potentially check engine light illumination.
    * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (DCT)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This can manifest as a noticeable lurch or hesitation during gear changes.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission components may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ for software updates, $1,000+ for transmission repairs.
