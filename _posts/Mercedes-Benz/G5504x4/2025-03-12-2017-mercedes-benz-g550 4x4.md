The 2017 Mercedes-Benz G550 4x4 Squared is an ultra-capable off-road vehicle known for its portal axles, massive ground clearance, and luxurious interior. It's powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 416 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. While owners often praise its unique styling, off-road prowess, and powerful engine, some common dislikes include its high price tag, poor fuel economy, and cumbersome handling in everyday driving. It is important to note that the G550 4x4 Squared shares many components with other G-Class models, so some issues may be applicable across the range.

**Summary**

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz G550 4x4 Squared, while highly desirable for its off-road capabilities and luxury, can present owners with a range of potential issues. The most common issues revolve around the engine (oil leaks, turbo issues), transmission (valve body), suspension (portal axle seals, ride height control), and electrical systems (sensor failures, central locking system). Repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for turbocharger or transmission work. Rust can also be a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in potential maintenance costs when considering the purchase of a used G550 4x4 Squared.
