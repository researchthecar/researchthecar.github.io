### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mercedes-Benz SL450 generally demonstrates good reliability, particularly with its powertrain. The 3.0L twin-turbo V6 engine and 9-speed automatic transmission are robust. Potential areas of concern are primarily related to the sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, which can develop fluid leaks or pump issues, and the retractable hardtop mechanism, which may require adjustments or component replacement. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted possibilities. Interior issues are less common but can include climate control blower motor failures. Overall, while not immune to problems, the SL450's reliability is largely in line with expectations for a high-end luxury convertible, with most issues being repairable, albeit potentially costly due to the specialized nature of the components.
