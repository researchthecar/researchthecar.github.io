**Summary**

The 2013 Mercedes-Benz E350, while a luxurious and comfortable vehicle, can be prone to certain issues. Engine issues like oil leaks and timing chain tensioner problems can be costly, as can transmission problems related to the valve body and torque converter. Air suspension failures are also a potential expense if the vehicle is equipped with that option. Electrical gremlins with the COMAND system, battery drain, and electronic steering lock can also arise. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection and awareness of potential maintenance needs essential for prospective buyers. The severity of the issues range from minor inconveniences to significant mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the issue.
