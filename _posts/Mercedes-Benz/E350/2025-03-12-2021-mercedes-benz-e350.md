The 2021 Mercedes-Benz E350 is a luxury sedan known for its sophisticated styling, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. The E350 comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine that produces 255 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2021 E-Class include a 3.0-liter inline-6 and a 4.0-liter V8, depending on the trim level. All engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically praise the E350 for its refined interior, smooth handling, and abundance of features. However, some common complaints include the complexity of the infotainment system and the high cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Summary**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz E350 generally has a good reputation, but owners have reported some common issues, primarily related to the electrical system (MBUX glitches, battery drain), interior components (sunroof and seat noises), and occasionally, the transmission (rough shifting) or air suspension (if equipped). While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, such as replacing the MBUX unit or air suspension components, can be costly. Severity ranges from minor annoyances to potentially impacting vehicle drivability.
