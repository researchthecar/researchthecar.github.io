The 2007 Mercedes-Benz E350 is a popular luxury sedan known for its blend of comfort, performance, and technology. It features a 3.5L V6 engine producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2007 E-Class include a 3.0L V6 diesel engine in the E320 Bluetec, a 5.5L V8 in the E550, and a supercharged 5.4L V8 in the E63 AMG. All engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the E350 for its smooth ride, elegant interior, and composed handling. However, some common complaints include electrical issues, particularly with the electronic systems and sensors, as well as potential problems with the engine and transmission.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (M272)**

*   **Balance Shaft Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The most common issue for the M272 engine is premature wear of the balance shaft sprocket, leading to a "Check Engine" light with codes P0016 and P0017 (crankshaft/camshaft timing misalignment). This can also cause rough running, loss of power, and eventually engine damage if left unaddressed. The issue primarily affects engines produced between 2004 and 2008.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the balance shaft with an updated part. This is a labor-intensive job requiring engine removal or partial disassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Cam Magnet) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the camshaft adjuster solenoids (also known as cam magnets) can occur. Oil can wick through the wiring harness and contaminate the ME (Motor Electronics) control unit. Symptoms include oil drips, visible oil on the solenoids, and potential for misfires or other engine management issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking cam magnets and installing a harness adapter (oil stop cable) to prevent oil from wicking into the ECU. In severe cases, the ECU may also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on if the ECU needs replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Runner Flap Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the intake manifold runner flap motor can cause a "Check Engine" light and can affect engine performance, particularly at lower RPMs. Codes P2004, P2005, P2006, and P2007 are common. The motor controls flaps within the intake manifold that optimize airflow.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold runner flap motor or, in some cases, the entire intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6 Diesel (OM642)**
* **Oil Cooler Seal Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The oil cooler seals on the OM642 diesel engine are prone to leaking. This can result in significant oil loss, visible oil drips, and a burning oil smell. The oil cooler is located in the V of the engine, making access difficult.
    * Solution: Replacing the oil cooler seals. This is a labor-intensive job that requires removing the turbocharger and other components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.5L V8 (M273)**
*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Cam Magnet) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the camshaft adjuster solenoids (also known as cam magnets) can occur. Oil can wick through the wiring harness and contaminate the ME (Motor Electronics) control unit. Symptoms include oil drips, visible oil on the solenoids, and potential for misfires or other engine management issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking cam magnets and installing a harness adapter (oil stop cable) to prevent oil from wicking into the ECU. In severe cases, the ECU may also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on if the ECU needs replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 722.9 transmission can experience valve body issues, leading to harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, and erratic behavior. This is often caused by worn solenoids or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body or rebuilding it with new solenoids and seals. Performing regular transmission fluid changes can help prevent this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate, which houses the transmission speed sensors and other electronic components, can fail. This can result in a loss of gear selection, limp mode, and various transmission-related error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the conductor plate and potentially the associated speed sensors. This requires dropping the transmission pan and accessing the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic System Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with the Airmatic air suspension system, common issues include air leaks from the air struts or air lines, compressor failure, and sagging suspension. This can lead to a rough ride, uneven ride height, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air struts or air lines, replacing the air compressor, and/or addressing any issues with the Airmatic control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ per strut (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EIS, also known as the electronic ignition switch, is a common failure point. Symptoms include difficulty starting the car, the key not being recognized, or the car starting and then immediately stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the EIS and reprogramming it to match the vehicle's keys. This often requires specialized equipment and expertise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM modules (front and rear) control various electrical functions and are prone to failure due to water intrusion or electrical overload. Symptoms can include malfunctioning lights, wipers, power windows, or other electrical accessories.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the faulty SAM module and replacing it. Reprogramming may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Pump Relay Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden stalling or failure to start can be caused by a faulty fuel pump relay. The relay is located in the rear SAM module.
    *   Solution: Replacing the fuel pump relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators can fail, resulting in doors that won't lock or unlock properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the sunroof mechanism, including the tracks, motor, and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Navigation System/COMAND Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The COMAND system (Cockpit Management and Data system) can experience glitches, screen failures, or issues with the navigation system.
    *   Solution: Depending on the issue, the COMAND unit may need to be repaired, replaced, or reprogrammed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
