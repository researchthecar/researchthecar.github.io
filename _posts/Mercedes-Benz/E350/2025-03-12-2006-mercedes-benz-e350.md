The most prevalent issues involve the engine (especially the balance shaft problem in the 3.5L V6), the 7-speed transmission valve body, Airmatic suspension failures (if equipped), and various electrical problems. Repairs can be costly, so pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance are essential. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures that require extensive repairs. Potential repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls.
