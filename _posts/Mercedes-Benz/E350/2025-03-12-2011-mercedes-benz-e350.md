**Summary**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz E350 is generally a reliable luxury car, but some common issues can arise as the vehicle ages. Electrical problems with the EIS and SAM modules can be costly to fix, and issues with the 7-speed transmission and air suspension (if equipped) are also relatively common. The engine is generally reliable, but oil leaks and camshaft adjuster solenoid failures are potential issues. The severity of these issues varies, but some repairs can be quite expensive, so a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2011 E350 is recommended.
