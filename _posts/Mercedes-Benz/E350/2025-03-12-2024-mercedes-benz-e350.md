The 2024 Mercedes-Benz E350 is a luxury sedan that offers a blend of comfort, technology, and performance. The E350 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2024 E-Class include the E450, with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine with mild hybrid drive, and the AMG E53 with a more powerful version of the inline-6 engine. All engines are paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the E-Class for its luxurious interior, advanced technology features (like the MBUX infotainment system), and smooth ride. Common dislikes often revolve around the high price point, complex infotainment system, and occasional electronic glitches.
