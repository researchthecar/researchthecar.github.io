Many owners appreciate the E350's smooth ride and luxurious interior, but some common complaints include electrical issues, and certain engine-related problems.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 Engine**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, reduced engine power, and potential stalling. Faulty camshaft adjuster solenoids can cause incorrect camshaft timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Balance Shaft Gear Wear (Affects early production models)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough engine running, and metallic rattling noises, especially on startup. Premature wear of the balance shaft gear can lead to engine damage if left unaddressed. Affected vehicles were generally produced before mid-2007.
    *   Solution: Engine removal and replacement of the balance shaft, along with related components like timing chain and gears.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, and potential limp-home mode. The valve body controls fluid pressure to different parts of the transmission and can develop internal leaks or electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild, including replacement of solenoids and conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during acceleration. Potential stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting unevenly, longer time to raise or lower suspension, suspension malfunction warning light. Compressor wear or leaks in the air lines can cause failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the airmatic suspension compressor and addressing any air leaks in the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hissing sound near the affected strut, vehicle sitting lower on one side, rough ride. Air struts can develop leaks over time, causing ride height and comfort issues.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with various electrical components, such as lights, wipers, power windows, or door locks. SAM modules control many of the car's electrical functions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty SAM module (front or rear), followed by replacement and reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz E350 offers a luxurious driving experience, but prospective buyers should be aware of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with early production 3.5L V6 engines, can be expensive to repair. Transmission valve body issues and electrical gremlins with the EIS and SAM modules are also common and can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension issues on models with Airmatic can also be costly. While not all E350s will experience these problems, a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is recommended.
