### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz E350 (W211) is a well-built luxury vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of specific common issues. The M272 V6 engine is prone to intake manifold runner flap failures and balance shaft gear wear, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the conductor plate and valve body in the 7-speed automatic, are also notable. While the standard suspension is generally reliable, the optional Airmatic system can be a source of expensive repairs. Electrical issues, often related to the SAM unit, can manifest as various gremlins. Interior issues like clogged sunroof drains are manageable but require attention. Despite these potential pitfalls, many E350s have proven to be reliable with proper maintenance and addressing these known issues.
