### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz G500 is a highly durable vehicle, but its age and complexity mean that certain components can develop issues. The powertrain, particularly the 5.0L V8 engine and 5-speed automatic transmission, is generally robust but can experience problems with ignition coils, oil cooler seals, and transmission control modules. Electrical systems, especially the BCM and window regulators, are also noted areas for potential concern. Suspension components like ball joints and shocks are subject to wear, as are interior features such as seat heaters and blower motors. Proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly are key to maintaining the G500's legendary reliability.
