### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz G500 is a highly capable and generally robust vehicle. Its V8 engine and drivetrain are known for their longevity, though specific components like ignition coils and MAF sensors can require attention. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while generally reliable, can experience issues with its control module or conductor plate. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and bushings, are common wear items on older G-Wagens. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window regulators, can also arise. Interior components like leather upholstery and climate control actuators may also need repair or replacement due to age. Overall, the G500 demands diligent maintenance and can incur significant repair costs for specific issues, but its core mechanical integrity remains a strong point.
