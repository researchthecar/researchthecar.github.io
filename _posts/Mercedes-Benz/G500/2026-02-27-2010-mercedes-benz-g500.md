### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz G500 is a highly durable vehicle with a strong reputation for reliability, especially in its core mechanical components like the engine and transmission. However, as with any vehicle of this age, owners should be aware of potential issues that can arise. Common concerns include coolant leaks from the intake manifold and oil leaks from valve cover gaskets on the 5.5L V8 engine. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and control arm bushings, may require attention due to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulator failures and infotainment system glitches, are also noted. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are generally manageable and do not detract from the G500's overall robust nature. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are key to maintaining its legendary status.
