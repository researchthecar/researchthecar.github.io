The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G500 represents a blend of rugged off-road capability and luxurious appointments. The G500 came equipped with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 416 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. While the G-Wagon offers exceptional off-road prowess, its boxy design also contributes to wind noise and a less-than-agile on-road driving experience. Owners often appreciate its iconic styling and luxurious interior, but some may find the fuel economy and relatively firm ride to be drawbacks. It came equipped with a 7-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G500, while a capable and luxurious vehicle, can present owners with a range of issues. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger problems are common concerns, while the transmission can exhibit rough shifting. Air suspension problems are another potential source of expense. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and COMAND system glitches, can also occur. Door lock actuators and sunroof malfunctions are additional points of concern. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor to more costly repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
