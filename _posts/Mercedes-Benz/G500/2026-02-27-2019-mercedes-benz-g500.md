### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz G500 demonstrates commendable reliability for a luxury SUV, with its core powertrain components (4.0L V8 engine and 9G-TRONIC transmission) showing very few reported issues. The primary areas where minor concerns have surfaced are within the suspension (occasional clunking from the front independent setup), electrical systems (infotainment glitches and LED headlight issues), and some exterior/interior components like door handles and climate control. These issues are generally not critical failures but can impact the ownership experience and incur repair costs. Overall, the G500 is a robust vehicle, but owners should budget for potential repairs related to its complex systems and premium features.
