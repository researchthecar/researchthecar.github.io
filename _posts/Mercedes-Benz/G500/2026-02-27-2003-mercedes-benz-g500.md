### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz G500 is a highly capable and durable vehicle, but its complexity means certain components can be prone to failure as they age. The engine and transmission are generally robust, but specific electrical components like the TCM and BCM, along with suspension parts such as ball joints and control arm bushings, are common areas for concern. Electrical gremlins and issues with the adjustable ride height system (if equipped) can also arise. While not overwhelmingly problematic, owners should budget for potential repairs, particularly for the electrical and suspension systems, to maintain the G500's legendary performance and comfort.
