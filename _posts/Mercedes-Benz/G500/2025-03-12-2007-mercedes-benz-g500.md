The 2007 Mercedes-Benz G500 is a legendary SUV known for its ruggedness, off-road capabilities, and luxurious appointments. For the 2007 model year, the G500 was primarily equipped with a 5.0L V8 engine, producing around 292 horsepower and 336 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the G500 for its iconic design, robust construction, and go-anywhere attitude. However, some common dislikes include its relatively poor fuel economy, high maintenance costs, and less-than-stellar on-road handling compared to more modern SUVs.
