### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz G500 is a highly durable vehicle, especially in its core mechanical components. The 5.5L V8 engine is generally reliable, though common issues like intake manifold runner flap actuator failure and oil leaks can occur with age and mileage. The 7G-TRONIC transmission is robust but can suffer from fluid leaks or torque converter problems. Suspension components, particularly bushings, may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon in luxury vehicles of this era. Interior wear on leather is also a consideration. Overall, the G500 offers strong reliability for its class, but owners should be prepared for potential repairs on specific systems as it ages.
