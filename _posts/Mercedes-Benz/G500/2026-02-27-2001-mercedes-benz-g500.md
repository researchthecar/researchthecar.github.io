### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mercedes-Benz G500 is a highly durable vehicle, but its age means certain components are prone to failure. The V8 engine is generally robust, though ignition coils and MAF sensors can require attention. Transmission issues, particularly with the TCM and conductor plate, are not uncommon and can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and window regulators, are also reported. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shocks may need replacement due to wear. While the exterior and interior are typically well-built, specific items like HVAC blend doors can fail. Overall, the G500 remains a capable machine, but owners should be prepared for potential repairs, especially concerning its complex electrical and transmission systems.
