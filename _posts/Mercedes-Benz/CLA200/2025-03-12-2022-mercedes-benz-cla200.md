The 2022 Mercedes-Benz CLA200 is a stylish and sporty compact coupe/sedan that offers a blend of luxury and performance. While the CLA200 is powered by a 1.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 163 horsepower and 250 Nm of torque, other engine options available for the CLA range include a more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine in the CLA250 and high-performance AMG variants. Transmission options typically include a 7-speed or 8-speed dual-clutch automatic. Owners generally appreciate the CLA's sleek design, comfortable interior, and modern technology, but some criticisms include a firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and potentially high maintenance costs.
