The 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLA200 is a stylish compact sedan known for its coupe-like silhouette and luxurious features. The CLA200 is powered by a 1.3-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 163 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available in some markets include more powerful gasoline engines and diesel variants. Transmission options typically include a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the CLA's attractive design, comfortable interior, and fuel efficiency. Common complaints include a firm ride, limited rear headroom, and the higher cost of maintenance and repairs associated with luxury vehicles.

* **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation upon acceleration or even stalling, especially at lower speeds. This may be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    * Solution: Diagnostic scan to check for fault codes related to fuel delivery, ignition, or sensors. Solutions could range from sensor replacement to fuel system cleaning.
