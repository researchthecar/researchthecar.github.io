### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA200 presents a generally solid reliability record, particularly in its suspension, exterior, and interior components, which show no widespread issues. However, potential owners should be aware of specific concerns within the powertrain and electrical systems. The engines, particularly the 1.6L, can experience turbocharger and PCV valve issues, while the 2.0L might see water pump leaks. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission is susceptible to mechatronics unit failures and fluid leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also noted. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not universally present. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate these potential problems.
