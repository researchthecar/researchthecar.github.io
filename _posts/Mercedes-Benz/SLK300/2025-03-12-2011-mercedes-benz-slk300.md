The 2011 Mercedes-Benz SLK300 is a sporty roadster known for its retractable hardtop, offering open-air driving with the security of a coupe. The SLK300 features a 3.0-liter V6 engine producing 228 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options included a supercharged 1.8L inline-4 in the SLK200 and SLK250 models, and a 3.5L V6 in the SLK350. The SLK55 AMG came with a powerful 5.5L V8. Owners often praise the car's stylish design, comfortable ride, and the retractable hardtop feature.
