The 2014 Mercedes-Benz GLK250 BlueTEC is a compact luxury SUV known for its fuel efficiency thanks to its diesel engine. Other engine options available for the 2014 GLK class are the GLK350, which comes with a 3.5L V6 gasoline engine that produces 302 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. The GLK250 BlueTEC diesel engine produces 190 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the GLK250's comfortable ride, premium interior, and relatively good fuel economy for an SUV. Common complaints often revolve around the diesel emissions system and the higher maintenance costs associated with the diesel engine.

**Engine**

**2.1L Diesel (OM651)**

*   **AdBlue Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AdBlue heater, used to prevent the Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) from freezing in cold temperatures, can fail. This can trigger a check engine light and potentially put the vehicle into limp mode, particularly in colder climates. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to the DEF system will be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the AdBlue heater. In some cases, the entire DEF tank needs to be replaced as the heater is integrated into it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits, leading to rough idling, poor performance, and a check engine light. Common DTCs include those related to EGR flow or valve position.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve. In severe cases, the EGR cooler may also need to be cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, especially with frequent short trips. This results in reduced engine performance, a DPF warning light, and potentially limp mode.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (either through a scan tool or driving at sustained high speeds) or replacement of the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300 for forced regeneration at a shop. $1000 - $3000+ for DPF replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, particularly at low speeds. Can also cause rough shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, flushing the transmission and replacing the fluid and filter can temporarily alleviate the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, or getting stuck in a gear. These problems are often caused by worn solenoids or other components within the valve body.
    *   Solution: Replacement or remanufacturing of the valve body. Sometimes individual solenoids can be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Glow Plug Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting in cold weather, check engine light. Typically accompanied by DTCs related to glow plug circuit issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the glow plug module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days of non-use. Requires jump-starting or frequent battery charging. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the parasitic draw. This often involves using a multimeter to identify the circuit causing the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof gets stuck, makes excessive noise, or fails to open/close properly. The mechanism can become misaligned or the motor can fail.
    *   Solution: Sunroof track cleaning and lubrication. Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor or other components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Mercedes-Benz GLK250 BlueTEC can be a good vehicle, but prospective buyers should be aware of potential issues, particularly related to the diesel emissions system and the 7G-Tronic transmission. The diesel engine can suffer from issues with the AdBlue system, EGR valve, and DPF which can be costly to repair. The 7G-Tronic transmission can also have issues that can be costly to repair. While some electrical issues can occur, they are generally less expensive to address. Overall, potential owners should budget for higher-than-average maintenance costs, especially compared to the GLK350 with the gasoline engine.
