The 2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK250 Bluetec 4MATIC is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency thanks to its diesel engine. Other engine options for the 2013 GLK included the GLK350 with a 3.5L V6 gasoline engine producing 302 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. The GLK250's 2.1L inline-4 turbodiesel engine produces 190 horsepower and a robust 369 lb-ft of torque, offering ample low-end grunt for everyday driving. All models were equipped with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the GLK's solid build quality, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior. Some common dislikes include the somewhat boxy styling and the relatively small cargo area compared to some competitors.
