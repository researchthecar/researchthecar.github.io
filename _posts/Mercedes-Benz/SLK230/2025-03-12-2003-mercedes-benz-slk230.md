The 2003 Mercedes-Benz SLK230 is a sporty and stylish roadster known for its retractable hardtop, offering the open-air experience of a convertible with the security and comfort of a coupe. The SLK230 features a 2.3-liter supercharged inline-4 engine producing 190 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for this year include a 3.2 liter V6 found in the SLK320, and a 5.4 liter supercharged V8 found in the SLK32 AMG.
