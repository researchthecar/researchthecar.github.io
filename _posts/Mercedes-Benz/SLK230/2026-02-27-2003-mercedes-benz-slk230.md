### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz SLK230 offers a compelling blend of performance and style, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The engine, particularly the supercharger belt and MAF sensor, can require attention. Transmission issues, especially with the automatic control module, are a notable concern. The retractable hardtop system is a complex feature prone to hydraulic leaks and sensor problems, which can be costly to repair. Electrical components like window regulators and headlight switches can also fail. While the chassis and interior are generally robust, wear on suspension components and occasional electrical gremlins are to be expected with age. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to reported issues are crucial for maintaining this sporty roadster.
