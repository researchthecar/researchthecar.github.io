### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz SLK230 is a stylish roadster with a generally solid mechanical foundation, particularly its 2.3L supercharged engine and 5-speed automatic transmission, which do not suffer from widespread critical failures. However, its most distinctive feature, the retractable hardtop, is a common source of expensive repairs due to hydraulic system issues and seal degradation. Electrical components, such as window regulators and headlight switches, can also develop faults. Interior wear, especially on seats, is typical for a car of this age. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the convertible top mechanism and be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with its age and complexity.
