The 2002 Mercedes-Benz SLK230 Kompressor is a stylish and sporty roadster known for its retractable hardtop, providing open-air driving with the security of a coupe. The most common engine is a 2.3L supercharged inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 190 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission were the available options. Owners often praise the SLK230 for its fun driving dynamics and unique top, while some complaints revolve around the cost of maintenance and occasional reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2002 Mercedes-Benz SLK230 can suffer from a variety of issues. Engine issues can range from simple sensor replacements to more expensive supercharger repairs. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic transmission, are not uncommon. Suspension components wear out over time, requiring replacement of bushings and ball joints. Electrical gremlins can also appear, particularly with the central locking system and convertible top operation. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, especially those involving the convertible top hydraulic system or major engine/transmission work. Owners should be prepared for the potential cost of maintaining a vehicle of this age and complexity.
