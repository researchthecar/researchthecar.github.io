The 2019 Mercedes-Benz V220d is a popular choice for those needing a spacious and luxurious people-carrier. It offers a comfortable ride and a premium interior, making it suitable for families and business use. The V220d is powered by a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel engine producing 163 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the V-Class in 2019 included the V250d (more powerful diesel) and, in some markets, petrol engines. All were typically paired with a 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission. Owners often praise the V-Class for its spaciousness, versatility, and comfortable ride. However, common complaints include the vehicle's size (making it challenging to park in tight spaces), occasional electronic glitches, and relatively high running costs.

**Engine**

**2.1L Diesel (OM651)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are reported, often originating from the oil cooler or turbocharger seals. Symptoms include visible oil puddles under the vehicle, oil consumption, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty seals or gaskets. In more severe cases, the oil cooler or turbocharger may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the source of the leak and parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, particularly with frequent short trips. Symptoms include reduced engine performance, the DPF warning light illuminating, and potentially limp mode.
    *   Solution: Attempting a forced regeneration of the DPF. In severe cases, the DPF may need to be professionally cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for forced regeneration, $500 - $2000+ for cleaning or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC PLUS Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rough or delayed shifting, especially when shifting between gears at lower speeds. This can manifest as jerky movements or hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body issues or internal transmission damage might require repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 for fluid flush and filter, $1000 - $4000+ for valve body repair/replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with air suspension, owners report issues such as the vehicle sagging on one side, uneven ride height, or the air compressor failing.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the air suspension system to identify leaks, faulty sensors, or a failing compressor. Replacement of the affected components is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2500+ depending on the component needing replacement (air struts, compressor, sensors).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with excessive battery drain, particularly if the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle or a completely dead battery.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Multiple sensor malfunctions have been reported, including but not limited to parking sensors, tire pressure sensors, and rain sensors. Symptoms vary depending on the affected sensor, but may include warning lights, inaccurate readings, or malfunctioning features.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the affected sensor and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ depending on the sensor in question.

**Summary**

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz V220d can experience various issues, with the engine, transmission, and electrical systems being the most common areas of concern. Oil leaks, DPF issues, and rough shifting are prevalent problems. Air suspension issues, if equipped, can also be costly to repair. Electrical glitches, particularly related to battery drain and sensor malfunctions, also occur. While the V220d offers comfort and space, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of repairs and maintenance. The severity and cost of these repairs range from minor sensor replacements to major engine or transmission overhauls, impacting the overall ownership experience.
