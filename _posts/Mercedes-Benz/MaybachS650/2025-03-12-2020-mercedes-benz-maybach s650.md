The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Maybach S650 is the epitome of luxury and refinement, offering an unparalleled driving experience. While lauded for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and powerful performance, some owners have reported certain issues. The S650 is equipped with a handcrafted 6.0-liter biturbo V12 engine that delivers 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7G-TRONIC seven-speed automatic transmission. Standard features include almost every premium option available on a standard S-Class. However, some owners dislike the high cost of maintenance and the complexity of the advanced technology, which can lead to occasional malfunctions.
