The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Maybach S650 represents the pinnacle of luxury and refinement in the automotive world. It's powered by a hand-built 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 engine producing 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired exclusively with a 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally praise the Maybach S650 for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and powerful engine, some have reported encountering certain issues. Common complaints include the complexity of the infotainment system and occasional glitches in the advanced driver-assistance systems. A smaller, less powerful V8 engine was also available in the S560 trim, but the S650 is the focus here, being the top-of-the-line model.
