**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz FS65, primarily used as a commercial vehicle, faces common issues associated with diesel engines, heavy-duty transmissions, and chassis components. Engine issues like fuel injector and turbocharger failures, coupled with potential transmission slipping, can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension problems, particularly with air suspension systems (if equipped) or leaf springs, can impact ride quality and require attention. Electrical gremlins stemming from wiring harness issues can be frustrating to diagnose and repair. Rust can also be a significant concern in regions with heavy road salt usage. Depending on the severity, repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major overhauls. Regular maintenance and inspections are crucial for mitigating these issues and ensuring the vehicle's longevity.
