### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz FS65 demonstrates a strong foundation of reliability, characteristic of its commercial-grade engineering. The OM 457 LA engine, while powerful, can experience issues with its turbocharger and EGR system, which are not uncommon for high-mileage diesel engines. Manual transmissions, particularly the GO 230, may show wear in synchronizers over time. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, are subject to stress and potential breakage under heavy use. Electrical systems can develop faults due to corrosion, and the alternator is a potential failure point. Exterior corrosion is a concern in harsh climates. Interior issues are generally minor, with the HVAC blower motor being a notable component that may require attention. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the FS65 remains a dependable workhorse.
