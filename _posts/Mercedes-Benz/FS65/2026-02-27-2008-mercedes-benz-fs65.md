### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz FS65 is a dependable chassis platform, particularly noted for its robust engine and transmission options. While issues like EGR malfunctions and turbocharger wear can occur with the OM906LA and OM926LA engines, and transmission fluid leaks or torque converter problems are not uncommon with Allison automatics, these are often manageable with timely maintenance and repair. Suspension components, especially air springs, may require attention due to leaks. Electrical system reliability is generally good, though wiring harness issues can arise. Exterior corrosion on the chassis is a potential concern in certain climates. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor are typical wear items. Overall, the FS65 offers good long-term reliability for its intended heavy-duty use, provided it receives consistent and appropriate servicing.
