### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz FS65 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain and chassis components, which are built for demanding commercial use. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the air suspension system (leaks, compressor issues) and potential electrical gremlins like wiring harness corrosion, which are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and type. Engine-specific problems, such as turbocharger or injector issues, can arise but are often manageable with timely maintenance. Transmission reliability is generally strong, though clutch wear on manual units and torque converter issues on automatics are noted. Proactive inspection and maintenance, especially for the air suspension and electrical systems, are recommended to ensure continued dependable service.
