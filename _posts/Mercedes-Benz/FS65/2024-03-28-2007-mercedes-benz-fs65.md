**Introduction:** The 2007 Mercedes-Benz FS65 is a high-performance, full-size SUV that was offered with only one engine and transmission option. The vehicle is known for its luxurious interior, powerful engine, and advanced safety features. However, like any vehicle, the FS65 has experienced some issues over the years.

**Engine**

* **5.5L V12 Bi-Turbo**
    * **Intake Manifold Failure:** The intake manifold can crack or warp, causing a loss of power and poor fuel economy. Replacing the intake manifold is the solution, costing between $1,500 - $2,500+.
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbochargers can fail prematurely, leading to reduced engine power and increased oil consumption. Replacing the turbochargers is a major repair, costing around $5,000 - $7,000+ per side.
Recalls: Recall #14V363000

**Transmission**

* **7-Speed Automatic:**
    * **Transmission Fluid Leak:** The transmission can develop a leak in the fluid lines or seals, causing a loss of fluid and potential transmission damage. Repairing the leak typically involves replacing the affected components and costs between $500 - $1,000+.
    * **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing shuddering, slipping, and transmission overheating. Replacing the torque converter is a complex repair, costing around $2,000 - $3,000+.
    * **Valve Body Failure:** The valve body can malfunction, leading to shifting issues, delayed engagement, and harsh shifts. Replacing the valve body is a costly repair, ranging from $1,500 - $2,500+.

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure:** The air suspension system can fail due to leaks in the air lines, struts, or compressor. This can result in the vehicle sagging or riding too low, affecting handling and ride comfort. Repairing the air suspension system can be expensive, costing around $2,000 - $4,000+.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely due to faulty components or software issues. Identifying and replacing the affected parts or updating the software typically resolves the issue, costing around $200 - $500+.
* **Electrical Harness Issues:** The electrical harness can develop defects or corrosion, causing electrical malfunctions in various systems. Repairing or replacing the affected sections of the harness can range from $500 - $1,500+.

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** The headlights can develop condensation inside the housing, impairing visibility. Replacing the affected headlight assemblies is the recommended solution, costing around $1,000 - $2,000+ per assembly.

**Interior**

* **Infotainment System Malfunctions:** The infotainment system can experience software glitches or hardware failures, leading to issues with navigation, audio, and other features. Updating the software or replacing the affected components resolves the issue, costing around $500 - $1,500+.
    * **Navigation System Malfunction:** The navigation system can malfunction due to map data errors or software issues, resulting in incorrect directions or system crashes. Updating the maps or software typically solves the problem, costing around $200 - $500.
* **Power Seat Failure:** The power seats can develop mechanical failures or electrical issues, causing difficulty adjusting or operating the seats. Replacing the affected components or repairing the electrical system solves the problem, costing around $500 - $1,000+.

**Summary:** The 2007 Mercedes-Benz FS65 is a luxurious and powerful SUV, but it has experienced a few issues over the years. The most common problems include intake manifold failure, turbocharger failure, and transmission fluid leaks. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, and it's important to factor in the potential maintenance expenses when considering this vehicle.
