The 2006 Mercedes-Benz FS65 is a bus chassis, primarily used for school buses and shuttle buses. While the FS65 isn't known for its luxurious features, owners often appreciate its reliability, durability, and robust construction. On the other hand, potential drawbacks include its age, potential maintenance costs associated with commercial vehicles, and the relatively basic interior and features. Since this is a chassis used to build buses, issues depend heavily on the specific upfitter and final bus configuration. However, common issues related to the Mercedes-Benz chassis itself can be identified. There are limited options for engine or transmission selection on this chassis, but depending on the upfitter, other parts may vary. Most configurations used the Mercedes-Benz OM906LA inline-6 diesel engine paired with an Allison automatic transmission. The OM906LA produces around 275 horsepower and 700 lb-ft of torque.

**Summary**

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz FS65, while a reliable chassis, can exhibit issues common to commercial vehicles of its age. Engine issues primarily revolve around the OM906LA diesel engine's fuel injectors and turbocharger. Transmission problems can stem from the Allison automatic transmission, potentially requiring significant repairs or even replacement. Suspension and electrical issues are also common, while rust can affect the exterior. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, but addressing these issues promptly is crucial for maintaining the vehicle's reliability and safety.
