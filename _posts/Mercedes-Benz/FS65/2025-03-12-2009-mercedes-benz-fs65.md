The 2009 Mercedes-Benz FS65 is a somewhat niche vehicle, being a stripped chassis typically used for commercial bus or shuttle applications. Information specific to common owner complaints about this model is scarce due to its specialized use. However, we can look at potential issues based on the components used in the vehicle. The FS65 was commonly equipped with the Mercedes-Benz OM906LA inline-6 diesel engine. This engine produced around 280 horsepower and 700 lb-ft of torque. It was typically paired with an Allison automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the robust nature of the chassis and the reliability of the Mercedes-Benz diesel engine, but may dislike the limited parts availability and the cost of specialized repairs.

**Engine**

**OM906LA Inline-6 Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, excessive smoke, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine misfire. Can lead to damage to other engine components if left unresolved.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty injectors. Proper diagnosis is essential to ensure correct replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+ per injector (including labor).

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, whistling noises from the turbo, and potential oil leaks. Can lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage. Repair or replace the turbocharger as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (including labor and parts).

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, increased emissions, rough idle, and potential engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. Ensure proper operation after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (including labor and parts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison Automatic Transmission**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement, slipping between gears, harsh or erratic shifting, and potential transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify specific issues (valve body, solenoids, etc.). Repair or replace the affected components, or rebuild the transmission if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and repairs).

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling when stopped, poor acceleration, and potential transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Flush the transmission cooler lines to remove debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (including labor and parts).

*   **Fluid Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leaks, low fluid level, poor shifting performance, and potential transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak (seals, lines, pan gasket). Replace the leaking components and refill with the correct transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the location and severity of the leak).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, uneven ride height, compressor failure, and leaks in the air lines or airbags.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the leak or failure. Replace the faulty components (airbags, compressor, lines, sensors).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on the affected component and repair complexity).

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and decreased braking performance.
    *   Solution: Replace worn shocks or struts. Consider replacing in pairs for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per axle (including labor and parts).

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Electrical shorts, intermittent failures, and potential engine or transmission control issues.
    *   Solution: Inspect the wiring harness for damage. Repair or replace damaged sections of the harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the repair).

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty readings, check engine light illumination, and potential engine or transmission performance issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor using a scan tool. Replace the sensor as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor (including labor and parts).

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (especially in northern climates)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the body panels, frame, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace affected panels. Apply rust inhibitors to prevent further corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the rust damage).

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak airflow, temperature control problems, and faulty blower motor operation.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the problem (compressor, blower motor, blend door actuator, etc.). Repair or replace the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the issue).

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz FS65, primarily used as a bus chassis, can experience issues related to its diesel engine (fuel injectors, turbocharger, EGR valve) and Allison transmission (slipping, harsh shifting, torque converter problems). Suspension and electrical issues can also arise. The severity and cost of these issues can vary greatly, but proper maintenance and timely repairs can help ensure the longevity of the vehicle. Given its commercial nature, repair costs can be higher than those for passenger vehicles. While specific data on FS65 owner complaints is limited, these common issues associated with its components should be considered when evaluating the vehicle.
