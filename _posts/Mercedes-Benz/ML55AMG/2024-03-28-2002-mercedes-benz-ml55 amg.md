**Introduction**

The 2002 Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG is a high-performance SUV equipped with a 5.5-liter V8 engine producing 342 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. It offers a combination of luxury, power, and off-road capability. Despite its impressive attributes, the ML55 AMG has encountered several issues reported by owners and mechanics.

**Engine**

* **5.5-Liter V8**
    * **Valve Stem Seal Failure:** Oil leaks from worn valve stem seals, causing increased oil consumption and blue smoke from the exhaust. Replacement of valve stem seals is necessary. $1000 - $1500+
    * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner may fail, leading to camshaft timing issues and engine damage. Replacement of the tensioner and related components is required. $2000 - $3000+
* **5.4-Liter V8**
    * **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Automatic**
    * **Shifting Problems:** Erratic or delayed shifting due to worn or faulty transmission solenoids. Replacing the solenoids or the entire valve body is necessary. $1000 - $2000+
* **7-Speed Automatic**
    * **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** The mechatronic unit, which controls transmission functions, may fail, causing transmission issues such as slipping or refusing to shift. Replacement of the mechatronic unit is required. $4000 - $6000+

**Suspension**

* **Airmatic Suspension Leaks:** Airbags may develop leaks, leading to a loss of suspension height and a rough ride. Replacement of the airbags or compressor is necessary. $1500 - $2500+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge:** Parasitic drain from faulty modules or components may deplete the battery, requiring replacement. Identifying and repairing the source of the drain is necessary. $200 - $1000+
* **Power Window Failure:** Power window motors or switches may fail, causing windows to malfunction. Replacement of the affected components is required. $300 - $800+

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Undercarriage:** Corrosion may occur on the undercarriage, especially in areas exposed to road salt or moisture. Rustproofing or repair of affected areas is necessary. $500 - $2000+

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Malfunction:** Faulty actuators or sensors may cause the climate control system to malfunction, resulting in uneven heating or cooling. Replacement of the affected components is necessary. $500 - $1500+

**Summary**

The Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG faces several issues that can affect its performance, reliability, and overall value. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be severe and costly to repair. Owners should be aware of these potential problems and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs.
