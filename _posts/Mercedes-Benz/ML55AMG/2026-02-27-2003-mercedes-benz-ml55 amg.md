### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG offers a compelling blend of performance and utility, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues that can arise with age. The 5.4L V8 engine, while powerful, can be prone to oil and coolant leaks, and sensors may fail. The 5-speed automatic transmission, particularly its electronic components like the TCM and conductor plate, requires attention. Suspension components, especially if equipped with air suspension, and electrical gremlins like window regulators and instrument clusters are also areas to monitor. Exterior rust and interior wear, such as sagging headliners, are typical for vehicles of this vintage. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the ML55 AMG can remain a rewarding vehicle.
