### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Alliado is a generally reliable luxury vehicle, particularly in its core mechanical components. While specific engine variants like the V6 and V8 have some documented issues such as coolant leaks and turbocharger problems, these are not universally reported and often arise with higher mileage. The 7-speed automatic transmission can experience valve body issues, which are costly but not endemic. The standard suspension is robust, but optional AIRMATIC systems require careful maintenance to avoid expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment, can occur. Overall, the Alliado offers a good balance of luxury and dependability, with most potential issues being manageable with proper upkeep and timely repairs.
