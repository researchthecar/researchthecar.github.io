### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Alliado is a generally reliable luxury vehicle, with most owners experiencing satisfaction. The powertrain, including both the 7-speed and 9-speed automatic transmissions, is robust. However, potential owners should be aware of specific issues that can arise, particularly with the 2.0L turbocharged engine's turbocharger actuator and PCV valve. For models equipped with AIRMATIC air suspension, leaks can be a costly repair. Electrical gremlins, such as COMAND system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also documented concerns. Despite these points, the Alliado's overall reliability remains strong, with most issues being repairable and not indicative of systemic failure across the model range.
