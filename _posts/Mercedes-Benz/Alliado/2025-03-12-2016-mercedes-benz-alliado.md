The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Metris (also known as the Alliado in some markets) is a mid-size van offering a blend of utility and Mercedes-Benz refinement. The 2016 Metris is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7G-TRONIC 7-speed automatic transmission. The Metris is liked for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency relative to larger vans, and cargo capacity. Downsides often mentioned include a firmer ride, limited rear seat legroom in passenger configurations, and certain cost-cutting measures in the interior compared to other Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
