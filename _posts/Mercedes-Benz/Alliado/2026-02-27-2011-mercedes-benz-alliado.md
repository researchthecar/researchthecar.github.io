### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Alliado generally offers good reliability, particularly for its luxury segment. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the diesel engines' emissions systems (DPF, EGR) and the automatic transmission's valve body or torque converter. Petrol engines may see some timing chain wear. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and battery drain, are also noted but are not pervasive. Suspension components, especially if equipped with air suspension, can require attention. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing specific known issues promptly, the Alliado can be a dependable vehicle. However, potential buyers should be aware of the costs associated with repairing these specific components, especially the transmission and turbocharger.
