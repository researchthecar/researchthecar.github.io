### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz Alliado generally offers good reliability, particularly with its core mechanical components. Diesel engines, while robust, can experience issues related to emissions systems like the DPF and EGR valve, and glow plugs can fail, impacting cold starts. The automatic transmission is generally dependable, though solenoid issues can arise. The air suspension system is a notable area where leaks and compressor failures can occur, leading to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon but are typically manageable. Overall, the Alliado is a well-built vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific maintenance needs and potential repair costs associated with its advanced features, especially the air suspension and diesel powertrains.
