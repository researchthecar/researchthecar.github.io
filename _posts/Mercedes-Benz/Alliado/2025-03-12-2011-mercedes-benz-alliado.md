The 2011 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Alliado, a trim that might not be officially recognized, is likely a variant or regional designation within the broader C-Class range. Assuming this refers to the general W204 C-Class produced in 2011, it would have been offered with a range of engines including a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4, a 3.0L V6, and a 3.5L V6. Horsepower figures varied widely depending on the engine, from around 201 hp for the 1.8L to over 300 hp for the 3.5L. Transmission options typically included a 7-speed automatic (7G-TRONIC). Owners generally appreciate the C-Class for its elegant styling, comfortable ride, and prestigious brand image. Common dislikes include higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury brands, and some reported issues with electronic components.

**Summary**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (assuming "Alliado" refers to a C-Class variant) can suffer from a range of issues, some more severe and costly than others. Engine issues like timing chain problems in the 1.8L and intake manifold issues in the 3.5L V6 can be expensive to address. Transmission problems with the 7G-TRONIC can also be significant. Electrical issues, particularly with the SAM and EIS modules, are common and can be frustrating to diagnose and repair. While some issues like suspension bushing failures are relatively inexpensive, others can quickly add up, making careful inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic essential when considering this vehicle.
