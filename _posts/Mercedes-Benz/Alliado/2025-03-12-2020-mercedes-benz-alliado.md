The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB 250 is a compact SUV offering a blend of luxury and practicality. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the GLB's spacious interior for its class, user-friendly technology, and comfortable ride. Common criticisms include occasional lag in throttle response and the somewhat firm ride quality on rough roads.
