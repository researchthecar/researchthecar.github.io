### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz S63L AMG is a highly capable luxury sedan with a generally robust mechanical and electrical system. The primary areas where owners might encounter issues are related to the complex suspension systems (ABC/AIRMATIC) due to potential hydraulic leaks or air spring failures, and the high-performance twin-turbo V8 engine, which can experience issues with turbocharger actuators or coolant leaks. The transmission, while generally reliable, can sometimes present problems with its control module or torque converter. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system or parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Despite these potential concerns, the S63L AMG offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, with most issues being repairable, albeit at a premium cost reflective of the vehicle's class.
