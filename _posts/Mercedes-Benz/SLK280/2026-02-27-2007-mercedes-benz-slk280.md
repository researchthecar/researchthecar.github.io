### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz SLK280 offers a compelling blend of performance and style, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 3.0L V6 engine is susceptible to intake manifold runner flap failures and, more seriously, balance shaft gear wear, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC automatic transmission can experience issues with its control module or torque converter. The complex retractable hardtop system is a notable area for potential expense, with hydraulic leaks and sensor failures being common. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the SAM module, can also arise. While the suspension and interior are generally robust, the engine, transmission, and hardtop are the primary areas to inspect for potential reliability concerns and associated repair costs.
