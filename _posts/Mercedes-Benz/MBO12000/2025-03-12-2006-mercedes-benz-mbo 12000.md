The 2006 Mercedes-Benz ML350 (W164 chassis) is a mid-size luxury SUV that offered a blend of comfort, performance, and utility. Engine options included a 3.5L V6 (M272) producing around 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L V8 (M113). The ML350 was generally liked for its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and capable handling for an SUV. Dislikes often revolved around the higher maintenance costs associated with European luxury vehicles and some reported reliability issues. All engines were paired with a 7G-Tronic (722.9) seven-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (M272)**
*   **Balance Shaft Sprocket Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The balance shaft sprocket can wear prematurely, leading to engine noise, misfires, and eventually engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include a check engine light, rough idling, and a rattling noise from the engine. This issue is more prevalent in earlier production M272 engines.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the balance shaft sprocket, which often involves significant engine disassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Runner Flap Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold has integrated runner flaps that can break, causing a check engine light and decreased engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold. Some aftermarket options offer reinforced flaps to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Cam Magnet) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the camshaft adjuster solenoids, also known as cam magnets. These leaks can drip onto the engine harness and cause damage to the wiring.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam magnets and cleaning of the engine harness. Sometimes the harness needs to be replaced if the damage is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8 (M113)**
* **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks developing from the valve cover gaskets. These leaks can cause burning smells and oil spots under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Air Mass Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air mass sensor can fail, causing driveability issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air mass sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**
*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 722.9 transmission can experience issues with the valve body, leading to rough shifting, delayed engagement, and sometimes complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the valve body. Sometimes a complete transmission replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate inside the transmission can fail, causing similar symptoms to valve body issues, including erratic shifting and being stuck in gear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with Airmatic air suspension can experience leaks in the air struts, compressor failure, and issues with the air distribution valve block. This can lead to the vehicle sitting unevenly, a noisy compressor, and ride height issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaking air struts, compressor, or valve block. Converting to traditional coil springs is also an option, but will change the ride quality.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut; $500 - $1,000+ for the compressor; $300-$700+ for the valve block.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the front lower control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the bushings or the entire control arm.

**Summary**

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz ML350, while offering a luxurious and comfortable experience, can be prone to several issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 3.5L V6 (M272), such as balance shaft and intake manifold failures, can be costly to repair. The 7G-Tronic transmission may also exhibit valve body or conductor plate issues. Suspension problems, especially with the Airmatic system, can be expensive to address. Electrical issues with SAM modules can also arise. While not all vehicles will experience all of these issues, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential maintenance costs when considering a purchase. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the cost of repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific problem and the repair shop.
