The 2010 Mercedes-Benz GLK 350, part of the X204 series, marked Mercedes-Benz's entry into the compact SUV market. It was offered with a 3.5L V6 engine producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). While owners generally appreciated the GLK's comfortable ride, upscale interior, and classic Mercedes-Benz styling, some criticisms included its somewhat firm suspension, limited cargo space compared to competitors, and certain reliability concerns. The GLK350 4Matic came with standard all-wheel drive.

**Summary**

The 2010 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 can present several potential issues. The engine can suffer from costly camshaft adjuster or balance shaft problems, and oil leaks are common. The 7G-Tronic transmission may exhibit valve body, torque converter, or conductor plate failures, leading to shifting problems. Suspension bushings wear out, causing noise and affecting handling. Electrical issues with the EIS and SAM modules can also occur. Exterior rust can be a concern, and interior components like the sunroof and navigation screen may malfunction. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the severity and nature of the problem. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and obtain a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing or potential problems before making a purchase.
