### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz CL65 AMG is a remarkable performance coupe, but its complexity and high-output V12 engine mean that potential buyers should anticipate higher maintenance and repair costs compared to less performance-oriented vehicles. Key areas to monitor include the Active Body Control suspension, twin-turbocharged V12 engine components (especially turbos and intercoolers), and the 5-speed automatic transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND system and various sensors, can also arise. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, specific components like climate control and power seats can develop issues. Thorough pre-purchase inspection by a specialist familiar with AMG models is highly recommended.
