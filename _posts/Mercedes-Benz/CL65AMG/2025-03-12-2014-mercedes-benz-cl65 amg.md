The 2014 Mercedes-Benz CL65 AMG is a high-performance coupe that blends luxury with immense power. It's equipped with a handcrafted 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with an AMG Speedshift 7G-Tronic Plus 7-speed automatic transmission. While owners rave about the incredible acceleration, luxurious interior, and distinctive styling, some common complaints revolve around the high cost of maintenance, complex electronics that can be prone to failure, and the air suspension system's reliability. The CL63 AMG is also available, with a twin-turbo 5.5-liter V8.
