The 2010 Mercedes-Benz CL65 AMG is a high-performance coupe known for its powerful V12 engine and luxurious features. This model year represents the final year of the C216 chassis. While the CL-Class offers impressive performance and comfort, it's also known for its potential maintenance costs and complexity. The CL65 AMG's engine is a hand-built 6.0L Twin-Turbocharged V12 producing 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the CL65's combination of immense power, exclusivity, and elegant design. Some common complaints include high maintenance costs, complex electronics prone to failure, and significant depreciation.

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often stemming from the valve cover gaskets, oil cooler seals, or turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. Thoroughly clean the engine bay after the repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the source and severity of the leak.

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The turbochargers can suffer from premature wear or failure due to high operating temperatures and complex oiling systems. Symptoms include reduced power, turbocharger noise (whining or screeching), and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the turbochargers is the most common solution. Address any underlying oiling issues to prevent recurrence.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ for turbocharger replacement, depending on whether new or remanufactured units are used.

* **Ignition Coil Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Individual ignition coils can fail, leading to misfires and rough running. Symptoms include a check engine light, poor acceleration, and decreased fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s). It's often recommended to replace all coils at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per coil, including labor.

* **Cooling System Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The complex cooling system, including the radiator, water pump, and various hoses, is prone to leaks and failures. Overheating can quickly damage the engine.
    * Solution: Pressure test the system to locate leaks and replace any faulty components. Ensure the cooling system is properly flushed and filled.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the component needing replacement.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience slippage between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, or a complete failure to engage. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid level.
    * Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is burnt or contaminated, a fluid flush and filter change may help. In more severe cases, a valve body rebuild or complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $6000+ (transmission replacement), depending on the extent of the damage.

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The torque converter, responsible for transmitting power from the engine to the transmission, can fail. Symptoms include shuddering, stalling, or a complete loss of drive.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's often recommended to rebuild the transmission at the same time to address any underlying wear.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ depending on if the transmission is being rebuilt as well.

**Suspension**

* **ABC (Active Body Control) Suspension Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The ABC suspension system is known for being complex and prone to leaks and failures. Common issues include sagging suspension, uneven ride height, and error messages on the dashboard. The hydraulic pump, struts, and valve blocks are all potential failure points.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the leak or failure and replace the faulty component. A complete ABC system flush and filter change is also recommended.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the component needing replacement. A new ABC pump can be very expensive.

* **Air Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: These can leak or fail, leading to sagging suspension and a poor ride quality.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty air strut.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+ per strut, including labor.

**Electrical**

* **Electronic Control Module (ECM) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The ECM can fail due to various reasons, leading to a range of issues, including engine misfires, transmission problems, and other electrical malfunctions.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ECM and reprogram it to the vehicle.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur due to a variety of factors, including faulty modules, aftermarket accessories, or a failing alternator.
    * Solution: Diagnose the source of the drain and repair or replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause, but can range from $100 (for a new battery) to $1000+ for complex electrical repairs.

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the vehicle (e.g., oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors) can fail, leading to poor engine performance, check engine lights, and other issues.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor, including labor.
