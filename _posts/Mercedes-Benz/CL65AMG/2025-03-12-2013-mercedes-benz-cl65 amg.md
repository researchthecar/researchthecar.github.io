The 2013 Mercedes-Benz CL65 AMG is a high-performance luxury coupe known for its powerful V12 engine and opulent features. The CL-Class offered other engine options including a CL550 with a 4.6L twin-turbo V8 producing 429 hp and 516 lb-ft of torque, and a CL63 AMG with a 5.5L twin-turbo V8 producing 536 hp and 590 lb-ft of torque (or 563 hp/664 lb-ft with the Performance Package). However, the CL65 AMG boasts a hand-built 6.0L twin-turbo V12 engine generating 621 horsepower and a staggering 738 lb-ft of torque. This immense power delivers exhilarating acceleration. Owners often praise the car's luxurious interior, sophisticated technology, and comfortable ride for a high-performance vehicle. Criticisms often include the high cost of ownership, complex systems prone to failure, and relatively poor fuel economy. All CL-Class models use a 7-speed automatic transmission except for the CL65 AMG, which is equipped with a 5-speed automatic, the only transmission available for this car.
