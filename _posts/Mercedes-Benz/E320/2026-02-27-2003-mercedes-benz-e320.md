### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz E320 offers a compelling package of luxury and performance, but like many German luxury cars of this vintage, it can present specific repair challenges. The gasoline V6 and the diesel engine have known potential issues, particularly with intake manifold gaskets and glow plugs/turbochargers respectively. Transmission issues, notably with the conductor plate, are also a common concern. The advanced Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, while providing an excellent ride, can be a significant source of expensive repairs if it develops leaks. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the SAM module or instrument cluster, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, attention to climate control actuators and sunroof drains is advised. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the reliability of this E-Class.
