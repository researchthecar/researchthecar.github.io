### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz E320 is a capable luxury sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues that arise with age and mileage. The diesel engine (OM647) can be reliable but may face injector or glow plug problems. The gasoline V6 (M112) is generally robust but can suffer from oil cooler seal and intake manifold gasket leaks. Transmission issues, particularly with the 5-speed automatic's conductor plate, are a notable concern. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the SAM unit and window regulators, are also frequently reported. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, minor issues like sagging headliners and climate control actuator failures can occur. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining this vehicle's long-term reliability.
