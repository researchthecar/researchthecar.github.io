**Summary:**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz E320, while a comfortable and well-built vehicle, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most prevalent issues involve the electrical system (SAM modules, instrument cluster), air suspension (if equipped), transmission, and potential for rust. While some repairs, like the pilot bushing leak, are relatively inexpensive, others, like air suspension compressor failure or SAM replacement, can be quite costly. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchase. The potential for higher repair costs, especially with the electrical and suspension systems, should be factored into the overall ownership cost.
