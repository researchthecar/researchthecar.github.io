**Summary**

The 2008 Mercedes-Benz E320 Bluetec, while offering a luxurious and efficient driving experience, is prone to several issues common to its generation. The diesel engine, while reliable, can suffer from oil leaks, swirl motor failures, and DPF problems, leading to potentially costly repairs. Transmission issues related to the conductor plate and valve body are also prevalent. Airmatic suspension, if equipped, can add to the maintenance burden. Electrical problems stemming from the EIS, SAM modules, and door lock actuators can also be frustrating. While some issues may be relatively inexpensive to fix, others, particularly those involving the engine, transmission, or suspension, can result in significant repair bills. Pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance are crucial for mitigating these risks.
