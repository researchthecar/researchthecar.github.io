### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz E320 (W211) offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, especially with its efficient turbodiesel engine. While generally reliable, potential owners should be aware of specific common issues. The diesel engine can face problems with the intake manifold, EGR valve, and glow plugs. The transmission, particularly the 5-speed automatic, may experience issues with its control module or conductor plate. Suspension components, especially the AIRMATIC system, are prone to leaks and wear. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the SAM unit or window regulators, are also noted. Despite these potential concerns, many issues are repairable, and proactive maintenance can mitigate some risks. Overall, the E320 remains a desirable vehicle, but buyers should budget for potential repairs, especially on higher-mileage examples.
