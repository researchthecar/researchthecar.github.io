The 2013 Mercedes-Benz SLK55 AMG is a high-performance roadster known for its powerful engine and sporty handling. While the standard SLK models came with smaller, less powerful engines, the SLK55 AMG boasted a naturally aspirated 5.5-liter V8 engine producing 415 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. It came standard with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the SLK55 AMG for its exhilarating acceleration, responsive handling, and luxurious interior. Some common complaints include the firm ride (especially on rough roads), limited cargo space, and relatively high running costs.
