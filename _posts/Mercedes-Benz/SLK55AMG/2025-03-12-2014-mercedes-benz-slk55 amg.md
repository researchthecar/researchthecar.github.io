**Engine**

**5.5L M152 V8**
*   **Camshaft Adjuster/Magnet Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idle, decreased performance. The camshaft adjuster magnets can fail, causing the camshaft timing to be incorrect.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft adjuster magnet(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

*   **Valve Lifter Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or clicking noise from the engine, especially noticeable at idle or low speeds. This is often caused by worn or sticking hydraulic valve lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected valve lifters. In some cases, a more extensive repair may be needed if the camshaft is damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $4000+

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets, such as the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal.

**7G-TRONIC PLUS (722.9)**
*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse, or slipping between gears. These issues can be caused by valve body problems, conductor plate failure, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to determine the cause, followed by repair or replacement of the valve body, conductor plate, or other faulty components. A transmission fluid flush may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop. This can be caused by a failing torque converter.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, failure of the air compressor, or error messages on the dashboard.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per strut, $500-$1500+ for the air compressor.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for an extended period. This can be due to a faulty component not shutting off properly.
