The 2007 Mercedes-Benz SLK55 AMG is a high-performance roadster featuring a hand-built 5.5-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 355 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. It was available exclusively with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC). Owners often praise its exhilarating performance, distinctive exhaust note, and retractable hardtop, but some criticisms include the firm ride and dated interior. Common complaints revolve around maintenance costs associated with a high-performance vehicle and potential reliability issues related to its age.

**Engine**

**5.5L V8 (M113)**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Magnet) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the camshaft adjuster solenoids (magnets) can occur. This often presents as oil dripping down the front of the engine, potentially leading to misfires if oil contaminates the wiring harness.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking camshaft adjuster solenoid(s) and cleaning of any affected wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on how many solenoids need replacing and extent of wiring harness cleaning)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets are a common issue with age. The leak is usually visible on the sides of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Bolt Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant consumption without external leaks, possible overheating, and milky oil. This is a less common but serious issue caused by corrosion of the cylinder head bolts, leading to coolant entering the oil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head bolts (potentially requiring head gasket replacement as well).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC (722.9)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, getting stuck in gear, or complete transmission failure can result from a faulty conductor plate within the transmission. This plate houses the speed sensors and valve body control unit.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or slipping between gears can indicate problems within the valve body, which controls hydraulic pressure to the transmission's clutches.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) System Leaks and Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC system is prone to leaks from hoses, struts, and the pump. This results in a loss of ride height, warning messages, and a stiff or bouncy ride. The pump itself can also fail.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of leaking components (hoses, struts, pump). System flush and fluid replacement is recommended after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per component (leaks are common and cumulative)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps, can indicate worn ball joints.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixelation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the instrument cluster display may fade or disappear, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM module controls various electrical functions. Failure can cause a range of issues, including lighting problems, wiper malfunctions, and starting problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty SAM module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the specific SAM and programming required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Retractable Hardtop Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The retractable hardtop mechanism can experience problems with its hydraulics, sensors, or latches, leading to the top failing to open or close properly. This may be accompanied by warning messages.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the specific issue (hydraulic leaks, sensor replacement, latch adjustment).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the complexity of the problem)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may stop working due to a broken heating element or a faulty control module.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per seat
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SRS (Airbag) Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SRS light may illuminate due to a faulty seat occupancy sensor, clock spring issue, or other airbag system problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the specific SRS fault.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz SLK55 AMG, while offering a thrilling driving experience, is prone to various issues primarily due to its age and the complexity of its systems. Engine issues like oil leaks and head bolt corrosion can be costly to address. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can suffer from conductor plate and valve body problems. The ABC suspension system is a known source of expensive repairs. Electrical problems, particularly with the instrument cluster and SAM modules, are also common. Retractable hardtop malfunctions can also be costly. Overall, potential buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance costs and seek a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing or potential problems.
