The 2005 Mercedes-Benz SLK55 AMG is a high-performance roadster featuring a hand-built 5.4L naturally aspirated V8 engine, producing 355 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available in the SLK range for that year included a 3.5L V6, and a 1.8L Supercharged I4. The SLK55 AMG came exclusively with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). Owners often praise the car for its impressive acceleration, throaty exhaust note, and relatively compact size, making it fun to drive. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated interior and potential for costly repairs due to its performance-oriented nature.

**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz SLK55 AMG, while a desirable performance roadster, can be prone to several issues. The most prevalent and potentially costly problems revolve around the engine (valve cover gasket leaks, camshaft solenoid failure) and the 7G-Tronic transmission (valve body issues). Suspension problems, particularly with the optional air suspension or ABC system, can also lead to significant repair bills. Electrical issues related to SAM modules can also be frustrating. Owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with these issues when considering purchasing or maintaining this vehicle. While the smaller issues are generally cheap, the larger repairs can be quite costly.
