### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE550 is a capable luxury SUV with a generally good reliability record for its class. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the optional AIRMATIC air suspension system, which can be costly to repair if issues arise. The powerful twin-turbo V8 engine and the 7-speed automatic transmission are robust but can experience issues like turbocharger problems or transmission shudder, particularly with higher mileage. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs associated with premium European vehicles, especially if the AIRMATIC suspension is equipped. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for long-term reliability.
