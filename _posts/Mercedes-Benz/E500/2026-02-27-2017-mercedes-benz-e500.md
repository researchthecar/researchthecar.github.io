### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz E500 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but like many high-end vehicles, it is not immune to potential technical issues. Owners should be aware of possible problems with the biturbo engines, particularly concerning wastegate actuators and oil leaks, and the advanced 9G-TRONIC transmission which can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. The optional AIR BODY CONTROL suspension is a notable area where leaks and compressor failures can occur, leading to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also documented. While the standard suspension and exterior/interior components are generally robust, proactive maintenance and awareness of these specific potential issues can help manage ownership costs and ensure a more reliable experience with this sophisticated luxury sedan.
