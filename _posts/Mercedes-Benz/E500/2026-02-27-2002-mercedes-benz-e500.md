### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz E500 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential owners should be aware of its specific reliability quirks. The V8 engine is robust, but ignition coils and oil cooler seals are common points of attention. The 722.6 transmission, while generally durable, can suffer from conductor plate issues. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, a hallmark of its premium feel, is a significant potential expense if it requires repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the SAM module and window regulators, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, minor issues like headlight hazing and HVAC component failures can arise. Regular, diligent maintenance by a qualified technician is crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring the longevity of this sophisticated vehicle.
