### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz E500 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of its specific reliability concerns. The potent 5.0L V8 engine can experience issues with ignition coils and oil cooler seals. The sophisticated 5-speed automatic transmission, particularly the conductor plate, is a known weak point. The optional Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, while providing an exceptional ride, is prone to costly hydraulic leaks and pump failures. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM module or instrument cluster, are also documented. Interior issues like sagging headliners and climate control actuators are less critical but add to potential repair costs. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and a budget for common repairs, the E500 can remain a rewarding vehicle.
