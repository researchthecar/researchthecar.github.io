### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz E500 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but like many high-end vehicles of its age, it can present specific repair challenges. The powerful 5.0L V8 engine is generally reliable, though leaks from oil cooler seals and intake manifold gaskets are known. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while robust, can suffer from conductor plate failures or fluid leaks. The optional Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a significant potential source of costly repairs due to hydraulic leaks and pump issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM and EIS modules, are also documented. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs compared to less complex vehicles, especially if the ABC suspension is equipped. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the E500's reliability.
