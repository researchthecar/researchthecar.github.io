Symptoms include excessive white smoke from the exhaust, loss of coolant, and rough engine idle. Repair involves replacing the cylinder head bolts and resurfacing the cylinder heads. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
- **Oil Cooler Line Leaks:** Oil cooler lines can develop leaks, causing low oil levels and potential engine damage. Symptoms include an illuminated oil pressure warning light, blue smoke from the exhaust, and oil spots under the vehicle. Repair involves replacing the oil cooler lines. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
- **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, leading to vacuum leaks and rough engine idle. Symptoms include a hissing sound from the engine, reduced engine power, and illuminated check engine light. Repair involves replacing the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**Transmission**

**Suspension**
- **Airmatic Suspension Failure:** The Airmatic suspension system can experience failures in the air compressor or struts, leading to uneven ride height, reduced handling, and illuminated suspension warning light. Repair involves replacing the affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+

**Electrical**
- **Multiplex Control Unit (MCU) Failure:** The MCU is responsible for communication between various electronic systems in the vehicle. Failure of the MCU can cause a variety of electrical issues, such as inoperative windows, locks, and lighting. Repair involves replacing the MCU. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
- **Battery Discharge:** The vehicle's battery can discharge prematurely due to a faulty alternator or parasitic drain. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle, dim headlights, and illuminated battery warning light. Repair involves testing and replacing the alternator or identifying and addressing the parasitic drain. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000

**Exterior**
- **Headlight Condensation:** Headlights may experience condensation inside the lenses due to poor sealing. This can affect visibility and cause the headlights to fail inspection. Repair involves replacing the headlight lenses or resealing the existing ones. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500

**Interior**
- **Sunroof Creaks and Groans:** The sunroof can develop creaking or groaning noises while opening or closing. This is typically caused by worn or misaligned tracks. Repair involves lubricating the tracks or replacing them if necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600

**Summary:**
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz E500 has several reported issues that can range in severity and cost. Engine and transmission issues can be particularly expensive to repair, while electrical and interior issues tend to be less severe. However, it's important to note that not all vehicles experience these problems, and owners may be satisfied with the vehicle's performance and features.
