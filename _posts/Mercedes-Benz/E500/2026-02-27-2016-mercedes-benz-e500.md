### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz E500 is a well-built luxury sedan with a generally strong reliability record. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the more complex systems, such as the AIRMATIC air suspension and the advanced powertrain components. Issues with timing chain tensioners and oil cooler leaks on the V8 engine, along with potential torque converter or valve body problems in the 7-speed transmission, are documented but not universal. Electrical gremlins in the infotainment and sensor systems can occur, and exterior moisture intrusion into headlights is also noted. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not indicative of widespread failure across all vehicles. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the E500's long-term reliability and enjoyment.
