### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz E500 is a reliable luxury vehicle, particularly the powertrain. The 4.7L twin-turbo V8 and 7-speed automatic transmission are generally robust, though occasional issues with turbo actuators, ignition coils, transmission control modules, and torque converters can occur. The AirMatic suspension system, while offering superior comfort, is more prone to issues like air spring leaks and compressor failures compared to the standard steel suspension. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and complexity. Overall, the E500 offers a strong reliability record for its class, with most potential issues being repairable, albeit sometimes costly, especially for the advanced suspension and powertrain components.
