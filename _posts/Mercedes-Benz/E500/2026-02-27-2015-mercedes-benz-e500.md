### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz E500 is a capable luxury sedan with a generally strong reliability record. The powerful 4.7L twin-turbo V8 engine is robust, though potential owners should be aware of possible timing chain tensioner wear and valve cover gasket leaks, which are not uncommon on higher-mileage examples. The 7G-TRONIC PLUS transmission is also generally reliable, but torque converter seal leaks and mechatronic unit issues can arise. The AirMatic suspension system, while offering superior comfort, is a known area for potential costly repairs due to strut leaks or compressor failure; the standard steel suspension is a more reliable alternative. Electrical issues are typically minor, such as headlight ballast failures. Overall, the E500 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but maintenance and potential repairs, especially for the air suspension, should be factored into ownership costs.
