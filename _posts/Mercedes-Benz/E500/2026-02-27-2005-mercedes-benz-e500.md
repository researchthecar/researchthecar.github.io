### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz E500 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but its advanced systems, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the 722.6 transmission, are known to be potential sources of significant repair costs if issues arise. Engine reliability is generally good for the M113 V8, though common leaks from oil cooler seals and intake manifold gaskets can occur. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM module, are also a possibility in vehicles of this age. While the interior and exterior are typically robust, prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for high repair bills associated with the more complex components. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a budget for potential maintenance are highly recommended.
