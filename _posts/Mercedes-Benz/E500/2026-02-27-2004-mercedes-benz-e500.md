### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz E500 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of its specific reliability concerns. The most significant potential expenses lie within the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, which can be costly to repair if leaks or pump failures occur. Engine and transmission issues, such as oil cooler seal leaks and conductor plate failures, are also documented and require attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the SAM module, can also arise. While the engine and transmission options are limited to the robust 5.0L V8 and 5-speed automatic, the complexity of the ABC suspension is a key factor in its long-term ownership costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for mitigating these potential issues.
