**Introduction:**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz E500 is a luxury sedan equipped with a powerful 5.0L V8 engine, producing 302 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. It comes with a standard seven-speed automatic transmission. The E500 is highly regarded for its spacious and comfortable interior, advanced technology, and performance. However, it has also been reported to have several common issues.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8**

* **Cam Position Sensor Failure:** The camshaft position sensor may fail, causing the engine to run poorly or not at all. Symptoms include rough idling, stalling, and difficulty starting. The solution is to replace the faulty sensor. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A leak in the intake manifold gasket can cause a loss of power, rough idling, and a ticking noise. The solution is to replace the gaskets. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $800+.
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to slip and damage the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, rough idling, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,000+.

**Transmission**

**Seven-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Shift Problems:** The transmission may experience shifting problems, such as slipping, jerking, or hesitation. The solution involves reprogramming the transmission or replacing faulty components. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,500+.
* **Torque Converter Lockup Failure:** The torque converter may fail to lock up properly, causing slipping and overheating. Symptoms include poor acceleration, increased fuel consumption, and overheating. The solution is to replace the torque converter. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+.

**Suspension**

* **Airmatic Suspension Compressor Failure:** The airmatic suspension compressor, which maintains the ride height, may fail. Symptoms include uneven ride height, a sagging suspension, and a compressor noise. The solution is to replace the compressor. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $1,500+.
* **Strut Mount Bearing Failure:** The strut mount bearings may wear out, causing a knocking or clunking noise when turning or driving over bumps. The solution is to replace the strut mount bearings. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $600+.

**Electrical**

* **Electrical Control Module Failure:** The electrical control module (ECM) may fail, causing a variety of electrical issues, such as a loss of power, lighting problems, or transmission problems. The solution is to replace the ECM. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **SAM Control Module Failure:** The Signal Acquisition Module (SAM) control module may fail, causing a variety of electrical issues, such as a loss of power, lighting problems, or sunroof problems. The solution is to replace the SAM control module. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+.

**Exterior**

* **Trunk Lid Release Failure:** The trunk lid release may fail, making it difficult or impossible to open the trunk. The solution is to replace the faulty latch or solenoid. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400+.
* **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch may fail, causing the headlights to not turn on or to stay on. The solution is to replace the headlight switch. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200+.

**Interior**

* **Cigarette Lighter Socket Failure:** The cigarette lighter socket may fail to work, preventing the use of accessories or charging devices. The solution is to replace the faulty socket. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200+.
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may malfunction, causing the temperature or airflow to not work properly. The solution involves diagnosing and repairing the faulty component, such as the blower motor or temperature sensor. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $800+.

**Summary:**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz E500 is a premium sedan with known issues in various categories. The engine is prone to cam position sensor failure and intake manifold gasket leaks. The transmission may experience shifting problems and torque converter lockup failure. The suspension can suffer from airmatic suspension compressor failure and strut mount bearing failure. Electrical problems include ECM and SAM control module failure. Exterior issues include trunk lid release failure and headlight switch failure. Additionally, interior issues such as cigarette lighter socket failure and climate control malfunction have been reported. The severity and cost of repairs for these issues can vary significantly, but overall, the E500 has potential for expensive maintenance and repairs.
