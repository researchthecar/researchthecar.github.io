### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its advanced systems, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the 5-speed automatic transmission, are known to be potential sources of significant repair costs. Engine-related issues, while less frequent, can also be costly to address. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the SAM unit, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and complexity. Prospective buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair expenses, and a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a specialist is highly recommended to identify any existing or potential problems.
