**Engine**

**5.4L Supercharged V8 (M113K)**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump circulates coolant through the supercharger's intercooler, which cools the intake air charge. If the pump fails, the engine can experience a loss of power, especially during hot weather or sustained high-speed driving. Overheating may also occur in extreme cases.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger engages and disengages via a clutch. Over time, this clutch can wear out or fail, resulting in a noticeable loss of power and a potential rattling noise from the supercharger area.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger clutch or, in some cases, the entire supercharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Crankshaft Position Sensor provides data to the ECU regarding the engine. When this fails, it may cause the vehicle to stall out, or have trouble starting. The car may also start and then immediately die.
    *   Solution: Replace the Crankshaft Position Sensor
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) System Leaks and Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC system is known for its complexity and potential for issues. Common problems include hydraulic leaks from the struts, pump failure, and valve block malfunctions. Symptoms include a sagging suspension, uneven ride height, warning lights, and a harsh or bouncy ride.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace leaking components, rebuild or replace the ABC pump, and/or replace faulty valve blocks. Flushing the system and replacing the filter is also crucial.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABC Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC system utilizes hydraulic struts at each corner of the vehicle, which are prone to leaking over time. Symptoms include the vehicle sagging, especially overnight, and a noticeable degradation in ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ABC strut. It's often recommended to replace struts in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per strut (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The LCD screens in the instrument cluster can suffer from pixel loss, making it difficult to read information such as the odometer, trip computer, and temperature.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. Some repair services specialize in fixing the LCD screens.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG offers a thrilling driving experience but comes with a higher risk of potentially expensive repairs.
