The 2006 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG is a performance coupe that blended luxury with impressive power. The primary engine option was a 5.4L Supercharged V8, producing 493 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. A notable aspect was its Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, designed to provide both comfort and handling. Owners generally appreciated the car's potent engine, luxurious interior, and distinctive styling. Common complaints often centered around the high cost of maintenance and repairs, particularly regarding the complex ABC suspension.

**Engine**

**5.4L Supercharged V8**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump, responsible for cooling the air entering the engine, can fail. Symptoms include reduced engine performance, particularly during hot weather or sustained periods of acceleration, and potentially triggering a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve cover gaskets can degrade over time, leading to oil leaks. This can be identified by visible oil residue around the valve covers, a burning oil smell, or a drop in oil level.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger itself can develop issues over time. These can range from failing bearings, reduced boost output, to the supercharger clutch failing. Symptoms may include unusual noises, reduced performance, or a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the supercharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate inside the transmission can fail, leading to erratic shifting, limp mode, or complete transmission failure. This is a known issue for this transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body controls the flow of hydraulic fluid within the transmission. Over time, it can wear or become clogged, resulting in harsh shifting, slipping, or failure to shift properly.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Active Body Control (ABC) System Leaks and Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC system is known for being problematic. Hydraulic lines, accumulators (spheres), and the pump can develop leaks or fail entirely. Symptoms include the car sitting low, uneven ride height, warning messages on the dashboard, and a stiff or bouncy ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty components (lines, accumulators, pump). A complete overhaul may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the component and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABC Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC struts combine damping and hydraulic functions. They can leak or fail internally. This results in uneven ride height, bouncy ride, and error messages on the instrument panel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ per strut.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EIS can fail, preventing the car from starting. This is a common Mercedes-Benz issue.
    *   Solution: Replace the EIS and potentially reprogram the keys.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: These cars have a lot of electrical components and can experience parasitic battery drain. This can lead to a dead battery if the car sits for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the drain. This may involve testing various modules and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Specific Geographic Areas)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Although generally well-built, some CL55 AMGs, especially those in areas with harsh winters and road salt, may exhibit rust, particularly around the wheel arches, door bottoms, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on severity.

**Summary**

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG offers exhilarating performance and luxurious features. However, potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, especially those related to the ABC suspension, transmission, and electrical systems. Repairs can be costly, so a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended. The ABC system is by far the biggest concern in terms of cost and frequency. Failing conductor plates in the transmission are also a significant concern. Overall, while the car is desirable, the potential for high maintenance costs should be factored into the ownership decision.
