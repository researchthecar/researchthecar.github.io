### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious coupe, but its advanced technology and performance focus mean potential owners should be prepared for maintenance and repair costs. The V8 engine is generally robust, but the supercharger and cooling systems can require attention. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while durable, can suffer from electronic control module and conductor plate issues. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a significant source of potential expense due to leaks and pump failures. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM unit or instrument cluster, are also common. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, specific components like the headliner can degrade over time. Overall, the CL55 AMG offers a thrilling driving experience, but its reliability is a mixed bag, heavily dependent on prior maintenance and the willingness to address complex system repairs.
