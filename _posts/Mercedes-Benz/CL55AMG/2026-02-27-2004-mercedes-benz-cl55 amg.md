### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG is a formidable performance coupe with a powerful engine and luxurious appointments. However, its advanced systems, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the supercharged V8 powertrain, are known to be sources of significant repair costs if issues arise. Common problems include hydraulic leaks and pump failures in the ABC system, and potential issues with the supercharger belt, coolant, and oil seals on the engine. The 5-speed automatic transmission can also experience issues with its control module or conductor plate. While the electrical, exterior, and interior components are generally reliable, owners should be prepared for the potential for high maintenance and repair bills, especially concerning the complex suspension and powertrain. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these risks.
