### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mercedes-Benz CL55 AMG is a capable performance coupe, but its advanced technology, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and complex electrical systems, can be sources of significant repair costs. The V8 engine itself is generally robust, but transmission issues, such as TCM or solenoid problems, are not uncommon. Electrical gremlins, including window regulators and headlight ballasts, are also frequently reported. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, age-related issues like headliner sagging can occur. Prospective buyers should budget for potential maintenance and repairs, especially concerning the ABC system and electronics, as these are the most common and costly areas of concern.
