The 2009 Mercedes-Benz GL500 (also known as the GL550 in some markets) is a full-size luxury SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and robust performance. The GL-Class offers a blend of luxury and capability, making it a popular choice for families and those who need to tow. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues reported by owners. The GL500/GL550 specifically came with a 5.5L V8 engine producing around 382 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options in the GL-Class lineup included a 3.0L V6 diesel (GL320/GL350 CDI) and a smaller 4.6L V8 gasoline engine (GL450 in some markets). All engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). Common owner praises include a smooth ride, spaciousness, and powerful engine. Common dislikes revolve around fuel economy, repair costs, and some electrical gremlins.
