The 2010 Mercedes-Benz GL500, also known as the GL550 in some markets, is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. While not officially named the GL500 in the North American market, this model is commonly referred to as such due to its engine designation. In North America, the closest equivalent is the GL550 which is equipped with a 5.5L V8 engine producing around 382 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the GL-Class in 2010 include the GL350 BlueTEC (diesel V6) and the GL450 (4.6L V8). All models typically came with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GL500/GL550 for its luxurious features, smooth ride, and ample cargo space. Common complaints include high maintenance costs, complicated electronics, and relatively poor fuel economy.
