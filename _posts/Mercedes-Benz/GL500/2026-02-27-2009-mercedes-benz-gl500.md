### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz GL500 is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 5.5L V8 engine can experience issues with the intake manifold runner flaps and timing chain wear, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-Tronic transmission is also prone to valve body and torque converter problems. The optional AirMatic suspension, while providing a comfortable ride, is a common source of leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly CAN bus communication errors and headlight module failures, can also arise. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, infotainment system glitches are not uncommon. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these known weak points are crucial for maintaining the GL500's reliability and avoiding significant repair bills.
