### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz GL500 offers a luxurious and powerful ownership experience, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The powertrain, particularly the 4.7L V8 engine and 7-speed transmission, can experience wear-related problems like timing chain issues and torque converter faults, which can be costly to repair. The AIRMATIC air suspension is another area prone to expensive failures, such as air spring leaks and compressor issues. Electrical components, especially the COMAND infotainment system and various sensors, may also develop glitches or malfunctions over time. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, these specific technical concerns represent the most significant reliability risks for this model year.
