The 2012 Mercedes-Benz GL500, also known as the GL550 in some markets, is a full-size luxury SUV offering a blend of comfort, performance, and sophistication. While the GL500 typically came equipped with a 4.7-liter V8 engine producing around 429 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, other engine options for the 2012 GL-Class included a 3.0-liter V6 (GL350 BlueTEC diesel) and a 3.5-liter V6 (GL350). All engines were typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC). Owners often praise the GL500 for its spacious cabin, smooth ride, and powerful engine. Some common dislikes include its relatively high running costs and the complexity of its electronic systems.

Engine problems, particularly related to camshaft adjusters and oil leaks in the V8 and DPF issues in the diesel, can be expensive to address. Transmission issues, especially with the valve body, are also common. The Airmatic suspension is a known weak point, and electrical glitches can add to the ownership costs. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in the potential for higher repair costs when considering this vehicle. Addressing issues early can help prevent them from escalating into more significant and expensive problems.
