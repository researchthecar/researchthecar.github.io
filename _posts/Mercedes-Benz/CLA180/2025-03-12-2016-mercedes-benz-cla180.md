The 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA180 is a compact luxury coupe known for its stylish design and relatively accessible price point within the Mercedes-Benz lineup. The CLA180 is powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 122 horsepower and 200 Nm (148 lb-ft) of torque. Other engine options available for the 2016 CLA range include the CLA200 (1.6L turbo), CLA250 (2.0L turbo), and the high-performance CLA45 AMG (2.0L turbo).
