The 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA180 is a compact four-door coupe known for its stylish design and relatively affordable entry point into the Mercedes-Benz brand. While the CLA180 specifically features a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing around 122 horsepower and 200 Nm of torque, other engine options available for the 2017 CLA range in different markets include more powerful gasoline engines such as the CLA200, CLA250 and AMG CLA45, as well as diesel options like the CLA200d and CLA220d. Transmission options generally include a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (7G-DCT), depending on the engine and market. Owners often praise the CLA's sleek aesthetics and comfortable interior, but some criticisms include a firm ride and limited rear headroom.
