The 2003 Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG is a high-performance variant of the W211 E-Class, renowned for its potent supercharged V8 engine and luxurious features. It's celebrated for its impressive acceleration, comfortable ride, and distinctive AMG styling. However, it can suffer from age-related issues and maintenance costs associated with high-performance vehicles. The E-Class was also available with various other engines, including naturally aspirated V6 and V8 options, as well as diesel engines. The E55 AMG specifically came with a 5.4L Supercharged V8 producing 469 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Dislikes typically revolve around the potential for expensive repairs and maintenance due to the complexity of the vehicle's systems and the cost of AMG-specific parts.

**5.4L Supercharged V8 (M113K)**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, overheating, diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to intake air temperature or supercharger performance. The intercooler pump circulates coolant to cool the air entering the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, or a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks onto the exhaust manifolds, causing a burning smell. Visible oil accumulation around the valve covers.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of supercharger boost, reduced engine power, unusual noises from the supercharger area.

**Summary**

The 2003 Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that can arise with age and high mileage. Problems with the airmatic suspension, transmission conductor plate, intercooler pump, and electrical systems are among the most frequently reported. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate to significant, and the cost of repairs can be substantial, especially given the specialized nature of AMG components. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify potential problems and negotiate accordingly.
