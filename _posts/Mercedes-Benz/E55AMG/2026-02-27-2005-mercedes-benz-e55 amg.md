### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG offers exhilarating performance but comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly in its advanced systems. The supercharged V8 engine, while powerful, can experience issues with its supercharger clutch and intercooler system. The sophisticated 5-speed automatic transmission may develop problems with the conductor plate or torque converter. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a common source of expensive hydraulic leaks and pump failures. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the instrument cluster and seat modules, are also reported. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, specific components like headlight ballasts and sunroof mechanisms can require attention. Prospective buyers should budget for potential repairs, especially for the ABC system and transmission, as these can be costly.
