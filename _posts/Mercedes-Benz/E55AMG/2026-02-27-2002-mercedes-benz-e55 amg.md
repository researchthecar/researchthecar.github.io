### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its advanced systems, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the supercharged V8 engine, can be sources of significant repair costs if issues arise. Common problems include hydraulic leaks and pump failures in the ABC system, and potential issues with the supercharger belt and intercooler system for the engine. Transmission issues, such as TCM or conductor plate problems, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the SAM module, can be complex to diagnose. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, specific components like seat heaters and climate control actuators can fail. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair costs, especially for the specialized performance and suspension systems.
