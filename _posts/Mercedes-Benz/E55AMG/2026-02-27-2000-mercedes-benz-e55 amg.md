### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG (W210) is a powerful and luxurious sedan, but its age means potential for specific issues beyond routine maintenance. The M113 V8 engine is generally robust, but ignition coils, oil cooler seals, and MAF sensors can require attention. The 5G-Tronic transmission, while strong, is prone to conductor plate and TCM failures. Suspension components, especially if equipped with the optional ABC system, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and headlight ballasts are common. Exterior rust, particularly on wheel arches, and interior issues like sagging headliners are also noted. Despite these potential concerns, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known issues, the E55 AMG can remain a rewarding and reliable performance car.
