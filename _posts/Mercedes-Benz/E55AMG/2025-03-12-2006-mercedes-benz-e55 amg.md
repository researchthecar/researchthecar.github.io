The 2006 Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG is a performance sedan that blends luxury with impressive power. This model year features a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 engine, producing 469 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the E55 AMG for its exhilarating acceleration and comfortable ride, while common complaints revolve around maintenance costs associated with its high-performance components and age-related issues.

**Engine**

**5.4L Supercharged V8 (M113K)**
*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud whining or grinding noise from the supercharger, loss of boost, and reduced acceleration. This can be caused by worn or damaged clutch components.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, reduced engine performance, and potentially triggering a check engine light. The intercooler pump circulates coolant through the intercooler to cool the intake air charge. Failure can result in heat soak and significant power loss.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve covers, burning oil smell, and potentially oil dripping onto exhaust components.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**
*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission slipping, limp mode (restricted to a single gear), and diagnostic trouble codes related to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially during acceleration, slipping between gears, and potentially stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, failure to maintain ride height, compressor running constantly, and warning lights on the dashboard. This is a common issue with the air suspension system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is required to determine the specific component failure. This can include air struts, air compressor, valve block, or air lines. Replacement of the faulty components is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per strut; $500 - $1000+ for compressor replacement.
*   **ABC (Active Body Control) Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking fluid, vehicle leaning to one side, ABC warning light, rough ride.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is required to determine the specific component failure. This can include ABC Struts, hydraulic pump, or pulsation damper. Replacement of the faulty components is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per strut; $1500 - $3000+ for pump replacement.

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixelation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels missing or fading on the instrument cluster display, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Multiple electrical malfunctions, such as lighting issues, window problems, or central locking failure. The SAM controls various electrical functions in the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the affected SAM module (front or rear) and replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door not locking or unlocking properly, either manually or with the key fob.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per door.

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings.
    *   Solution: Remove headlight assembly, dry out the moisture, and reseal or replace the headlight housing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on repair vs. replacement.

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof failing to open or close properly, making unusual noises, or leaking water.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the issue (broken tracks, motor failure, etc.) and repair or replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
*   **Center Console Buttons/Switches Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Buttons or switches on the center console (e.g., for seat heating, climate control) failing to respond or sticking.
