### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Andare offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly with the V8 engines. The most common concerns tend to be related to the intake manifold runner flap and balance shaft wear on the M272 V6 engine, and potential solenoid or torque converter issues with the 7G-TRONIC transmission. Optional air suspension systems can also present repair costs if leaks or compressor failures occur. Electrical gremlins, particularly CAN bus communication errors, are not uncommon in vehicles of this era and complexity. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the Andare can remain a dependable luxury vehicle.
