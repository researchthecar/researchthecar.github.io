The 2007 Mercedes-Benz Andare is not a recognized model. It is possible there's a misunderstanding of the name or that it's a limited regional model. If you meant the Sprinter Van, then the following is an accurate representation of its issues. The 2007 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van was offered with several engine and transmission options. The 2.1L diesel engine and the 3.0L diesel engine were popular choices.

Owners generally appreciate the Sprinter's spacious cargo area and versatility, but common complaints include reliability issues and higher maintenance costs compared to other vans.
