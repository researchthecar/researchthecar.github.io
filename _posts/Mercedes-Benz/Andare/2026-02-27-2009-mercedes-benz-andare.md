### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz Andare offers a generally reliable ownership experience, particularly in its core mechanical components. While diesel engines, especially the 3.0L CDI, can encounter issues like DPF problems and injector faults, these are often manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. The automatic transmissions are robust, though older units might require attention to the torque converter or valve body. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the SAM unit, are a known concern for Mercedes-Benz vehicles of this era. Suspension, especially air suspension systems, can develop leaks over time. Overall, the Andare is a well-built vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections.
