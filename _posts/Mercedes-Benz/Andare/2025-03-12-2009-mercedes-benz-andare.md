The 2009 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 was the first model year for the GLK-Class, a compact luxury SUV. It was offered with a 3.5L V6 engine (268 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque) and a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). Owners generally appreciate the GLK350's refined ride, solid build quality, and distinctive styling. However, some common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy for its class and a somewhat cramped rear seat.

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz GLK350, while generally a reliable vehicle for its time, has common issues related to its engine (oil leaks), transmission (rough shifting), suspension (control arm bushings), and electrical systems (EIS, power tailgate). While some issues, like the camshaft adjuster solenoid leaks, are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, like transmission problems, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
