### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz Andare, while offering a premium experience, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for vehicles of its age and luxury segment. Diesel engines, particularly the CDI variants, can face issues with emissions systems like the DPF and EGR, as well as turbocharger problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the 7G-TRONIC, may require attention for solenoid issues. The air suspension system is a notable area for potential costly repairs due to leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, often related to CAN bus communication, can also manifest. Petrol engines and standard coil spring suspension appear to be more robust. Owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs related to these specific components, especially if opting for diesel or air-suspended models.
