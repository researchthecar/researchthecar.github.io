**Summary**

The 2010 Mercedes-Benz GLK350, while generally reliable for its age, can suffer from a range of issues. Engine problems such as camshaft adjuster solenoid and oil leaks are common. Transmission issues with the 7G-Tronic can be costly. Suspension components like control arm bushings and air springs (if equipped) are also prone to wear. Electrical problems with the EIS and SAM modules can be frustrating. The cost of repairs can vary, but some issues, particularly those involving the transmission and electrical systems, can be relatively expensive. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
