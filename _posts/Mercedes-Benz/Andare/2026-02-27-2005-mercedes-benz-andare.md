### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Andare, while offering a comfortable and practical experience, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for a vehicle of its age and luxury segment. The diesel engines, particularly the 2.2L CDI, can experience issues with glow plugs and turbochargers. The automatic transmission, especially the 5-speed 722.6, may require attention to its control module or torque converter. Suspension components like air springs (if equipped) and bushings are also noted areas. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, can also arise. The manual transmission and exterior/interior components generally fare better with fewer reported widespread issues. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the Andare's reliability.
