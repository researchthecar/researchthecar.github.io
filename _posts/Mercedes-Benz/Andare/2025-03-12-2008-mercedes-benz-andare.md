The 2008 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, including the "Andare" trim (likely referring to models with specific packages or market designations), offers a blend of luxury and performance. Engine options commonly include the C200 Kompressor, C230, C280, C300, and C350, with both gasoline and diesel variants available depending on the market. Horsepower figures range significantly, from approximately 156 hp in the C200 to over 268 hp in the C350. Torque figures are similarly varied. Owners generally appreciate the C-Class for its comfortable ride, refined interior, and Mercedes-Benz brand prestige. Common dislikes often revolve around maintenance costs, potential electrical issues, and sometimes, a perceived lack of sporty driving feel compared to some competitors.

**Summary**

The 2008 Mercedes-Benz C-Class can be a good car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. The balance shaft issue in the M272 engine can be very expensive to repair, making a pre-purchase inspection crucial. The 7G-Tronic transmission has known problems as well. While some issues, like control arm bushings, are relatively inexpensive, others, such as EIS or SAM module failures, can be costly. Overall, the severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, but awareness of these potential problems can help buyers make an informed decision and budget accordingly.
