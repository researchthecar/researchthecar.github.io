# 2005 Mercedes-Benz A190

### Overview
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz A190, part of the W168 generation, was a compact hatchback known for its innovative 'sandwich' floor design, which allowed for a spacious interior and flexible seating arrangements within a small footprint. While generally considered a competent vehicle for its class, like any car of this age, it has specific areas that have seen more reported issues than others. This analysis focuses on common mechanical and electrical points of concern that owners have reported, excluding routine maintenance and standard wear and tear. Understanding these potential issues can help prospective buyers and current owners manage expectations and maintenance costs.

## Engine

### 1.9L Inline-4 (M166)
**Ignition Coil Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Misfires, rough idling, check engine light, reduced engine power.
- **Solution:** Replacement of faulty ignition coil(s).
- **Cost:** $150 - $300 per coil

**Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket)**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil around the top of the engine, burning oil smell, potential for oil to drip onto exhaust manifold.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the valve cover gasket.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Transmission

### Autotronic (Continuously Variable Transmission - CVT)
**Transmission Slipping/Hesitation**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, slipping between 'gears' (simulated), jerky acceleration.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, potential for internal component repair or replacement.
- **Cost:** $400 - $1500 (fluid/filter) up to $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)

**Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Malfunctions**
- **Symptoms:** Erratic shifting behavior, 'limp mode' engagement, transmission warning lights.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and reprogramming or replacement of the transmission ECU.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1200


## Suspension

### Standard McPherson Strut Front / Torsion Beam Rear
**Worn Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700 per axle

**Rear Shock Absorber Leaks/Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, reduced damping, visible fluid leaks from shock absorbers.
- **Solution:** Replacement of rear shock absorbers.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500 per pair


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Malfunctioning power windows, interior lights, central locking issues, dashboard warning lights appearing randomly.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $600 - $1500


### ABS Sensor Failure
**ABS/ESP Warning Lights**
- **Symptoms:** Illuminated ABS and/or ESP warning lights on the dashboard, loss of ABS and traction control functionality.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the faulty ABS wheel speed sensor.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400 per sensor


## Exterior

### Body Panels and Trim
**Rust (Wheel Arches, Sills)**
- **Symptoms:** Visible corrosion, bubbling paintwork, particularly in areas prone to moisture accumulation.
- **Solution:** Rust treatment and repair, repainting.
- **Cost:** $400 - $1000+ depending on severity


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** HVAC fan only works on the highest setting, or not at all.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
- **Cost:** $100 - $250


### Seat Adjustment Mechanism
**Stiff or Jammed Seat Rails**
- **Symptoms:** Difficulty sliding or reclining front seats.
- **Solution:** Cleaning and lubrication of seat rails, or replacement if severely damaged.
- **Cost:** $50 - $200

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz A190, while offering practical advantages, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and German engineering. The engine, particularly the 1.9L unit, can suffer from ignition coil failures and oil leaks from the valve cover gasket. The Autotronic CVT transmission is a known weak point, with potential for slipping, hesitation, and ECU issues requiring significant investment to repair. Suspension components like control arm bushings and rear shocks are also prone to wear. Electrically, the Body Control Module can cause a range of frustrating, intermittent problems, and ABS sensors are a common failure point. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain areas, and interior climate control (blower motor resistor) and seat mechanisms may require attention. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the transmission and electrical systems.
