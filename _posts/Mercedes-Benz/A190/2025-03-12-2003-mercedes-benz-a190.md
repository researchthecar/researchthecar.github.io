The 2003 Mercedes-Benz A190 is a compact MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) known for its innovative design and practicality. While the A190 specifically features a 1.9-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 125 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque, the A-Class range also offered other engine options, including smaller gasoline and diesel engines. It was available with either a 5-speed manual or a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). Owners appreciate the A-Class for its spacious interior relative to its small footprint and its comfortable ride. Common criticisms include its quirky styling and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2003 Mercedes-Benz A190, while offering practicality and innovative design, can present owners with a range of issues. The most significant concerns relate to the CVT transmission, which can be expensive to repair or replace. Engine oil leaks and electrical problems are also relatively common. Suspension issues such as broken coil springs and worn bushings can affect ride quality and handling. Rust can also be a concern, depending on the vehicle's history and location. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect any used A190, paying particular attention to the transmission's condition and any signs of rust. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and location, but owners should be prepared for potentially costly repairs, especially related to the CVT transmission.
