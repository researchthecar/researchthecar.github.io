### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz A190 offers a unique blend of practicality and Mercedes-Benz engineering. While it avoids major widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of potential issues such as oil and coolant leaks from the 1.9L engine, and specific concerns with the Autotronic CVT transmission, which can manifest as jerking or hesitation. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and ABS sensors, are also noted. Exterior rust, especially on wheel arches and sills, can be a concern depending on climate and maintenance. Interior comfort can be affected by AC compressor issues or stiff seat mechanisms. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to ensuring the longevity and reliability of the A190.
