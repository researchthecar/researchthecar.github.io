The 2004 Mercedes-Benz A190 is a subcompact car known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. The A190 featured a 1.9-liter inline-4 engine producing approximately 125 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the A-Class included smaller displacement gasoline and diesel engines. The A190 typically came with a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its compact size for city driving, its relatively spacious interior for its class, and its fuel economy. Common criticisms include its somewhat quirky styling, potential for higher maintenance costs associated with the Mercedes-Benz brand, and sometimes a less engaging driving experience compared to other vehicles.

**Engine**

**1.9L Inline-4 (M266)**

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, clunking noises during acceleration or deceleration, visibly worn or cracked engine mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the engine mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idling, stalling, decreased fuel economy, check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks around the engine, burning oil smell, low oil level. Common leak locations include the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and crankshaft seals.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ (depending on the location and complexity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially first or reverse, grinding noises during shifting, clutch pedal feels stiff or sticky.
    *   Solution: Possible causes include worn clutch components (clutch disc, pressure plate, throw-out bearing), a faulty clutch master or slave cylinder, or low transmission fluid. Diagnosis is needed to determine the exact cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the parts needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, erratic shifting behavior, transmission warning light illumination.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low or contaminated transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal transmission damage. A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor issues. More serious problems require transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3000+ (depending on the severity and whether repair or replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps, excessive bouncing, uneven tire wear, poor handling. Common culprits include worn ball joints, tie rod ends, control arm bushings, and shock absorbers/struts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components.
