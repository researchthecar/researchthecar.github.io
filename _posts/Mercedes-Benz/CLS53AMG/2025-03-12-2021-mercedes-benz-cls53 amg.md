The 2021 Mercedes-Benz CLS53 AMG is a performance-oriented four-door coupe that blends sleek styling with impressive power. It features a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbocharged engine with EQ Boost, producing 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. The engine is paired with an AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT 9-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and potent powertrain, some owners have reported experiencing specific issues. Other CLS models have different engines and transmissions, but the CLS53 AMG is unique in its powertrain configuration. Some common dislikes include the limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline and the complexity of the infotainment system.
