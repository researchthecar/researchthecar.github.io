The 2015 Mercedes-Benz GLA200 is a compact SUV that combines the practicality of a hatchback with the style and sophistication expected from the Mercedes-Benz brand. The GLA200 is equipped with a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing around 154 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available included the GLA250 with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4. Both were typically paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. People often praise the GLA for its fuel efficiency, stylish design, and comfortable ride. However, some criticisms include its relatively small cargo space and the sometimes-hesitant nature of the dual-clutch transmission.
