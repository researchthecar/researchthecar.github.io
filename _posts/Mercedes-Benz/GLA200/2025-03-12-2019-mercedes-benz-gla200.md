The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLA200 is a subcompact luxury SUV offering a blend of style, practicality, and Mercedes-Benz refinement. The GLA200 is typically equipped with a 1.3-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing around 154 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Other engine options available in some markets include the GLA 250 with a more powerful 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, and various AMG performance versions. What people often appreciate about the GLA is its nimble handling, upscale interior, and fuel efficiency. Downsides often mentioned include a relatively small rear seat and cargo area compared to some competitors, and potentially expensive maintenance costs associated with the Mercedes-Benz brand.
