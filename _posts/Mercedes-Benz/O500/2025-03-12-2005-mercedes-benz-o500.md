The 2005 Mercedes-Benz O500 is a popular bus chassis used worldwide for city and intercity transportation. It was offered with a range of diesel engines, including the OM457 series, and several transmission options, most commonly the ZF Ecomat automatic. Owners appreciate the chassis's robust construction, reliability, and comfortable ride. However, like any vehicle, it's prone to certain issues. Common complaints include electrical system problems, air suspension issues, and component wear related to heavy use and mileage.

**Engine**

**OM457 Diesel Engine**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are common around the water pump, cylinder head gasket, and radiator hoses. This can lead to overheating and engine damage. Symptoms include low coolant levels, visible leaks, and elevated engine temperatures.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking gaskets, hoses, or the water pump. Pressure test the cooling system to identify all leak points.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the component
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning fuel injectors can cause rough idling, poor fuel economy, lack of power, and excessive smoke.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injectors. It is recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure even fuel delivery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on if you replace all injectors or not.

**Transmission**

**ZF Ecomat Automatic Transmission**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, and difficulty engaging gears are common complaints. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service, including fluid and filter replacement. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the transmission may need a full overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+, depending on the severity and if an overhaul is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail due to wear and tear, causing a loss of power transfer and unusual noises. Symptoms include shuddering, stalling, and a lack of acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air leaks in the air suspension system cause the bus to sag on one side or fail to maintain ride height. Leaks often occur in the air bags, airlines, or fittings.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair the air leaks. Replace damaged air bags, airlines, or fittings. Test the system for leaks after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ride Height Sensor Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty ride height sensors can cause incorrect ride height adjustments, leading to a bumpy ride or damage to the suspension components.
    *   Solution: Replace the malfunctioning ride height sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the sensor and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the bus's age and exposure to harsh environments, wiring harnesses can become brittle and corroded, leading to electrical malfunctions. Symptoms include intermittent lights, malfunctioning sensors, and starting problems.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair damaged wiring harnesses. Replace corroded connectors and wires.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the extent of the damage.
