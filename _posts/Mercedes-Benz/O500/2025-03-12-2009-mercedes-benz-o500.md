The 2009 Mercedes-Benz O500 is a popular chassis used for buses and coaches worldwide, known for its robust construction and versatility. While not a passenger car, understanding its common issues is crucial for operators and maintenance personnel. The O500 chassis is typically fitted with Mercedes-Benz diesel engines, such as the OM457 series, offering various power outputs depending on the specific application, commonly ranging from 220 kW (299 hp) to 260 kW (354 hp). Torque figures often fall in the range of 1250 Nm to 1600 Nm. Users generally appreciate the chassis's reliability and fuel efficiency, but some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the electronic systems and the cost of replacement parts. Transmission options often include Mercedes-Benz's own automated manual transmissions or ZF automatic transmissions.
