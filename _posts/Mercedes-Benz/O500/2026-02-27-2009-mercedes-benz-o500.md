### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz O500 chassis demonstrates a generally strong reliability record, particularly in its core powertrain and structural components. However, common issues tend to emerge in areas such as the air suspension system (air spring leaks, compressor issues) and specific engine components like turbochargers and EGR systems, especially on higher-mileage units. Electrical gremlins, often related to wiring harnesses or alternators, can also require attention. Proactive maintenance, focusing on regular inspections of seals, hoses, and electrical connections, alongside timely attention to warning lights, is crucial for mitigating potential downtime and repair costs. While not immune to problems, the O500's robust engineering means most issues are repairable, though costs can escalate for major powertrain or electrical system repairs.
