The 2008 Mercedes-Benz O500 is a popular chassis used for buses and coaches. Engine options typically include a range of diesel engines, with the OM 457 LA being a common choice. The OM 457 LA is a 12.0-liter inline-6 turbo diesel engine, producing around 360 horsepower and 1180 lb-ft of torque, although output can vary depending on configuration. Transmission options include automatic and manual gearboxes from manufacturers like ZF and Voith. Owners often praise the O500 for its robust build quality, reliability, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include maintenance costs, availability of specific parts in certain regions, and potential issues related to the air suspension system.
