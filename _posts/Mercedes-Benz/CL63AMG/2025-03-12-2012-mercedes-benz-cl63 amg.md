The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CL63 AMG is a high-performance luxury coupe featuring a hand-built 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 536 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. An optional Performance Package increased output to 563 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque. The engine is mated to a seven-speed MCT (Multi-Clutch Transmission) automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the CL63 AMG for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and refined ride. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and potential issues with the air suspension system.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CL63 AMG offers exhilarating performance and luxurious features but comes with potential maintenance challenges. Common issues revolve around the engine (oil leaks, turbo failures), transmission (harsh shifting), suspension (Airmatic/ABC failures), and electrical systems. Repair costs can be significant, particularly for suspension and engine-related problems. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the car's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Mercedes-Benz mechanic to identify potential issues. While some problems may be relatively minor, others can lead to substantial repair bills, making it crucial to be aware of these potential pitfalls before purchasing.
