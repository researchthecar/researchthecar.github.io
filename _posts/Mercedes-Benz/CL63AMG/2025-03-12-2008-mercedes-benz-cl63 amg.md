Common complaints revolve around its high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and potential for expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (also referred to as camshaft bolts) can fail, shearing off in the camshaft adjuster. Symptoms include a ticking noise from the engine, rough running, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the original bolts with updated, stronger bolts. Mercedes-Benz released a technical service bulletin (TSB) addressing this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the severity of the damage and labor costs.

*   **Valve Lifter/Hydraulic Lash Adjuster Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially upon cold start. This can be caused by failing valve lifters or hydraulic lash adjusters in the M156 engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty valve lifters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on how many need replacing and labor.

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The M156 engine in the CL63 AMG can sometimes exhibit higher than average oil consumption.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a rebuild of the engine may be required, including replacing piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or slipping between gears. The valve body contains solenoids and valves that control the flow of transmission fluid, and these can wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. Sometimes, just replacing the conductor plate on the valve body solves the issue, however, it is typically recommended to replace the entire valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, or unusual noises from the transmission. The torque converter can fail due to wear and tear or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CL63 AMG uses an Airmatic air suspension system. Common issues include air leaks in the struts, compressor failure, or issues with the valve block. Symptoms include the car sitting low, uneven ride height, or failure to raise/lower.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty struts, compressor, or valve block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per strut, $800 - $1,500+ for the compressor, $500 - $1,000+ for the valve block.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven regularly. This can be caused by various electrical issues, including faulty modules or parasitic drains.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the battery drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.

*   **Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various issues can arise from faulty ECUs, including engine performance problems, transmission issues, or other system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
