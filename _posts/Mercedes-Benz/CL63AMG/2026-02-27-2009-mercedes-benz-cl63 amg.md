### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CL63 AMG is a powerful and luxurious coupe, but its high-performance nature and complex systems mean potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The M156 V8 engine is known for potential head bolt and camshaft wear issues, requiring significant investment to rectify. The sophisticated ABC suspension system, while providing excellent ride quality, is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM unit and Keyless Go system, can also arise. Transmission issues, though less common, can involve the torque converter or mechatronic unit. Despite these potential challenges, many owners find the performance and luxury justify the maintenance costs. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a budget for potential repairs are highly recommended.
