**Summary**

The 2018 Mercedes-Benz C250 is generally a reliable vehicle, but owners have reported several common issues. The most frequent problems revolve around the engine (high-pressure fuel pump, camshaft solenoids), transmission (rough shifting), and electrical system (COMAND system glitches, parking sensor malfunctions). Suspension issues (air suspension and control arm bushings) can also arise. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as replacing the high-pressure fuel pump, torque converter, or air suspension compressor, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering this vehicle.
