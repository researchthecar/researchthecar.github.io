The C250 is powered by a 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 201 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2011 C-Class include a 3.0-liter V6 in the C300 and a 3.5-liter V6 in the C350, as well as a high-performance 6.2-liter V8 in the C63 AMG. All engine options are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the C250's fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and upscale interior. Common dislikes include the somewhat firm suspension and occasional electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**1.8L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M271)**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and potential loss of power. The camshaft adjuster solenoid (also known as a variable valve timing solenoid) can fail, causing improper valve timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Extended cranking, difficulty starting, stalling, and a check engine light. The high-pressure fuel pump can fail, leading to insufficient fuel delivery to the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC 7-Speed Automatic (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, erratic shifting behavior, and a transmission malfunction warning light. The valve body, which controls the flow of hydraulic fluid within the transmission, can experience wear or failure of its components.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. Sometimes only the conductor plate needs replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during acceleration. Stalling, poor acceleration, and transmission slipping may also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Uneven tire wear and vague steering may also be present. The front lower control arm bushings tend to wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front lower control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Electronic Steering Lock (ESL) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Key will not turn in the ignition, car will not start, and an "ESL Malfunction" message may be displayed on the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reprogramming of the ESL module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EIS/EZS (Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Key is hard to turn, car won't start, intermittent no-start conditions, or the system fails to recognize the key.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EIS/EZS (Electronic Ignition Switch) module and potentially re-keying.

**Summary**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz C250 is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the transmission (valve body, torque converter), followed by engine issues such as camshaft adjuster solenoid and high-pressure fuel pump failures, and electronic problems such as electronic steering lock failure. Suspension issues, particularly worn control arm bushings, are also common. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the severity and complexity of the issue. Owners should be diligent about regular maintenance and address any warning signs promptly to minimize potential repair expenses.
