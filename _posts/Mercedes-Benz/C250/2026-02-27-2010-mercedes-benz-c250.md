### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz C250 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The turbocharged 1.8L engine can experience timing chain and turbocharger issues, while the 7-speed automatic transmission may develop problems with its control module or torque converter. Suspension components, particularly front control arm bushings, can wear prematurely. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM module or headlight ballasts, are also noted.
