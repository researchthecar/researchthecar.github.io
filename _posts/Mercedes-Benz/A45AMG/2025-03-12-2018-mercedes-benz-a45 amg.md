Common dislikes include a firm ride quality and some concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M133)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises from the engine, check engine light illumination, potential oil leaks. Premature turbo failure can occur, sometimes due to oil starvation or excessive heat.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit. Inspection of oil lines and cooling system to identify the root cause of the failure is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, check engine light. The HPFP is critical for direct injection, and failures can lead to fuel delivery issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant level, overheating, visible coolant leaks under the car. Often, the coolant leaks stem from the water pump or the thermostat housing.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair the source of the leak, typically by replacing the faulty component (water pump, thermostat housing, hoses).
