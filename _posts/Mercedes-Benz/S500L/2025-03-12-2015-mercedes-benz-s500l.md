**Engine**

**4.7L Twin-Turbo V8**
* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are observed around the valve cover gaskets and the oil filter housing. The leaks can range from minor seepage to more significant drips, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage. Burning oil smell may also be present.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets and/or the oil filter housing gasket. Ensure proper torque specifications are followed during reassembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, whistling noises from the engine bay, and potential check engine light illumination. May be caused by oil starvation or excessive wear on the turbocharger components.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger(s). Inspect oil lines and filters to ensure proper lubrication to the turbochargers.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $5000+ (depending on if one or both turbos need replacing)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (7G-Tronic)**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. Hesitation upon acceleration from a stop.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body replacement may be necessary. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid/filter) - $4000+ (rebuild/replace)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially under light acceleration. Potential stalling or difficulty engaging gears.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter. Inspect the transmission for any related damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Airmatic Suspension Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car may sit unevenly, or the suspension may not adjust properly, leading to a harsh ride. Warning lights on the dashboard may illuminate. Leaks may be audible from the air struts.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific component causing the failure (air struts, air compressor, valve block). Replace the faulty component(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ per strut (depending on location and if OEM or aftermarket parts are used), $800-$1500 for compressor.
