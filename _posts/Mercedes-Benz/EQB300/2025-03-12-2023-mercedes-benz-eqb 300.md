The 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQB 300 4MATIC is an all-electric SUV that offers a blend of luxury, practicality, and modern technology. The EQB 300 features a dual-motor setup producing 225 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque, providing all-wheel drive capability. There is another model available called the EQB 350 that makes 288 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the EQB for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and advanced safety features. However, some common dislikes include the range limitations compared to gasoline vehicles, the sometimes-complex infotainment system, and the higher price point compared to non-luxury EVs.

**Summary**

The 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQB 300, while lauded for its interior space and electric powertrain, exhibits several common issues. Electrical problems, including MBUX glitches, 12V battery drain, and charging port malfunctions, are prominent. Issues with the electric motor and premature battery degradation can lead to expensive repairs. Exterior sensor malfunctions and interior component failures (seat motors, sunroof) further contribute to potential ownership costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, making thorough pre-purchase inspections and awareness of warranty coverage crucial.
