The EQB 300 4MATIC features a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system producing 225 horsepower and 288 lb-ft of torque. While praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior (especially for a compact SUV), and available third-row seating, some owners have noted concerns regarding range limitations compared to competitors, software glitches, and occasional build quality issues.
