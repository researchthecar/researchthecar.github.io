The primary area showing minor reported issues is the infotainment system, which can experience occasional software glitches, typically resolvable with updates. Other categories such as Engine, Transmission, Suspension, Exterior, and Interior components have not shown widespread reliability concerns. As an electric vehicle, it benefits from fewer moving parts compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, contributing to its generally positive reliability outlook. Owners should stay updated on software, as is common with modern vehicles, but major mechanical or electrical failures are not prevalent in early data.
