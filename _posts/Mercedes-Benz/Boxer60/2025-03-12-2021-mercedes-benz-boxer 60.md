The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, often referred to as the "Boxer 60" in certain markets due to its GVWR classification, is a versatile commercial van known for its spacious cargo area and reputation for durability. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine producing around 188 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel engine, delivering approximately 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Sprinter's customization options, comfortable ride for a commercial vehicle, and overall build quality. However, some common complaints revolve around the cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as potential issues with the emissions systems on the diesel variants.
