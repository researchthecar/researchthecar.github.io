The 2009 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (also known as the Boxer 60 in some markets) is a popular cargo van known for its spacious interior, fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel engines), and comfortable ride. Common engine options include various diesel engines. A frequently seen engine is the 3.0L V6 diesel which produces approximately 154 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Sprinter's versatility and cargo capacity, but some dislike its size for city driving and potential maintenance costs associated with the diesel engines.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clogging of the DPF, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and the DPF warning light illuminating. Can be caused by short trips where the engine doesn't reach optimal temperature for regeneration.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF (either by driving at sustained high speeds or by a mechanic using a diagnostic tool), cleaning the DPF, or, in severe cases, replacing the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 for forced regeneration, $500 - $1500+ for DPF replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty EGR valve can cause rough idling, poor acceleration, and the engine management light to come on.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, black smoke from exhaust, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Automatic Transmission (Likely a 5-Speed)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter, often accompanied by a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ (depending on labor and if a transmission rebuild is also needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifting, delayed shifting, or failure to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and whether the entire valve body needs to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sits lower than normal, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potentially a harsher ride. Cracking or breakage of the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs (often done in pairs).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the quality of the replacement springs and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll, and leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the struts/shock absorbers (often done in pairs).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Glow Plug Issues (Diesel Only)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke upon startup, and the glow plug warning light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty glow plug(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as lights not working, sensors malfunctioning, or the engine stalling. Can be caused by chafing or corrosion.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the damaged wiring harness. This may involve replacing sections of the harness or repairing individual wires.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and the labor involved).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Roller Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, a grinding noise when operating the door, and the door potentially not latching properly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn or broken sliding door rollers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor stops working, resulting in no air blowing from the vents. Sometimes only works on certain settings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, or Boxer 60, can be a reliable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly those associated with the diesel engine and automatic transmission. DPF clogging, EGR valve failure, and fuel injector problems are common on the diesel engine and can be costly to repair. Torque converter and valve body issues can plague the automatic transmission as well. Suspension components like leaf springs and struts are also susceptible to wear and tear. While some electrical issues can arise, they're generally less frequent than the engine and transmission issues. The costs of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific problem and the shop performing the work. Overall, pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance are crucial for minimizing potential problems with this vehicle.
