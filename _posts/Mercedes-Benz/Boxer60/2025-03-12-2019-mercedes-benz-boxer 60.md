The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, also known as the "Boxer 60" in some markets, is a popular choice for commercial and recreational use, valued for its spacious cargo area, versatility, and Mercedes-Benz engineering. Engine options include a 2.0L 4 cylinder diesel (161 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L V6 diesel (188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter's fuel efficiency (for its class), comfortable ride, and available technology. However, some common complaints include the higher upfront cost compared to competitors, potential for expensive repairs, and occasional issues with the emissions system.
