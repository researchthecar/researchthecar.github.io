The 2018 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, also known as the Boxer 60 in some markets, is a popular choice for commercial use due to its versatility and spacious cargo area. Engine options include a 2.1L four-cylinder diesel engine producing around 161 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 diesel engine producing around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. The 2.1L diesel is often paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L V6 is typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter's high roof, allowing for stand-up cargo access, and its relatively comfortable ride compared to other vans. However, some common complaints include the relatively high price, potential for diesel-related issues, and the overall cost of maintenance.

**Engine**

**2.1L Four-Cylinder Diesel Engine**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, DPF clogging, reduced engine performance, and warning lights on the dashboard. This is often caused by short trips where the DPF doesn't get hot enough to regenerate fully.
    * Solution: Forced DPF regeneration by a mechanic, cleaning the DPF, or replacing the DPF. Changing driving habits to include longer trips can help prevent future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the severity and required repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, black smoke from the exhaust, and an illuminated check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6 Diesel Engine**

* **Oil Cooler Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks near the oil cooler, often accompanied by a burning oil smell and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the oil cooler and associated seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbocharger, loss of power, and potentially a check engine light.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic Transmission (paired with 2.1L Diesel)**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts between gears. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    * Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. In some cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission (paired with 3.0L Diesel)**

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at low speeds, especially when accelerating.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear end of the van sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded.  Possible squeaking noises and compromised ride quality.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Front Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, especially over bumps.  Excessive lean in corners.  Fluid leaking from the strut.
    * Solution: Replacing the front struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Glow Plug Failure (Diesel Engines)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult starting in cold weather, rough idling, and potentially a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty glow plug(s) and potentially the glow plug control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, ABS light, or other warning lights illuminated on the dashboard. Specific symptoms will depend on the sensor that has failed (e.g., MAF sensor, O2 sensor, wheel speed sensor).
    * Solution: Diagnosing the faulty sensor and replacing it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor, depending on the location and complexity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, sticking, or excessive noise.

**Summary**

The 2018 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer 60) can be a reliable work vehicle, but owners should be aware of some common issues. Diesel engine issues, particularly with the DPF, EGR valve, and oil cooler (V6), are potential concerns and can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues, rough shifting with the 7-speed and torque converter issues with the 5-speed, can also arise. Suspension problems, like leaf spring sagging, and electrical problems like glow plug failure are less severe but should still be considered. Overall, while the Sprinter offers many advantages, its potential maintenance costs can be high. Careful inspection and preventative maintenance are crucial to minimizing these issues.
