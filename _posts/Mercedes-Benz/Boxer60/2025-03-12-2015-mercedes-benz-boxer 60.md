The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (also known as a Boxer 60 in some markets) is a popular cargo and passenger van known for its versatility and fuel efficiency. In the United States and other markets, the Sprinter is available with several engine options, including a 2.1L turbocharged 4-cylinder diesel engine (OM651) producing around 161 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L V6 diesel engine (OM642) generating approximately 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission or a 7-speed automatic transmission depending on the specific model and market. Owners often appreciate the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and relatively good fuel economy for its class. Common dislikes include the higher initial purchase price compared to some competitors and potential for expensive repairs.

**Summary**

The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, while a capable and versatile van, can suffer from several common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the diesel particulate filter, EGR valve, oil cooler leaks, and turbocharger on the OM642 engine, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 7G-Tronic's valve body, are also a concern. Other common problems include suspension issues like rear leaf spring sagging, electrical problems with glow plugs and SAM units, and exterior issues like sliding door roller failure. Interior issues, such as HVAC blower motor failure, can also arise. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing a 2015 Sprinter. The severity of the issues ranges from relatively minor (glow plugs) to potentially very expensive (engine and transmission rebuilds/replacements). The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the location of the repair.
