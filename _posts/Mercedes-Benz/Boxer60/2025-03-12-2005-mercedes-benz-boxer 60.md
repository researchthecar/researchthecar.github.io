The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer 60 is a common rebadge) is a popular van known for its versatility and cargo capacity. Engine options included a 2.7L Inline-5 Diesel (OM647) producing around 154 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Inline-5 Diesel. The most common transmission option was a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Sprinter's spacious interior and utilitarian design, but some common complaints include reliability issues and higher maintenance costs compared to other vans.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-5 Diesel (OM647)**

*   **Black Death (Injector Seal Failure)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaking injectors cause carbon buildup around the base of the injectors. This often creates a characteristic "ticking" or "chuffing" sound and can lead to fuel inefficiency and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Remove the injectors, clean the injector bores, replace the copper injector seals (washers), and reinstall the injectors with new bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+, depending on the extent of the damage and whether the injectors can be salvaged.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, whistling noises from the turbo, and potential engine damage if the turbo fails catastrophically.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Check for oil leaks and ensure proper lubrication to the new turbo.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, check engine light illuminated (often with EGR-related codes), and increased emissions.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR valve. Cleaning the EGR valve may provide a temporary fix, but replacement is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at low speeds, delayed or harsh shifting, and potential transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, slipping between gears, and failure to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Ensure proper transmission fluid level and condition.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replace the ball joints. It's often recommended to replace both ball joints on the same axle at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, excessive white smoke upon startup, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plug(s). It's generally recommended to replace all glow plugs at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, sensors malfunctioning, and difficulty starting the engine. Corrosion issues, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair or replace damaged wiring. Apply dielectric grease to connections to prevent corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, depending on the extent of the damage. $100 - $1000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially Around Wheel Wells and Body Seams)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the body panels, particularly around the wheel wells, door seams, and rocker panels. Can lead to structural damage if left untreated.
    *   Solution: Treat the rust with a rust converter, repair or replace the affected panels, and repaint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, depending on the severity of the rust. $200 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: No air blowing from the vents, weak airflow, or unusual noises from the blower motor.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor. Resistor failure is also common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer 60) is generally considered a capable van, but reliability can be a concern. Engine issues, particularly related to injectors and turbochargers, are common. Transmission problems, suspension issues, and electrical faults also appear. Rust is a significant concern in regions with road salt. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, ranging from relatively minor fixes to major repairs costing several thousand dollars. Potential buyers should have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase to assess its condition and identify any potential problems.
