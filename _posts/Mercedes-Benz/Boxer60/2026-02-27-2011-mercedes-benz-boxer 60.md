### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Boxer 60 is a generally reliable commercial vehicle, with its diesel engines (2.3L and 3.0L JTDm) being robust but susceptible to issues like turbocharger problems and injector failures, which are common for high-mileage diesels. The manual transmission is solid, though clutch wear is expected. The automated manual transmission can experience actuator issues. Suspension components like ball joints and shock absorbers may require attention over time. Electrical systems can suffer from wiring harness corrosion, and alternators can fail. Exterior body panels are prone to rust in certain areas, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor and seat upholstery can show wear. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the Boxer 60 remains a dependable choice for commercial use.
