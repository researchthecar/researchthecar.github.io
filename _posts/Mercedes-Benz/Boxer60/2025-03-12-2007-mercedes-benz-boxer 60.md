The 2007 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (marketed as the "Boxer 60" in some regions and also sold under the Freightliner name) is a popular van known for its versatility and cargo capacity. Engine options include a 2.1L inline-4 diesel engine (CDI) and a 3.0L V6 diesel engine (CDI). The 2.1L diesel produces around 109 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L V6 generates approximately 154 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission is typically a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Sprinter's fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel engines), spacious interior, and smooth ride. However, common complaints include higher maintenance costs compared to domestic vans and potential issues with specific components like the emissions system and electrical components.
