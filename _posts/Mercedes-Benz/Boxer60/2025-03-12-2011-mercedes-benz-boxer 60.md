The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Boxer 60 is a commercial van known for its practicality and versatility, commonly used for delivery services, transportation, and conversions into campervans. Engine options varied depending on the market, but could include diesel engines like the 2.2L CDI. Power output varied depending on the specific engine tune, but generally produced around 100-160 horsepower and 250-350 Nm of torque. Owners often appreciate the Boxer 60 for its spacious cargo area and relatively comfortable ride for a commercial vehicle. Common dislikes include its basic interior and potential for certain mechanical issues as it ages. Information on specific issues related to the "Boxer 60" is difficult to verify due to potentially regional differences. I am basing this off of common issues with similar Mercedes-Benz vans of the same era such as the Sprinter.

**Engine**

**2.2L CDI Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased power, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine stalling. Error codes related to fuel injection faults will be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). A diagnostic scan to pinpoint the specific injector is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector, including labor and diagnostic fees.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, increased emissions, rough idle, and potential stalling. The check engine light will likely illuminate.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the EGR valve can sometimes temporarily resolve the issue, but replacement is often necessary for a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600, depending on whether cleaning or replacement is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noise from the engine bay, significant loss of power, black smoke, and increased oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement is usually necessary. Check for oil leaks in the turbocharger system, indicating potential oil starvation issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Automatic Transmission (Specific Type Unspecified - varies by market)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, slipping between gears, and overall poor transmission performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $3,000+ depending on whether a rebuild or replacement is performed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, transmission slipping, and potential for the transmission to get stuck in a particular gear.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuilding of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, particularly at the rear, uneven tire wear, and a generally bouncy or unstable ride.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on parts and labor to replace leaf springs on both sides.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, sensors malfunctioning, or the vehicle failing to start. Corrosion is a common cause.

**Summary**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Boxer 60, while a practical and spacious commercial van, can experience a range of issues as it ages. Engine problems such as fuel injector and EGR valve failures, and turbocharger issues can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and valve body, are also common. Suspension, electrical, and exterior problems can also arise. The severity of these issues varies, but overall maintenance and repair costs can be significant for this vehicle, especially if neglected. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchase decision.
