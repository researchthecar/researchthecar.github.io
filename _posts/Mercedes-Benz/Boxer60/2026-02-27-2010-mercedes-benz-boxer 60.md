### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz Boxer 60 is a generally reliable commercial vehicle, with its diesel engines and robust chassis proving durable under typical operating conditions. The most common reported issues tend to be related to emissions systems (EGR, DPF on some variants), turbocharger longevity, and wear on clutch components in manual transmissions. Electrical gremlins, particularly with wiring harnesses, can also arise. Exterior corrosion is a concern in areas with harsh climates. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of wear, especially on high-mileage vehicles, are key to maintaining optimal performance and avoiding costly repairs.
