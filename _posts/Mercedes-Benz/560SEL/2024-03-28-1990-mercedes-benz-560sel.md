* **Head Gasket Failure:** Occurs when the head gasket between the cylinder head and engine block fails, causing coolant and oil to leak. Symptoms include overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and loss of coolant. Repair involves replacing the head gasket and resurfacing the cylinder head. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
* **Cam Position Sensor Failure:** The camshaft position sensor (CPS) monitors the timing of the camshaft. A faulty CPS can cause ignition problems, poor engine performance, and stalling. Repair involves replacing the sensor. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Sun Gear Failure:** The sun gear is a critical part of the planetary gearset within the transmission. Failure of the sun gear can cause the transmission to slip or become inoperable. Repair involves replacing the sun gear and rebuilding the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+

**Electrical**

* **Climate Control Unit Failure:** The climate control unit regulates the heating and cooling system. A faulty unit can result in incorrect temperature control, blower issues, or other electrical problems. Repair involves replacing the unit. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator produces electricity and charges the battery. A faulty alternator can lead to battery drain, dim headlights, and electrical issues. Repair involves replacing the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**Summary**

The 1990 Mercedes-Benz 560SEL was a luxurious and competent sedan, but it was not without its issues. The engine and transmission had the most significant problems, which could be costly to repair.
