The 2007 Mercedes-Benz E550 is a luxury sedan known for its powerful performance and comfortable ride. It came standard with a 5.5L naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 382 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). Some owners praise the E550 for its smooth ride, powerful engine, and luxurious features, while others dislike its high maintenance costs and potential for electrical issues. Other E-Class models available that year included smaller engine options.

**Engine**

**5.5L V8 (M273)**
* **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some M273 engines, particularly those produced earlier in the engine's lifecycle, have been reported to have issues with the camshaft adjuster bolts failing. This can lead to ticking noises, rough running, and in severe cases, engine damage.
    * Solution: Replacing the camshaft adjuster bolts with updated, stronger bolts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks originating from the valve cover gaskets. This is a common issue as the gaskets age and harden. The oil leak can drip onto the exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell.
    * Solution: Replacing the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600

* **Oil Filter Housing Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leak originating from the oil filter housing gasket. This can drip down the engine, causing a burning smell and oil loss.
    * Solution: Replacing the oil filter housing gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (7G-Tronic)**
* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or hesitation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Can also manifest as rough shifting.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter or rebuilding the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifting, or failure to shift. Can trigger a "limp mode" restricting speed.
    * Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body. Sometimes a fluid change and adaptation reset can temporarily alleviate the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

* **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission stuck in gear, or complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacing the conductor plate.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500

**Suspension**

* **Airmatic System Failure (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, particularly after the car has been parked for a while. The car may sit unevenly. Fault codes related to the Airmatic system.
    * Solution: Replacing leaking air struts, the air compressor, or the valve block.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,000 for the compressor, $300 - $700 for the valve block.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Front Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the front lower control arms or just the bushings (if possible).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side (control arm replacement)

**Electrical**

* **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Key not recognized, unable to start the car, steering lock malfunctions.
    * Solution: Replacing the EIS and potentially reprogramming keys.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various electrical malfunctions, such as lights not working, wipers malfunctioning, or central locking problems.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty SAM unit and potentially reprogramming it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ depending on the SAM unit.

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Car battery draining overnight or within a few days, requiring frequent jump starts.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic drain, which could be a faulty module or wiring issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the cause, $200 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof failing to open or close properly, getting stuck, or making excessive noise. Water leaks.
    * Solution: Repairing or replacing the sunroof motor, rails, or seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+

    * Solution: Replacing the amplifier.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz E550, while offering a luxurious and powerful driving experience, is prone to several issues. The most concerning are the potential engine issues with the camshaft adjuster bolts and valve cover gasket leaks. The transmission can also have issues that are costly to fix. Suspension issues, particularly with the Airmatic system (if equipped), and electrical problems such as EIS and SAM failures, can also lead to significant repair bills. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making it crucial to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic experienced with Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
