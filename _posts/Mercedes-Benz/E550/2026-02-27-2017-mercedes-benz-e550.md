### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz E550 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but potential buyers should be aware of its specific reliability concerns. The twin-turbo V8 engine, while potent, can be susceptible to turbocharger and oil leak issues. The advanced 7-speed automatic transmission may require attention to its control module or torque converter. For models equipped with AIRMATIC suspension, leaks and compressor failures are notable potential expenses. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also reported. While the exterior and standard suspension tend to be robust, the complexity of the E550's systems means that proactive maintenance and a budget for potential repairs are advisable for long-term ownership satisfaction.
