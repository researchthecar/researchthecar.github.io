The 2017 Mercedes-Benz A45 AMG is a high-performance hatchback known for its powerful turbocharged engine and sporty handling. In North America, the A45 was not officially sold and only made it over through the grey market import channels, with most of these being located in Canada. This is due to how the vehicle was only offered as a hatchback, which is not very popular in North America. The 2017 A45 AMG features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 375 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and standard all-wheel drive. Owners often praise its exhilarating acceleration, agile handling, and aggressive styling. Common complaints include a firm ride, limited rear passenger space, and relatively high running costs.
