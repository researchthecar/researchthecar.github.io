The 2008 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG is a high-performance luxury sedan equipped with a powerful 6.2-liter V8 engine producing 518 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. While the S-Class is known for its comfort and features, some owners have reported specific issues. Common likes include the powerful engine, luxurious interior, and comfortable ride. Dislikes often revolve around high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and age-related issues. Other engine options available on the 2008 S-Class include various V6 and V8 engines, and a V12, but the S63 AMG is specifically equipped with the 6.2L V8.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (also known as camshaft sprocket bolts) can be prone to failure. Symptoms include ticking noises from the engine, especially on startup, and potential engine misfires or stalling if the bolts break entirely. The broken bolts can also cause significant internal engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the original camshaft adjuster bolts with the updated, higher-strength bolts. It's recommended to replace all bolts as a preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on if there is additional damage from the bolts breaking)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter/Hydraulic Lash Adjuster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noises from the engine, particularly when cold. These noises may lessen or disappear as the engine warms up, but they can return under different driving conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected valve lifters/lash adjusters. In some cases, it may be recommended to replace all lifters, as others could be nearing failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets, Oil Filter Housing, Oil Cooler)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the engine, oil spots under the car, and a burning oil smell. Low oil level warnings may also appear.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. This may involve replacing the valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, or oil cooler seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gaskets ($500-$1,000), Oil filter housing ($800-$1,500), Oil cooler ($1,000 - $2,000+)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9) 7-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to transmission solenoids or valve body function are often present.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild. Some shops offer remanufactured valve bodies with updated components that address common failure points.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially during acceleration or at low speeds. Stalling, poor fuel economy, and transmission slippage can also occur.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. It is often recommended to flush the transmission and replace the filter during this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Issues (Air Leaks, Compressor Failure, Strut Failure)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car sits unevenly, rides harshly, or the suspension fails to raise or lower. Error messages related to the Airmatic system appear on the dashboard. A hissing sound may be heard near the struts, indicating an air leak. Compressor may run constantly or fail to turn on.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the leaking air struts, compressor, or air lines. Addressing leaks promptly can prevent further damage to the compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air struts ($1,000 - $2,500 per strut), Compressor ($800 - $1,500), Air line repair ($200 - $500)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Electronic Control Unit (ECU) or Module Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A wide range of issues can occur, including engine performance problems, transmission shifting issues, malfunctioning sensors, and failure of various electronic systems. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) will likely be present.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the faulty ECU or module, followed by replacement and reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ (depending on the module)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for a few days. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the parasitic draw and repair the faulty component or wiring. This may involve testing various circuits and components to isolate the draw.

**Summary**

The 2008 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG, while a powerful and luxurious vehicle, is prone to several age-related issues, particularly with the engine, transmission, suspension, and electronics. The M156 engine's camshaft adjuster bolt and valve lifter problems can be costly to repair. The Airmatic suspension and complex electronics also contribute to potential maintenance expenses. Addressing these issues proactively can help to minimize the severity and cost of repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into the overall cost of ownership.
