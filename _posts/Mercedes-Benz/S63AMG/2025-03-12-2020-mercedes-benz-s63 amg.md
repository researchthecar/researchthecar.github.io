The 2020 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG is a high-performance luxury sedan that combines opulent features with a potent engine. While the S-Class is generally known for its reliability, the AMG variant can present specific issues. The S63 is equipped with a handcrafted 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 603 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission (AMG Speedshift MCT 9G). Owners often praise its luxurious interior, powerful performance, and advanced technology, but some common complaints revolve around electronic glitches, air suspension problems, and the high cost of maintenance and repairs.
