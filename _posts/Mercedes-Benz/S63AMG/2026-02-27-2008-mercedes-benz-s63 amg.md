### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG is a formidable performance luxury vehicle, but its complexity, particularly the AMG-specific engine and Active Body Control suspension, means potential owners should be prepared for higher maintenance and repair costs. Key areas to monitor include the M156 engine's head bolts and oil seals, the SPEEDSHIFT transmission's torque converter, and the ABC suspension's hydraulic system. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the SAM units, can also arise. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, specific electronic components within the cabin can be prone to failure. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these risks and ensuring the longevity of this high-performance machine.
