### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG offers exhilarating performance and luxury, but its advanced systems can lead to specific reliability concerns. The powerful 5.5L twin-turbo V8, while potent, can experience issues with wastegate actuators and oil coolers. The AMG SPEEDSHIFT transmission may encounter problems with the torque converter or mechatronics unit. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. While the exterior is generally robust, interior components like seat actuators and ambient lighting can develop faults. Owners should be prepared for potentially high repair costs associated with these complex systems, emphasizing the importance of thorough pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance.
