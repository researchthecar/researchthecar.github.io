The 2009 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG is a high-performance luxury sedan boasting a hand-built 6.2L naturally aspirated V8 engine, delivering 518 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. This engine was mated to a 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission. While lauded for its powerful engine, luxurious appointments, and comfortable ride, some owners have reported experiencing specific issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Common likes include the aggressive styling, potent engine, and opulent interior. Dislikes often revolve around maintenance costs, complicated electronics, and potential for expensive repairs. There was also an S550 model available which came equipped with a 5.5L V8 non-AMG engine and a similar 7-Speed transmission.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster (Cam Phaser) Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The bolts securing the camshaft adjusters can be prone to failure. Symptoms include engine rattling, especially on startup, check engine light, and potentially reduced engine performance. This issue is more prevalent in earlier production M156 engines.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft adjuster bolts with updated, stronger bolts. In some cases, the camshaft adjusters themselves may need replacement if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of damage and if new camshaft adjusters are necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise, especially when the engine is cold, potentially caused by worn or sticky hydraulic valve lifters.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected valve lifters. In severe cases, camshaft replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vacuum leaks resulting in rough idling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found
