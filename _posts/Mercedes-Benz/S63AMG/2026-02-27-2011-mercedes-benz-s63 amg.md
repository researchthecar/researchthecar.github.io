### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its complexity, particularly the AMG engine and ABC suspension, can lead to significant repair costs if issues arise. The M156 engine's timing chain tensioner is a known potential failure point that requires attention. The Active Body Control suspension, while providing excellent ride quality, is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which are costly to repair. Transmission issues, though less common, can also be expensive. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, are not unheard of. Prospective buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair expenses, and a thorough pre-purchase inspection focusing on these specific areas is highly recommended.
