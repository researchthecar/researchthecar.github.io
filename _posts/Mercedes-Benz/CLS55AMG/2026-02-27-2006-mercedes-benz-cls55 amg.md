### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz CLS55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its performance comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly in its advanced systems. The 5.4L supercharged V8 engine, while potent, can experience issues like supercharger belt failure and intercooler leaks. The 5-speed automatic transmission, though robust, may develop problems with its control module or conductor plate. The most significant potential expense lies in the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, which is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, often leading to costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the SAM module, can also surface. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, owners should be prepared for the maintenance costs associated with these high-performance components.
