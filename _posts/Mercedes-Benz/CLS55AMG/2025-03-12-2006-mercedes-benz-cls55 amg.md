The 2006 Mercedes-Benz CLS55 AMG is a high-performance sedan that blends luxury with impressive power. While it came standard with the 5.5L Supercharged V8 engine, offering a staggering 469 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, the CLS lineup did have other engine options for the non-AMG models. The CLS55 AMG was only available with the 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the car's distinctive coupe-like styling, powerful engine, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include higher maintenance costs associated with the AMG model and the complexity of the vehicle's electronics.

**Engine**

**5.5L Supercharged V8 (M113K)**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump circulates coolant through the intercooler to cool the intake air charge. A failing pump leads to reduced supercharger efficiency and a noticeable loss of power, especially in hot weather. Can cause the car to go into limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump with an updated or aftermarket version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on pump and labor

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, often dripping onto the exhaust manifold and causing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600

*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger clutch engages and disengages the supercharger based on demand. Failure leads to loss of supercharger boost and a significant reduction in power. A distinct rattling or grinding noise may be heard.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger clutch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**

    *   Solution: Replace the conductor plate and filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during acceleration. Can also cause slipping and poor fuel economy.
