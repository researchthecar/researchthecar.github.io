The 2016 Mercedes-Benz E400 is a mid-size luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and strong performance. The E400 is equipped with a 3.0L Twin-Turbo V6 engine producing 329 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. The E-Class in 2016 also offered other engine choices, including a 2.0L Turbo 4-cylinder in the E300 and a 3.5L V6 in the E350. A common point of praise is the E400's smooth ride and powerful engine. Criticisms tend to focus on the complexity of the infotainment system and some reported reliability concerns. All engine options were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission.
