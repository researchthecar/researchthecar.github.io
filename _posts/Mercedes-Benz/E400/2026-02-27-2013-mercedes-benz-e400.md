### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz E400 presents a generally solid reliability record, with most reported issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic failure. The 3.5L V6 engine is robust, though minor oil leaks and PCV issues can arise. The 7G-Tronic Plus transmission is generally reliable, but torque converter and TCM problems, while not universal, are the most significant potential transmission concerns.
