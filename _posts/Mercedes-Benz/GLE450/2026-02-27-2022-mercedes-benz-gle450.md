### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLE450 demonstrates strong overall reliability, particularly concerning its core powertrain (3.0L inline-six engine and 9-speed automatic transmission), which shows no significant widespread issues. The primary areas of concern are related to the optional Air Body Control suspension, which can develop leaks, and occasional electrical gremlins, primarily software glitches within the MBUX infotainment system or premature 12V battery failure. These issues, while not universal, are the most commonly reported technical faults. For owners with the standard suspension, reliability is generally higher. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are recommended to ensure long-term dependability.
