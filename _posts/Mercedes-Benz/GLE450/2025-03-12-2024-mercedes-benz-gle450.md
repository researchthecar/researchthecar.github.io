    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause the engine to run roughly, especially during acceleration, and may trigger the check engine light. This can be caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on how many need to be replaced.

    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic (725.0)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or jerkiness during gear changes, particularly between lower gears. This can sometimes be attributed to the transmission control unit (TCU) needing a software update or adaptive learning reset.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission software update, resetting the TCU's adaptive learning, or, in more severe cases, replacing the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for software updates; $800-$2000+ for valve body replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into drive or reverse and the vehicle actually moving. This can indicate issues with the transmission's internal clutches or valve body.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to determine the cause; potential repair or replacement of the valve body, clutch packs, or the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $5000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may sag on one side, fail to maintain ride height, or display warning messages related to the air suspension system. These issues can stem from leaks in the air struts, a malfunctioning air compressor, or a faulty ride height sensor.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing leaks in the air struts, replacing the air compressor, or replacing ride height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ per strut, $800 - $1500+ for the air compressor, $300 - $600+ for ride height sensors.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MBUX Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX system may freeze, reboot unexpectedly, or experience software glitches affecting navigation, audio, or other connected services.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates (if under warranty); $1000 - $3000+ for MBUX unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous warnings or failures in the operation of parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, or other driver-assistance systems.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor depending on location and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when the car is parked for an extended period, making it difficult to start. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from an electrical component or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnostics to identify the source of the parasitic draw, repairing the faulty component, or replacing the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 for diagnostics; $200 - $500+ for battery replacement; component repair costs vary.
    *   Recalls: None Found
