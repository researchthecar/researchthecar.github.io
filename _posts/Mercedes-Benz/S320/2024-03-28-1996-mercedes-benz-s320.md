**Introduction**

The 1996 Mercedes-Benz S320 is a luxury sedan praised for its refined interior, smooth ride, and powerful engine. It comes equipped with a 3.2-liter V6 engine producing 228 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Other engine and transmission options were not available for this particular model year.

**Engine**

**3.2-liter V6**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, leading to a loss of timing and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine and a misfire. The solution is to replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500
* **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure:** A faulty crankshaft position sensor can disrupt the engine's ignition timing, causing difficulty starting and stalling. Replacing the sensor resolves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** The transmission may slip gears, leading to a loss of power and acceleration problems. This issue can be caused by worn clutch packs or a failing torque converter. Transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Leaks:** The air suspension system may develop leaks, causing the vehicle to sag or become uneven. Replacing the faulty air struts or lines solves the problem. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $1,800 per corner

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail, resulting in a loss of power, electrical problems, and a discharged battery. Replacing the alternator is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
* **Heated Seat Switch Malfunction:** The heated seat switches can malfunction, causing the seats to remain cold or overheat. Repair involves replacing the faulty switch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $350

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof Water Leaks:** The sunroof can develop leaks, allowing water to enter the cabin. Replacing the sunroof seal or adjusting the sunroof frame can resolve the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**Interior**

* **Power Window Motor Failure:** The power window motors may fail, causing the affected windows to become inoperable. Replacing the failed motor is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $400 per window
* **A/C Blower Motor Failure:** The A/C blower motor can fail, resulting in a loss of air circulation inside the cabin. Replacement of the blower motor fixes the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**Summary**

The 1996 Mercedes-Benz S320 is a well-built luxury car, but it is not without its issues. Timing chain tensioner and crankshaft position sensor failures are common engine problems, while transmission slippage can also occur. Electrical issues are relatively minor, but suspension leaks can be costly to repair. Interior problems are generally limited to power window and A/C blower motor failures. While some issues have the potential to be expensive, the overall cost of ownership for this vehicle is reasonable.
