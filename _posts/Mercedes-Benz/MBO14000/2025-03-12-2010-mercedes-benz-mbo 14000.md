The 2010 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 (MBO 14000 refers to the internal Mercedes platform designation, not commonly used by consumers) is a compact luxury SUV known for its boxy styling and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 3.5L V6 gasoline engine producing around 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the GLK350's build quality, handling, and the availability of 4MATIC all-wheel drive. Common criticisms include a somewhat dated interior and less cargo space compared to some competitors.
