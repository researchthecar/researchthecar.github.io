The 2014 Mercedes-Benz Viano 900, also known as the Metris or Vito in some markets, is a versatile van often used for both commercial and passenger transport. Engine options generally include a range of gasoline and diesel engines depending on the market. Common gasoline options include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing approximately 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Diesel engine options often consist of a 2.1L four-cylinder producing varying outputs based on the tune. Both engines were commonly paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Viano/Metris/Vito for its practicality, spaciousness, and Mercedes-Benz build quality, while common dislikes include its relatively basic interior compared to Mercedes-Benz passenger cars, potential for higher running costs, and some market-specific reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2014 Mercedes-Benz Viano/Metris/Vito can be a practical and spacious vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, such as turbocharger or HPFP failures (gasoline) or DPF clogging and injector faults (diesel), can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, particularly valve body and torque converter problems in the 7G-Tronic automatic, are also notable. Suspension and electrical malfunctions, especially related to sliding doors and window regulators, add to the potential for higher maintenance expenses. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate inconvenience to potentially expensive repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and its complexity. Prospective buyers should prioritize a thorough inspection and maintenance history review before making a purchase.
