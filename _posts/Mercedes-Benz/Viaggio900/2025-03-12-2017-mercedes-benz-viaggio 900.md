The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Viaggio 900, also known as the V-Class, is a luxury van known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and premium features. While engine and transmission options may vary by region and market, common choices include a range of diesel engines (such as the 2.1L inline-4) and gasoline engines (such as a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4), typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC PLUS). The 2.1L diesel can produce upwards of 190 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the V-Class for its versatility, passenger comfort, and refined driving experience. Some criticisms include its relatively high price point and potentially complex electronics.
