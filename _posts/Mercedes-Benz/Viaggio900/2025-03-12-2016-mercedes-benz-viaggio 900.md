The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Vito/Viano (known as the Viaggio 900 in some markets) is a versatile van offered in various configurations for passenger and commercial use. Engine options typically include a range of diesel engines. For example, the 2.1L diesel produces around 136 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque in its base configuration and is generally liked for its fuel efficiency, and the available space for passengers or cargo. Dislikes often center around the base models feeling somewhat spartan compared to luxury-focused Mercedes-Benz vehicles and potential for higher repair costs associated with the brand. The most common transmission option is a 7-speed automatic.
