The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Vito (known as the Viaggio 900 in some markets) is a versatile van offering practicality and comfort. Engine options typically include a range of diesel engines, such as the 2.1-liter four-cylinder, and a 3.0-liter V6. Power output varies depending on the specific engine tune, with horsepower ranging from approximately 136 to 190 hp for the 2.1L and around 258 hp for the 3.0L. Torque figures range from 330 Nm to 440 Nm for the 2.1L and around 340 Nm for the 3.0L. Owners often appreciate its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reputation for reliability. However, some common complaints revolve around electronic glitches, premature wear of certain components, and relatively higher maintenance costs compared to other vans in its class. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.1L Diesel Engine**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clogging of the DPF leading to reduced engine performance, warning lights on the dashboard, and potential limp mode. Often caused by short trips that don't allow the DPF to regenerate properly.
    * Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF (either by driving at sustained high speeds or using a diagnostic tool), cleaning the DPF, or replacement in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the method and extent of damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage. Often caused by contaminated fuel or general wear and tear.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty injector(s) and replacement with new units. Recoding the new injectors to the ECU is also required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ depending on the number of injectors replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6 Diesel Engine**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various locations including the oil cooler seals, valve cover gaskets, and rear main seal. Leads to oil consumption and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty seals or gaskets. More extensive repairs may be necessary if the leak has been ongoing for a long time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the location and complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. Hesitation when accelerating. Can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or issues with the torque converter.
    * Solution: Checking and topping up the transmission fluid level, performing a transmission fluid and filter change, repairing or replacing the valve body, or replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3000+ (torque converter replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, especially at one corner of the vehicle. The compressor may run constantly or fail to operate. Air leaks from the air springs or lines.
    * Solution: Identifying and repairing the air leaks (usually by replacing the air springs or air lines), replacing the air suspension compressor, or replacing the height sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2500+ depending on the specific component that needs to be replaced.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Central Locking System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Doors failing to lock or unlock remotely or with the key, erratic behavior of the central locking system.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the issue with a scan tool, checking the wiring harness for damage, replacing the central locking actuator, or replacing the central locking control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the cause of the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Failure (Diesel Engines)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficult starting in cold weather, rough idling, and excessive smoke from the exhaust during startup.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty glow plug(s). It's often recommended to replace all glow plugs at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding doors, unusual noises during operation, or failure of the power sliding door mechanism (if equipped).
    * Solution: Lubricating the door tracks and rollers, adjusting the door alignment, replacing the door rollers or cables, or repairing/replacing the power sliding door motor and control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (lubrication/adjustment) - $1000+ (power door motor replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Malfunctioning Power Windows**
    * Description/Symptoms: Windows that fail to operate, only work intermittently, or make unusual noises during operation.
    * Solution: Checking the window switch, checking the wiring harness for damage, replacing the window regulator, or replacing the window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Vito/Viaggio 900, while generally reliable, can experience issues ranging from relatively minor electrical glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. DPF issues and injector failures can impact engine performance, while transmission problems can lead to rough shifting. Air suspension, if equipped, can be a source of expense. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the specific issue, but owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs compared to other vans.
