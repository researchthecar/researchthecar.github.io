### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Viaggio 900 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its chassis and exterior components. The primary areas requiring attention are typically related to the diesel engine's emissions control systems (DPF, EGR) and, in some cases, turbocharger longevity, especially with the 2.3L variant. Transmission issues, while not rampant, can occur with the automated manual, primarily concerning actuator performance. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, are also a possibility. For owners, proactive maintenance and addressing early warning signs for engine and transmission systems are recommended to maintain optimal performance and avoid more costly repairs.
