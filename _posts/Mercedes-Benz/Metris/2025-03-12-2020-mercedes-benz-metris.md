The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Metris is a mid-size van offered in both passenger and cargo configurations, known for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency relative to larger vans, and Mercedes-Benz build quality. The Metris is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 7G-TRONIC 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Metris for its compact size and ease of parking, as well as its comfortable ride and practical cargo capacity.
