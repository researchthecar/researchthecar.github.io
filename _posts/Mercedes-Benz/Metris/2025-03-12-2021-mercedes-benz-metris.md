The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Metris is a versatile mid-size van, often praised for its maneuverability, cargo capacity, and comfortable ride compared to larger vans. However, it's often criticized for its basic interior features, and some find the engine performance adequate but not particularly powerful. The 2021 Metris is exclusively powered by a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 gasoline engine producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M274)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the valve cover gasket, timing chain cover, and oil filter housing. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or component is typically required. Thorough cleaning of the affected area is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, reduced engine power, and illuminated check engine light. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to camshaft timing are often present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic (725.0/9G-Tronic)**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. May be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission control module (TCM) software update can resolve the issue. In other instances, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update) to $4,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into drive or reverse and the transmission actually engaging.
    *   Solution: Fluid level check and top off, but in most cases a more significant problem may exist, such as a failing valve body or torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid) to $4,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Uneven tire wear may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$800 depending on the bushing and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Multiple sensor failures, particularly those related to the emissions system (e.g., oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensor). Check engine light illumination is common.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery or difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of parasitic draw and repair of the affected circuit or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1,000+ depending on the complexity of the electrical issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding doors, sticking, or unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the door tracks and rollers may provide temporary relief. Replacement of worn rollers, cables, or the door latch mechanism may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$1,000+ depending on the part and amount of labor required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes intermittently.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Metris can experience a range of issues, from relatively minor sensor failures to more significant engine and transmission problems. Oil leaks and rough shifting seem to be the most reported issues. While some repairs are inexpensive, others, particularly those involving the transmission, can be costly. Carefully inspect a used Metris and obtain a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify potential problems before buying.
