The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Metris is a mid-size van lauded for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and cargo capacity, making it a popular choice for small businesses and families alike. Itâ€™s powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7G-TRONIC 7-speed automatic transmission. While owners appreciate its compact size and Mercedes-Benz badge, common complaints include reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system, and some find the interior to be somewhat basic compared to other Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
