The 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLA 250 is a subcompact luxury SUV that offers a blend of style, performance, and technology. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. An AMG version, the GLA 35, is also available with a more powerful engine. People generally appreciate the GLA250's upscale interior, nimble handling, and advanced tech features. Some common complaints revolve around the relatively small cargo space and the sometimes-complicated infotainment system.
