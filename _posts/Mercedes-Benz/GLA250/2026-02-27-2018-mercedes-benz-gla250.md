The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 demonstrates a generally good reliability record, particularly in its suspension, exterior, and interior components, which show no widespread significant issues. The primary areas of concern tend to be the powertrain and electrical systems. Owners may encounter issues with the turbocharger or PCV valve in the engine, and the dual-clutch transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting or require attention to its control module. Electrical problems, such as infotainment system glitches and intermittent battery drain, are also reported.
