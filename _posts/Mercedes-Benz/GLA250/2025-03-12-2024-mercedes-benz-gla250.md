The 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 is a compact luxury SUV known for its stylish design, agile handling, and comfortable interior. The GLA250 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and uses an 8-speed automatic transmission. It is offered in both front-wheel-drive (FWD) and all-wheel-drive (AWD) configurations (GLA250 4MATIC). Owners generally appreciate the GLA250's upscale cabin, user-friendly technology, and fuel efficiency. Common complaints often center around the relatively small cargo space for its class and the potentially firm ride quality, depending on the road conditions and chosen options.

**Engine**
