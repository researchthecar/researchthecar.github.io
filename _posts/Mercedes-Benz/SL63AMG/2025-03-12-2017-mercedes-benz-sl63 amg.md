The 2017 Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG is a high-performance roadster that offers a thrilling driving experience. It's equipped with a handcrafted 5.5-liter biturbo V8 engine producing 577 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque, coupled with a 7-speed AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT transmission. While praised for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and refined handling, some owners have reported encountering certain issues.
