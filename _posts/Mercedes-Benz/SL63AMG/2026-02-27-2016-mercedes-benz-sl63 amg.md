### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG is a high-performance vehicle that, while offering immense driving pleasure, comes with potential reliability considerations typical of its class and complexity. The twin-turbo V8 engine is generally robust, but issues with wastegate actuators and coolant leaks can occur. The AMG SPEEDSHIFT transmission is largely dependable, though the TCM and torque converter are areas to monitor. The Active Body Control suspension, while advanced, is a known source of potential hydraulic leaks and costly repairs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are not uncommon. The retractable hardtop mechanism requires attention to ensure smooth operation. Overall, the SL63 AMG demands diligent maintenance and can incur significant repair costs for specific components, but for owners who prioritize performance and luxury, it remains a compelling option when well-maintained.
