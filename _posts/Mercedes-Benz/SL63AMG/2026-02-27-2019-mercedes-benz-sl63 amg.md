### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG is a high-performance vehicle that, while generally reliable, can present specific technical challenges. The most commonly reported issues tend to revolve around the complex Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, particularly hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. The twin-turbo V8 engine, while powerful, can experience issues with turbocharger actuators and coolant leaks. Transmission problems, such as TCM malfunctions and torque converter issues, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, including infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, can occur. The convertible roof mechanism is another area where mechanical or hydraulic failures may arise. Owners should be prepared for potentially significant repair costs associated with these specialized components, especially those related to the ABC system and powertrain. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating these potential issues.
