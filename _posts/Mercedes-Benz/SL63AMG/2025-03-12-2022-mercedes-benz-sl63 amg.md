The 2022 Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG represents a significant redesign of the SL roadster, blending luxury with high performance. The SL63 AMG boasts a hand-built 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 577 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2022 SL include a 2.0L inline-4. All engines are paired with the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9-speed transmission. Owners often praise the SL63 AMG for its exhilarating performance, opulent interior, and improved handling compared to previous generations. Criticisms tend to focus on its high price point, some aspects of the infotainment system, and the potential for complex electronic issues.

**Engine**

**4.0L Twin-Turbo V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may occur from various points including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or turbocharger oil lines. Symptoms include visible oil puddles under the vehicle, burning oil smell, and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal. Proper torque specifications must be followed during reassembly. For turbo oil lines, ensure proper sealing and no kinks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+, depending on the location and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG, while offering impressive performance and luxury, does have some potential issues owners should be aware of. The most concerning problems revolve around the engine (oil leaks, turbocharger issues), transmission (rough shifting), and electrical system (infotainment glitches, sensor malfunctions). Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension, can also be costly to repair. While minor interior and exterior issues can be annoying, they are generally less severe. The potential repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousands for major engine or suspension overhauls. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any potential problems before committing to a purchase.
