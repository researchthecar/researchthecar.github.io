### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG is a formidable performance machine with a generally robust mechanical foundation. The twin-turbo V8 engine and transmission are typically reliable, though specific components like wastegate actuators and fuel injectors can occasionally present issues. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, while advanced, is a known area where hydraulic leaks or pump failures can occur, representing a significant repair cost. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and parasitic battery drains, are not uncommon in complex luxury vehicles of this era. The retractable hardtop mechanism also requires attention to ensure smooth operation. Overall, while not immune to issues, particularly those related to its advanced systems, the SL63 AMG offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury with manageable reliability if well-maintained.
