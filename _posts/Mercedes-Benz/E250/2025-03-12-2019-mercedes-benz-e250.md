The 2019 Mercedes-Benz E 250 is not a valid model. The closest and most similar is the 2019 Mercedes-Benz E 300. It's a popular luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, advanced technology, and elegant styling. The E 300 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 241 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available for the 2019 E-Class include a 3.0-liter biturbo V6 (E 450) and a handcrafted AMG 4.0-liter biturbo V8 (AMG E 63 S). All engines are paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission.
