### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz E250 offers a compelling blend of luxury and efficiency, but like many premium vehicles, it is not immune to potential issues. The diesel engine variants, particularly the 2.1L OM651, have seen reports of turbocharger, EGR valve, and DPF problems, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC PLUS transmission, while generally robust, can experience torque converter or valve body issues. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and headlight module problems, are also noted. Interior electronics, like the infotainment system, can occasionally glitch. Despite these potential concerns, many owners report a positive ownership experience, especially if maintenance is kept up to date. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common problem areas and factor in potential repair costs.
