### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz E250, particularly with its diesel engine, presents a generally reliable package, but owners should be aware of potential issues common to modern turbocharged diesel powertrains. The Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and EGR valve are key areas to monitor, as their maintenance and potential failure can be costly. Transmission issues, while not rampant, can occur and involve the torque converter or control module. Electrical gremlins, especially with sensors and control modules, are also a possibility, as is typical for vehicles with extensive electronic systems. The interior and exterior are generally robust, with isolated reports of infotainment or seat adjustment problems. Regular maintenance and addressing warning lights promptly are crucial for long-term reliability.
