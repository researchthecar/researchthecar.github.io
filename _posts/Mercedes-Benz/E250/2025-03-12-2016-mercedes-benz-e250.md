**Summary**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz E250, while offering a luxurious experience and good fuel economy, can present owners with several potential issues. The diesel engine is susceptible to DPF and AdBlue system problems, potentially leading to costly repairs. Transmission issues, especially with the torque converter and valve body, can also be a concern. Electrical glitches and air suspension problems (if equipped) can add to the maintenance burden. While some issues can be relatively inexpensive to address, others, like turbocharger failure or air strut replacement, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, including a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
