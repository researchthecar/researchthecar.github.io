However, some common complaints include the cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as potential issues with the diesel particulate filter (DPF) and other diesel-specific components.

**Engine**

**2.1L Diesel (OM651)**

*   **Faulty Injectors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced fuel economy, diesel smell, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the number of injectors and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clogged DPF, reduced engine power, warning lights on the dashboard, and increased fuel consumption. This can be caused by short journeys that don't allow the DPF to regenerate properly.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration, cleaning the DPF, or replacing the DPF if it's severely clogged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on the solution and DPF condition).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine, reduced power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9) 7-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, and potential transmission failure. Often caused by wear and debris accumulation in the valve body.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, stalling, and poor acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging, especially in the rear, failure to maintain ride height, warning lights on the dashboard, and noisy compressor operation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to compressor failure, with the vehicle sagging on one side or corner due to a leak in the air strut.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per strut.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the car, and needing frequent jump starts. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or component.
    *   Solution: Identifying and fixing the source of the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz E250, while offering a blend of luxury and fuel efficiency, is prone to certain issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the diesel engine, particularly the injectors, DPF, and turbocharger. Transmission problems, especially with the valve body, are also relatively common. Air suspension issues, if equipped, can add to the cost of ownership. Electrical problems, like battery drains and SAM module failures, can also arise. While some issues may be minor, others can be costly to repair, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection crucial. Overall, owning this vehicle will require commitment to preventative maintenance and awareness of these potential problems.
