The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, often utilized as a "Safety Bus" or support vehicle, offers a blend of utility and luxury. Engine choices typically include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 diesel, producing around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, which is favored for its fuel efficiency and suitable power for everyday tasks. A 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V6 with around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque may also be available. The Sprinter is generally appreciated for its spacious interior, customizable configurations, and Mercedes-Benz build quality. However, some owners have reported issues with the infotainment system, electrical components, and the overall cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Summary**
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Safety Bus configuration) presents a mix of potentially costly issues. Engine troubles, particularly those concerning the DPF on the diesel models and oil cooler leaks on the V6, can be expensive to address. Suspension and electrical system glitches, while less frequent, can also contribute to overall ownership costs. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate inconvenience (infotainment glitches) to potentially debilitating (DPF clogging, suspension failure). Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in higher-than-average maintenance costs when considering a used 2020 Sprinter.
