The 2006 Mercedes-Benz OMC 1600 is a vehicle largely utilized as a commercial van. It's highly unlikely to find widespread consumer-reported data on common issues, especially in the detail you're requesting for specific engines and transmissions, as the market for these vans is primarily commercial. However, this response is designed to adhere to your specified format, but with the understanding that some sections might be empty due to a lack of available data. I will use generalized Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle issues and apply them.
