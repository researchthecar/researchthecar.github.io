### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG is a formidable vehicle with a generally strong reliability record, especially considering its age and performance focus. However, potential owners should be aware of specific issues that can arise, particularly concerning the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, which can be costly to repair if leaks develop. The supercharged V8 engine, while powerful, can also present issues like supercharger belt wear and coolant leaks from the intake manifold. Transmission control modules and torque converters in the 5-speed automatic are also noted areas for potential concern. Electrical components, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, can also experience failures. Despite these potential drawbacks, many G55 AMGs are well-maintained and continue to provide a unique ownership experience. Thorough pre-purchase inspections and a budget for potential repairs are highly recommended.
