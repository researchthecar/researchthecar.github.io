The 2008 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG is a high-performance SUV known for its ruggedness, luxurious interior, and powerful engine. It was offered with a 5.4L Supercharged V8 engine that produced 500 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. There were no other engine options available for the G55 AMG that year. The G55 AMG comes standard with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its distinctive styling, off-road capabilities, and powerful engine. However, some common complaints include its high fuel consumption, stiff ride, and expensive maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**5.4L Supercharged V8**
*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump, responsible for circulating coolant through the intercoolers to cool the intake air, can fail. This results in reduced engine performance, particularly noticeable during hot weather or heavy acceleration. The engine may feel sluggish and lack power.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The supercharger clutch, responsible for engaging and disengaging the supercharger, can fail. The supercharger might produce a loud rattling or grinding noise, or it may not engage at all, leading to a significant decrease in horsepower.
    * Solution: Replace the supercharger clutch or the entire supercharger assembly depending on the extent of the damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+
*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets are common as the gaskets age. This can lead to oil dripping onto the exhaust manifolds, producing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter may fail, causing shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive. This is often more pronounced when shifting gears or accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the valve body can cause harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or a complete inability to shift.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor, which maintains the vehicle's ride height, can fail or become weak. This results in the vehicle sagging, particularly overnight, or the "Visit Workshop" message appearing on the dashboard related to the air suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. It's often recommended to replace the relay and filter simultaneously to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
*   **Air Suspension Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air struts can develop leaks over time, causing the vehicle to sag or sit unevenly. A hissing sound might be audible near the affected strut.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air strut(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+ per strut
* **Suspension Bushing Failure**
  * Description/Symptoms: The front suspension bushings can fail and cause clunking noises in the front suspension. Steering can also be affected and make the vehicle feel unstable.
  * Solution: Replace the front suspension bushings.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+

**Electrical**

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may fail to operate properly, often getting stuck or moving erratically. This is frequently due to a worn or broken window regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per window
*   **Heated Seat Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heated seats may stop working due to a faulty heating element or control module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop in various locations, particularly around the door hinges, tailgate, and underbody.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on severity, $200 - $3,000+
*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators may fail, making it difficult to lock or unlock the doors electronically. Manual operation may still be possible, but the electronic locking mechanism is compromised.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.

**Summary**

The 2008 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG, while a capable and luxurious SUV, can be prone to several issues. The most concerning are the engine-related issues, such as intercooler pump failure and supercharger clutch failure, which can significantly impact performance and require costly repairs. The air suspension system is another area of concern, with compressor and strut failures being relatively common and expensive to fix. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulator and heated seat malfunctions, can also add to the ownership costs. The rust issues can also be significant, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Overall, owning a 2008 G55 AMG requires a proactive approach to maintenance and a willingness to address potential problems as they arise. Be prepared for potentially high repair costs and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Mercedes-Benz mechanic.
