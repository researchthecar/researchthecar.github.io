### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG is a robust vehicle, but its age and performance-oriented nature mean certain components require attention. The supercharged V8 engine, while powerful, can experience issues like belt failure and coolant leaks. The 5-speed automatic transmission is generally reliable but can develop problems with the TCM or torque converter. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system is a notable area for potential costly repairs due to leaks. Electrical components, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, can also be sources of concern. Despite these potential issues, many G55 AMGs have been well-maintained, and with proactive servicing, they can remain dependable, albeit with higher than average running costs.
