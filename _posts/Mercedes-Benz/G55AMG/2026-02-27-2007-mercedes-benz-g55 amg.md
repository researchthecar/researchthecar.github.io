### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG is a formidable vehicle with a powerful engine and robust chassis. However, its age and performance-oriented nature mean certain components are prone to issues. The supercharged V8, while generally strong, can suffer from belt failures and coolant leaks. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a common source of expensive repairs due to hydraulic leaks. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and instrument clusters, are also noted. Transmission issues, though less frequent, can involve the TCM or torque converter. Regular, specialized maintenance is paramount to mitigate these potential problems and ensure the G55 AMG remains a reliable, albeit costly to maintain, luxury SUV.
