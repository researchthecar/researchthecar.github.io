The 2006 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG is a high-performance SUV known for its ruggedness, luxury, and distinctive boxy styling. While the G-Wagen has always been about capability, the AMG version adds a potent engine and performance-oriented features. The 2006 G55 AMG came with a single engine option, the 5.5L Supercharged V8, which produced 469 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically love the G55's unique combination of luxury, off-road prowess, and powerful engine. However, common complaints include high running costs (fuel, maintenance) and occasionally complex electrical systems.

**Engine**

**5.5L Supercharged V8 (M113K)**

*   **Supercharger Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump circulates coolant to cool the air entering the engine from the supercharger. When it fails, the engine can suffer from heat soak, leading to reduced power, hesitation, and potential damage from detonation.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This sensor is critical for engine timing. Failure leads to stalling, difficulty starting, or a complete no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets. This can lead to oil consumption, burning smells, and potential oil dripping onto hot exhaust components.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate inside the transmission houses the electrical components and sensors. Failure can lead to erratic shifting, getting stuck in gear, or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause slipping and hesitation during acceleration, shuddering, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body controls the flow of transmission fluid and shifting. Issues can cause hard shifts, slipping, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor provides the necessary air pressure to the air struts. When it fails, the vehicle will sag, often unevenly, and may display suspension warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air struts themselves can develop leaks, causing the vehicle to sag, especially overnight. A hissing sound may be audible near the leaking strut.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (per strut)

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The G55 AMG has a complex electrical system. Parasitic drain can lead to a dead battery, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic drain. This can involve checking various modules and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the source)
*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster can experience various issues, including pixelation, flickering, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can occur, particularly in areas prone to moisture and salt exposure (e.g., rocker panels, wheel arches, door bottoms).
    *   Solution: Repair the rust, and repaint the affected areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on severity)

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can fail, causing it to stick, leak, or not open/close properly.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the sunroof mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+

**Summary**

The 2006 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG, while a desirable vehicle, can suffer from a range of issues, particularly due to its age and complex systems. Engine and transmission problems, especially related to the supercharger and 722.6 transmission, can be costly. Air suspension issues are also common. Electrical problems and rust can add to the ownership costs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic specializing in Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.
