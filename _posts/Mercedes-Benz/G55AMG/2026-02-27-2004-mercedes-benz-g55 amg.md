### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG is a robust and capable vehicle, but its age and complex systems mean potential for specific issues. The supercharged V8 engine, while powerful, can develop leaks and belt-related problems. The 5-speed automatic transmission is generally reliable but can suffer from TCM or torque converter issues. Suspension, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) system if equipped, is a known area for costly repairs. Electrical components like window regulators and instrument clusters can also fail. Owners should budget for potentially expensive repairs, especially concerning the engine, transmission, and ABC system, and prioritize regular, specialized maintenance to mitigate these risks.
