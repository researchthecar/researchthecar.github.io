The 2010 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG is a high-performance SUV known for its iconic boxy design, luxurious interior, and powerful engine. The G55 AMG was only offered with one engine option, a 5.4L Supercharged V8 which produced 500 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the G55 AMG for its distinctive styling, off-road capabilities, and powerful acceleration.
