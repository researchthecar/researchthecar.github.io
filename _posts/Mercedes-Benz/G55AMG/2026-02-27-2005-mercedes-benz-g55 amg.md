### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG is a robust vehicle, but its age and high-performance nature mean certain components are prone to failure. The supercharged V8 engine, while powerful, can experience issues like supercharger belt wear and coolant leaks. The 5-speed automatic transmission, particularly its control module and torque converter, can also be a source of concern. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system is a notable area for potential costly repairs due to leaks. Electrical gremlins, especially with the BCM and window regulators, are not uncommon. Despite these potential issues, many G55 AMGs have been well-maintained, and with proactive attention to these known problem areas, the vehicle can remain a reliable and impressive machine.
