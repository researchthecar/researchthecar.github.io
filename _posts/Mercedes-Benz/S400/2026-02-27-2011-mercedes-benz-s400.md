### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz S400 presents a mixed reliability profile. The hybrid components, particularly the battery and associated electronics, are the most significant potential cost centers and sources of concern. Issues with the active suspension system (ABC) can also be expensive to repair. While the core V6 engine is generally robust, the complexity of the hybrid integration means that specialized knowledge and potentially higher repair costs are to be expected. Owners should be vigilant about warning lights and symptoms related to the hybrid system and suspension. Regular maintenance by qualified technicians is crucial to mitigate potential problems and ensure longevity.
