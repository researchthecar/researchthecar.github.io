### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz S400, while a technologically advanced luxury vehicle, presents potential reliability concerns primarily related to its hybrid components and complex electronic systems. The hybrid battery, electric motor, and power electronics module are significant cost centers if they fail. The sophisticated active suspension system can also be a source of expensive repairs. While the core engine and transmission are generally robust, issues with control modules and torque converters can arise. Electrical gremlins stemming from the Body Control Module and infotainment system are also noted. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance and repair costs compared to non-hybrid luxury sedans, especially concerning the hybrid powertrain and advanced suspension.
