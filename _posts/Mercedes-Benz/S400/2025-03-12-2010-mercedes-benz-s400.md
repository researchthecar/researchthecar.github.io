The 2010 Mercedes-Benz S400 Hybrid offered a blend of luxury and fuel efficiency. It was equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 295 horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque. While the S-Class is known for its comfortable ride, opulent interior, and advanced technology, the hybrid system and other components have been known to present some problems.
