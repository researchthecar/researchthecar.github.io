The 2006 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203 chassis) is a compact executive car known for its blend of luxury, performance, and practicality. While offering a refined driving experience, it's not without its common problems. Engine options varied, including the C230 Kompressor (1.8L supercharged inline-4, around 189 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque), the C280 (3.0L V6), and the C350 (3.5L V6). Transmission options were typically a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim. Owners often appreciate the car's comfortable ride, precise handling, and luxurious interior. However, common complaints include electrical issues, especially with the instrument cluster and window regulators, and potential problems with the engine and transmission, particularly as the car ages.
