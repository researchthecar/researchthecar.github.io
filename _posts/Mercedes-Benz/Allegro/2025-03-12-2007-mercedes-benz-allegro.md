The 2007 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, often referred to by its chassis code W203 in its final year, offers a blend of luxury and performance in a compact package. Common engine options for this year include the C230 with a 2.5L V6 engine producing around 201 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque, the C280/C300 with a 3.0L V6 producing around 228-230 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, and the C350 with a 3.5L V6 producing around 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both rear-wheel drive and 4MATIC all-wheel-drive systems were available. Transmission choices typically include a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automatic (7G-Tronic). Owners often appreciate the car's sophisticated styling, comfortable ride, and relatively fuel-efficient engines. Conversely, some common complaints revolve around electrical issues, certain engine-related problems, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203) has several potential issues that buyers should be aware of. Engine-related problems, particularly balance shaft wear in earlier M272 engines, can be costly to address. Transmission issues with the 7G-Tronic can also be a concern. Electrical gremlins related to the SAM module are common and can be difficult to diagnose. Suspension components like control arm bushings are prone to wear and tear. Rust can be a problem depending on the vehicle's history and location. While the car offers a luxurious experience, potential repair costs can be significant, making a thorough inspection essential before purchase.
