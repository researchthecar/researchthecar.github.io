The 2008 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, including the Allegro trim (likely a regional or package designation, possibly referring to the C200 Kompressor), offers a blend of luxury and performance. While specific "Allegro" models might have slight variations depending on the region and original packages, the core mechanics are the same as other C-Class models. Engine options typically include the 1.8L Supercharged inline-4 (C200 Kompressor), producing around 181 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, a 2.5L V6, and a 3.5L V6. The C-Class is generally praised for its comfortable ride and sophisticated styling. Some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the electronics, which can lead to expensive repairs, and the potential for rust in certain climates.
