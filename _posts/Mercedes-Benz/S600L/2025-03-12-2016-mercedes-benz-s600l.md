The 2016 Mercedes-Benz S600L is a luxurious and powerful sedan known for its opulent interior, advanced technology, and smooth ride. It came standard with a handcrafted 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 engine, producing 523 horsepower and 612 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with the 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the car's quiet cabin, comfortable seats, and extensive list of features, while others find the technology overly complex and the running costs potentially high. Other engine options include the S550 (4.7L V8), S550e (3.0L V6 Hybrid), and S63 AMG (5.5L V8), each with its unique set of characteristics. The S600L, however, delivers the most performance with the V12 engine and its focus on luxury makes it a premium choice.
