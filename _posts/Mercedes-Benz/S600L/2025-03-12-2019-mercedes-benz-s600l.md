The 2019 Mercedes-Benz S600L represents the pinnacle of luxury and performance within the S-Class lineup. This model year came standard with a handcrafted 6.0L twin-turbo V12 engine producing 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. The S600L was only offered with the 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic transmission.
