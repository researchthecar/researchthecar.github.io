### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mercedes-Benz GL550 is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.7L twin-turbo V8 can experience turbocharger issues and coolant leaks. The 7-speed automatic transmission may develop shuddering or hesitation. The AIRMATIC air suspension system is prone to leaks and compressor failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While many components are robust, the potential for expensive repairs in the engine, transmission, and especially the air suspension, warrants careful pre-purchase inspection and consideration of extended warranty options.
