### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz GL550 is a capable luxury SUV, but its complexity means potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The V8 engine, while powerful, can suffer from timing chain and intake manifold issues. The 7G-TRONIC transmission is prone to valve body and torque converter problems. The optional AIRMATIC suspension is a common source of costly repairs due to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM unit, and interior electronic glitches are also noted. Despite these potential issues, many GL550s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to emerging problems. Buyers should factor in potential repair costs, especially for the suspension and transmission.
