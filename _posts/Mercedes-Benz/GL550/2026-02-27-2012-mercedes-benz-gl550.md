### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz GL550 is a capable luxury SUV, but potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.7L V8 engine can experience timing chain wear and oil leaks, while the 7G-TRONIC transmission may develop issues with the torque converter or valve body. The AIRMATIC air suspension is a common source of problems, with leaks and compressor failures being prevalent. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and various sensors, can also arise. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, these mechanical and electrical components represent the most significant potential reliability challenges for this model year.
