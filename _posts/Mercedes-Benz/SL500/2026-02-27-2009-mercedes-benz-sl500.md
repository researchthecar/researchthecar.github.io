### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz SL500 is a complex luxury vehicle with potential reliability concerns primarily centered around its advanced systems. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the retractable hardtop are known for costly hydraulic leaks and component failures. The 7-speed automatic transmission can also develop issues with its control module and torque converter. Engine-wise, the 5.5L V8 is generally robust, but intake manifold runner flap actuators and oil leaks from gaskets are common. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment and seat controls, can also arise. While not plagued by constant breakdowns, owners should be prepared for significant repair costs associated with these sophisticated features. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining this high-performance convertible.
