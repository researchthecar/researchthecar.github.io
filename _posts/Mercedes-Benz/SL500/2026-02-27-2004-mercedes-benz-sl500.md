### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz SL500 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but its advanced technology, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the Vario-Roof mechanism, are prone to costly repairs. Engine and transmission components are generally robust, but age-related issues like ignition coil failures and conductor plate problems can arise. Electrical gremlins and interior component failures are also not uncommon. Prospective buyers should budget for potential maintenance and repairs, especially concerning the complex hydraulic and electronic systems. Regular servicing by a qualified technician is essential to mitigate these risks and maintain the vehicle's operability and value.
