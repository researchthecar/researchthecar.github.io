The 2007 Mercedes-Benz SL500 is a luxury roadster known for its retractable hardtop, comfortable ride, and elegant styling. It came standard with a 5.0L V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the SL included a 3.5L V6 in the SL350, a 5.5L V8 in the SL550, a supercharged 5.4L V8 in the SL55 AMG, and a 6.0L V12 in the SL600 and SL65 AMG.
