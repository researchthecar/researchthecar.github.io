### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz SL500 is a luxurious and powerful convertible, but like many high-end vehicles, it can present specific reliability concerns. The most notable potential issues lie within the complex Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, where hydraulic leaks and pump failures can be costly to repair. Powertrain components, such as the engine's timing chain and the 7-speed automatic transmission's control module or torque converter, can also require attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are not uncommon. The retractable hardtop mechanism and interior seat/climate control actuators are also areas where repairs may be needed. While not plagued by widespread, catastrophic failures, owners should budget for potential maintenance and repairs, especially concerning the advanced systems that define the SL500's luxury experience.
