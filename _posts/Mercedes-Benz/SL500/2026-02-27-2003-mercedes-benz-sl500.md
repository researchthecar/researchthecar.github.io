### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz SL500 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be prepared for the possibility of significant repair costs, particularly concerning its complex Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the intricate retractable hardtop system. Electrical gremlins, especially with the COMAND system and various sensors, are also common. While the 5.0L V8 engine itself is generally robust, associated components like ignition coils and oil cooler seals can require attention. The 5-speed automatic transmission is relatively reliable, but issues with the TCM or conductor plate can arise. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a budget for potential repairs are highly recommended for this model.
