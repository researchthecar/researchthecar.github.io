### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz SL500 offers a luxurious driving experience but comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly related to its complex Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the retractable hardtop system. These sophisticated systems, while impressive, are prone to hydraulic leaks and component failures that can lead to significant repair costs. The powertrain, a 5.0L V8 and 5-speed automatic transmission, is generally robust but can experience issues with oil cooler seals, tensioners, and the transmission's conductor plate. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster display problems and headlight ballast failures, are also noted. While not a maintenance-free vehicle, addressing these common issues proactively can help maintain the SL500's performance and luxury.
