### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz SL500 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but its advanced technology, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the retractable hardtop, can be sources of significant repair costs. Engine and transmission reliability are generally good for the powertrain itself, but associated components like ignition coils and conductor plates can fail. Electrical gremlins, especially within the COMAND system and various control modules, are also common. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair bills, with a strong emphasis on specialized knowledge for servicing the complex hydraulic and electronic systems. Regular, diligent maintenance by a qualified technician is paramount to mitigating these potential issues and enjoying the SL500's capabilities.
