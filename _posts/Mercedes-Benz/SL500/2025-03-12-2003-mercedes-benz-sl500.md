The 2003 Mercedes-Benz SL500 is a luxurious roadster known for its retractable hardtop, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. The standard engine is a 5.0L V8 producing 302 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. A smaller 3.7L V6 was also available for the SL350, and a larger 5.4L V8 for the SL55 AMG. All engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car's elegant styling, robust performance, and comfortable interior. Downsides frequently mentioned include the complexity of the electro-hydraulic systems, potential for costly repairs, and the car's age, which can lead to increased maintenance needs.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets, leading to a burning smell and potential oil loss.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500

* **Harmonic Balancer Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The harmonic balancer (crankshaft pulley) can separate, causing vibration, noise, and potential damage to the engine.
    * Solution: Replace the harmonic balancer.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

* **MAF Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running, stalling, poor fuel economy, check engine light with codes related to the MAF sensor.
    * Solution: Replace the MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Conductor Plate Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, getting stuck in gear, transmission slipping, limp mode. Often accompanied by transmission fault codes.
    * Solution: Replace the conductor plate within the transmission. This may also require a new transmission fluid filter and gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks**

    * Solution: Diagnosis is critical. Potential solutions include replacing ABC accumulators/pulsation dampeners, hydraulic lines, the ABC pump, or even the ABC struts. A full system flush and filter change can sometimes help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the component that has failed)

* **ABC Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Leaking hydraulic fluid from struts, knocking noises, sagging suspension.
