### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz SL500 is a high-performance luxury vehicle with a generally solid reliability record, but it is not without its potential issues. Owners should be aware of possible problems with the sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, particularly hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. The powertrain, while robust, can experience issues like timing chain wear on the V8 engine and occasional transmission control module or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. The complex retractable hardtop mechanism can also require attention. Despite these potential concerns, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs, the SL500 can provide a rewarding ownership experience.
