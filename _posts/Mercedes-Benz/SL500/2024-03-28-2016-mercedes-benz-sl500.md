Drivers appreciate the SL500's exceptional performance, comfortable interior, and stylish design. However, it also comes with some potential issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**4.7L V8**

* **Camshaft Adjuster Failure:** The camshaft adjuster may fail, causing timing issues and reduced engine performance. Symptoms include engine noise, decreased power, and illuminated check engine light. Solution: Replacement of the camshaft adjuster and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **Valvetronic System Malfunction:** The Valvetronic system, which controls valve lift, may malfunction due to sensor or solenoid issues. Symptoms include rough idle, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. Solution: Replacement of faulty sensors or solenoids. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**4.7L V8 Biturbo (SL63)**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** Turbochargers can fail due to excessive heat or oil starvation. Symptoms include loss of power, smoke from the exhaust, and audible noises. Solution: Replacement of the affected turbocharger. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ per turbocharger
* **Intercooler Leakage:** The intercooler, which cools the air from the turbochargers, may develop leaks. Symptoms include reduced engine performance and increased intake air temperatures. Solution: Repair or replacement of the intercooler. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**6.3L V12 (SL65)**

* **Engine Overheating:** The massive V12 engine can generate excessive heat, leading to overheating issues. Symptoms include high coolant temperatures and reduced engine performance. Solution: Inspection and repair of the cooling system, including replacement of leaking components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
* **Transmission Failure:** The 7-speed automatic transmission can fail due to overheating or torque converter issues. Symptoms include difficulty shifting, slipping gears, and loss of power. Solution: Transmission repair or replacement. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Issues:** The torque converter may fail, leading to slipping gears, shuddering during acceleration, and loss of power. Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Shift solenoids may fail, causing erratic or delayed shifting. Symptoms include difficulty changing gears and illuminated check engine light. Solution: Replacement of faulty shift solenoids. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Malfunction:** The air suspension system may experience leaks, compressor failure, or sensor issues. Symptoms include uneven ride height, reduced handling, and illuminated suspension warning light. Solution: Inspection and repair or replacement of affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery may drain prematurely due to parasitic current draw. Symptoms include difficulty starting the vehicle and frequent battery replacement. Solution: Identification and elimination of electrical current draw. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **BCM Failure:** The body control module (BCM) may fail, affecting multiple electrical systems. Symptoms include inoperative lights, locks, and windows. Solution: Replacement of the BCM. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+

**Exterior**

* **Convertible Top Issues:** The convertible top may experience leaks, misalignment, or failure of the hydraulic system. Symptoms include water ingress, wind noise, and difficulty opening or closing the top. Solution: Repair or replacement of affected components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Interior**

* **Instrument Cluster Failure:** The instrument cluster may experience pixelation or total failure. Symptoms include distorted or blank display. Solution: Replacement of the instrument cluster. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Heater Core Leakage:** The heater core may develop leaks, causing coolant to leak into the cabin. Symptoms include fogging of the windshield and a sweet smell in the cabin. Solution: Replacement of the heater core. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Recalls:**

* **NHTSA Recall 19V-102:** Rear suspension upper control arm fracture
* **NHTSA Recall 19V-428:** Throttle body sensor failure

**Summary**

While the 2016 Mercedes-Benz SL500 offers impressive performance and luxury, it also has some potential issues that can be costly to repair. Engine problems, particularly with the camshaft adjuster and Valvetronic system, are common. The transmission may also experience torque converter or shift solenoid failure. Suspension and electrical issues can be expensive to resolve, especially air suspension malfunctions and BCM failures. Interior problems are less severe but can still add up, such as instrument cluster failure and heater core leakage. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in the potential cost of repairs before purchasing.
