### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mercedes-Benz SL500 is a highly capable luxury convertible with a generally strong reliability record. The powertrain (4.7L V8 engine and 9-speed automatic transmission) is robust and rarely presents widespread issues. However, potential buyers should be aware of the complexity of the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, which can be prone to hydraulic leaks and sensor issues, leading to potentially significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. The retractable hardtop mechanism, while generally reliable, can require maintenance. Overall, the SL500 offers a luxurious and powerful driving experience, but its advanced systems necessitate diligent maintenance and a budget for potential repairs, especially for components outside the core powertrain.
