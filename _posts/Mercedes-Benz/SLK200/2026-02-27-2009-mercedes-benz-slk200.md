### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz SLK200 is a generally reliable roadster, but potential owners should be aware of specific common issues. The engine's timing chain tensioner is a notable concern that can lead to significant repair costs if not addressed proactively. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the SAM unit and headlight ballasts, can also arise. The complex retractable hardtop mechanism is another area where hydraulic issues or sensor malfunctions can occur, impacting the car's primary appeal. While the transmission and suspension are typically robust, the engine and electrical systems warrant careful inspection and maintenance history review.
