The 2013 Mercedes-Benz SLK200 is a stylish and sporty roadster known for its retractable hardtop, offering the versatility of both a coupe and a convertible. In addition to the SLK200 with its 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing around 184 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, other engine options available for the 2013 SLK range included the SLK250 (similar 1.8L but tuned for higher output), the SLK350 (3.5L V6), and the high-performance SLK55 AMG (5.5L V8). All variants typically came with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the SLK's refined driving experience, comfortable interior, and iconic design. Common dislikes often revolve around the somewhat cramped interior space and potential maintenance costs associated with a luxury vehicle.
