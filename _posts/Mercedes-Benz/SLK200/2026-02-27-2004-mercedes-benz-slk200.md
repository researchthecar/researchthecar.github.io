### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz SLK200 (R171) offers a compelling blend of style and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of common reliability concerns. The 1.8L supercharged engine, while generally robust, is prone to timing chain issues and supercharger belt wear. The 5G-Tronic automatic transmission can develop leaks or solenoid problems. The retractable hardtop system is a significant feature but can be a source of costly repairs due to hydraulic leaks or sensor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and keyless entry systems, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear over time. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to early warning signs, the SLK200 can remain a rewarding and enjoyable sports car.
