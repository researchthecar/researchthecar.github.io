### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz SLK200 (R170) is a stylish roadster that, while offering a premium experience, requires attention to potential age-related issues. The 2.0L Kompressor engine is generally robust but can suffer from belt wear and MAF sensor problems. Automatic transmission issues, particularly with the TCM and solenoids, are a notable concern. The retractable hardtop system is a complex feature prone to hydraulic leaks or pump failures, which can be costly to repair.
