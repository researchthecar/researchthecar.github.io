The 2012 Mercedes-Benz SLK200 is a stylish and compact roadster known for its retractable hardtop, providing open-air driving enjoyment with the security of a coupe. The SLK200 is equipped with a 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 184 horsepower and 270 Nm of torque. Other engine options available include the SLK250 (1.8-liter turbo four-cylinder with higher output), the SLK350 (3.5-liter V6), and the SLK55 AMG (5.5-liter V8). Transmission choices typically include a 6-speed manual (less common) or a 7-speed automatic (7G-TRONIC PLUS). Drivers often praise the SLK200 for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and elegant design. However, some criticize its relatively small interior space and occasional maintenance costs associated with luxury vehicles.
