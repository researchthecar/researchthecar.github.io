### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE350 is a generally reliable luxury SUV, particularly in its powertrain. The naturally aspirated 3.5L V6 engine is robust, though owners should be aware of potential coolant and oil leaks, which are typically manageable repairs. The 7-speed automatic transmission is also solid, but occasional issues with shuddering or control module failures can arise, often requiring software updates or component replacement. Optional air suspension systems, while providing excellent comfort, are more prone to leaks and compressor issues than standard suspension. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted but not overwhelmingly common. Overall, the GLE350 offers good reliability for its class, with most potential issues being repairable and not indicative of fundamental design flaws.
