### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE350 is generally a reliable luxury SUV, with its core powertrain components (3.5L V6 engine and 7-speed automatic transmission) demonstrating strong durability. The most commonly cited non-wear-and-tear issues tend to be related to the optional Airmatic suspension, where leaks or compressor failures can occur. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and LED headlights, are also noted, often requiring software updates or module replacements. Interior components like leather upholstery can show premature wear, and the HVAC blower motor is another potential point of failure. Overall, while not immune to issues, the GLE350 offers a respectable reliability record for its class, with most problems being repairable, albeit at a premium cost typical of luxury vehicles.
