**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (GLE350)**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report engine misfires, rough idling, and/or the check engine light illuminating. This can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using an OBD-II scanner to identify the affected cylinder(s) is the first step. Replacement of faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ (depending on the component needing replacement and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported oil leaks originating from various engine seals, such as the valve cover gasket or the oil pan gasket. Symptoms may include visible oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the leak. Replace the faulty gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the location of the leak and the extent of disassembly required)
