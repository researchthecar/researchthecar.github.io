The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE350 marked a significant redesign of the popular SUV. The GLE350 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 255 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Other available engine options for the 2019 GLE included a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbo (GLE450) and a 4.0-liter V8 biturbo (GLE580 and AMG variants). Owners often praise the GLE for its luxurious interior, comfortable ride, and advanced technology features. However, some common complaints include the complex infotainment system, occasional electronic glitches, and higher maintenance costs.
