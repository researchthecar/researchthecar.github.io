### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz CL200 (CLK200 Kompressor) is a capable coupe with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The 2.0L supercharged engine is relatively reliable, though common issues like MAF sensor and ignition coil failures can occur. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while robust, can develop issues with its control module or valve body over time, which can be costly to repair. Suspension components, particularly bushings, are prone to wear, leading to typical handling and noise issues. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or window regulators, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior wear on seats is typical. Overall, while not immune to problems, many issues are age-related and manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
