### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz CL200 (C200 Kompressor) demonstrates a generally solid mechanical foundation, with the 2.0L supercharged engine being a robust unit. However, common points of attention include the supercharger belt, MAF sensor, and potential coolant leaks, which are not uncommon for vehicles of this age and complexity. The 5G-Tronic automatic transmission, while generally reliable, can experience issues with its control module or valve body, leading to significant repair costs. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also wear items that may require replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and window regulators, are noted. Overall, the CL200 offers a premium experience, but owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with its advanced systems and luxury appointments, especially concerning the transmission and electrical components.
