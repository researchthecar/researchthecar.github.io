The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Viano BRT (likely a typo for "Viano" or a specific configuration) is a large passenger van, offering space and versatility. Commonly equipped with a diesel engine, it prioritizes fuel efficiency and torque for hauling passengers and cargo. Specific engine options for the 2016 Viano vary depending on the market but could include variants of the 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel (OM651) or the 3.0-liter V6 diesel (OM642). Power outputs typically ranged from around 136 hp to 190 hp for the 2.1L and around 224 hp for the 3.0L. Torque figures are more important for a van, with the 2.1L producing around 330-440 Nm and the 3.0L around 440 Nm. Owners often praise the Viano for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and Mercedes-Benz build quality. Common complaints often revolve around higher running costs, occasional electrical issues, and potentially expensive repairs.

**Engine**

**2.1L Four-Cylinder Diesel (OM651)**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, excessive smoke (black or white), and the engine management light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) using diagnostic equipment and replace the failed units. Recoding the injectors to the ECU may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ per injector depending on labor and part cost.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup, can indicate a stretched or worn timing chain. Can lead to serious engine damage if ignored.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6 Diesel (OM642)**

*   **Oil Cooler Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the oil cooler located in the V of the engine, often manifesting as oil drips or a strong burning oil smell. Can be difficult to access.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler seals or the entire oil cooler assembly. This is a labor-intensive job.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Swirl Flap Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, especially at lower RPMs, check engine light. The swirl flaps in the intake manifold can become clogged with carbon deposits, causing the motor to fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the swirl flap motor and potentially clean the intake manifold. Some owners opt to delete the swirl flaps entirely, but this may affect emissions and is not legal in all regions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9) Automatic Transmission (Common to both engine options)**

*   **Torque Converter Lock-Up Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during gear changes, particularly when the torque converter locks up at higher speeds. Can also cause a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the torque converter. Flushing the transmission fluid regularly can help prevent this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ depending on whether it's a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. The valve body controls the flow of hydraulic fluid within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Sometimes, cleaning the valve body and replacing solenoids can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, compressor running constantly, "Visit Workshop" message related to suspension. Leaks in the air struts or lines, compressor failure, or issues with the control module can cause these problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the leak and replace the faulty components (struts, lines, compressor).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per strut, $500 - $1500+ for the compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Issues (Power Sliding Doors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors failing to open or close correctly, getting stuck, or making unusual noises. Problems can stem from the motor, wiring harness, or sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the fault using diagnostic equipment. Replace the faulty motor, wiring harness, or sensors. Lubricating the door tracks can also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems affecting various systems, such as lights, wipers, or windows. The SAM module controls and distributes power to various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty SAM module and reprogram it to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Tailgate/Rear Hatch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust or corrosion forming around the edges of the tailgate/rear hatch, particularly near the license plate lights or hinges.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust, treat the affected area with rust inhibitor, and repaint. In severe cases, the entire tailgate/hatch may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on severity and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Center Console Screen/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezing, blacking out, or displaying error messages. Can also affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.

**Summary**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Viano BRT can offer a comfortable and spacious ride, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the diesel engines and transmission. Engine issues, such as injector or swirl flap failures, and transmission problems with the valve body can be expensive to repair. Electrical problems and air suspension issues (if equipped) can also add to the cost of ownership. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are crucial before purchasing a used Viano BRT. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars.
