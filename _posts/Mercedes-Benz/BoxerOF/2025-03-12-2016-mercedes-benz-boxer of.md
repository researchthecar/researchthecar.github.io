The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Boxer OF is a commercial bus chassis designed for various body configurations, primarily used for passenger transportation. It typically features a robust build quality and is known for its reliability and durability in demanding applications. Engine options commonly include diesel variants, such as the OM 934 LA, a 5.1-liter inline-four cylinder diesel engine, producing around 170-210 horsepower and a torque output of 516-664 lb-ft depending on the exact configuration. Available transmissions are typically automatic or automated manual transmissions. Common praises include its robust construction and suitability for heavy-duty use, while complaints often revolve around maintenance costs and specific component failures due to the high-stress environment in which these vehicles operate.

**Engine**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inadequate heating or cooling, uneven temperature distribution, and unusual noises from the HVAC system. Could be caused by a faulty blower motor, compressor, or refrigerant leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+, depending on the specific issue and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Boxer OF, while generally a reliable platform, can experience issues related to its engine (fuel injectors, turbocharger), transmission (shifting problems), suspension (air suspension issues), electrical system (wiring and sensor failures), and body (corrosion). The severity and cost of these repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue, ranging from a few hundred dollars for sensor replacements to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission overhauls. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs associated with commercial vehicles.
