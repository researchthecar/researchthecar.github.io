The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Boxer OF is a commercial vehicle chassis primarily used for building buses and coaches. Engine options typically included diesel engines, with the OM 926 LA being a common choice. This engine is a 7.2-liter inline-6, producing around 286 horsepower and substantial torque for hauling passengers. Known for its reliability and fuel efficiency, the Boxer OF is liked for its robust build and suitability for demanding transit applications. However, some common complaints revolve around parts availability and repair costs associated with a European commercial vehicle in some markets, and the ride quality due to its heavy-duty suspension. Transmission options vary depending on the specific configuration, but typically include automatic and manual transmissions.

**Engine**

**OM 926 LA (7.2L Diesel)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector, depending on labor and parts availability.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black or blue smoke, whining noise from the turbo, and potential engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+ depending on if you rebuild or replace the whole unit.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, rough idle, increased emissions, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison Automatic Transmission (Specific Model Dependent on Configuration)**

*   **Slipping or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips during acceleration, delayed or harsh shifts, and potential inability to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: This could be due to a number of issues inside the transmission. Start by replacing the transmission fluid, filter, and resetting the transmission adaptation tables. If this does not fix the issue, further inspection of the valve body, solenoids, or internal components is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for fluid and filter change. $800 - $4000+ for more in-depth repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, and abnormal noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leaks, often noticed as red fluid puddles under the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak (seals, gaskets, or cooler lines).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity and source of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension System Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, compressor running constantly, and a hissing sound from the air suspension components.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair or replace the leaking air springs, lines, or compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ per air spring or compressor replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shocks or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights on the dashboard, including ABS, traction control, or engine management lights. Specific symptoms depend on the failed sensor (e.g., erratic speedometer reading due to a faulty wheel speed sensor).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor failure and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor depending on location and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, starting problems, or sensor malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Inspect the wiring harness for damage or corrosion, and repair or replace damaged sections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Cold Climates)**

**Summary**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Boxer OF can be a reliable workhorse but owners should be aware of some potential issues. Engine issues such as fuel injector and turbocharger failures can be costly, and transmission problems, especially with the automatic transmissions, can also be expensive to repair. Suspension and electrical problems can also add to the maintenance costs. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite severe. Overall, potential owners should factor in the potential for relatively high maintenance costs associated with a heavy-duty commercial vehicle, especially concerning the diesel engine and complex electrical systems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any issues can help to mitigate these problems.
