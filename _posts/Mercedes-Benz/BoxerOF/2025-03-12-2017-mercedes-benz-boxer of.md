The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer OF is not a Mercedes-Benz model designation, assuming you mean the Sprinter commercial van) is a popular choice for commercial use and camper van conversions, known for its reliability, spaciousness, and fuel efficiency. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. Engine options for the 2017 Sprinter include a 2.1L inline-4 diesel (OM651) producing around 161 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 diesel (OM642) delivering approximately 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC PLUS). Owners often praise the Sprinter's cargo capacity and driving comfort, while common complaints revolve around the cost of maintenance and repairs.
