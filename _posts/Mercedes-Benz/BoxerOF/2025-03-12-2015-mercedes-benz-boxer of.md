The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer OF refers to the chassis designation and is not typically how it is referenced) is a popular van used for commercial and recreational purposes. Engine options include a 2.1L four-cylinder diesel (OM651) producing approximately 161 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 diesel (OM642) rated around 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. These engines are generally appreciated for their fuel efficiency and reliability (relative to gasoline alternatives) while some owners find the power of the four-cylinder adequate but the V6 preferred for heavier loads or hilly terrain. Common complaints often revolve around the cost of maintenance and repairs, especially with complex emission control systems.
