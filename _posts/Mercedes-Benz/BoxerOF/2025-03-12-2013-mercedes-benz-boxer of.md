The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (also known as the "Boxer OF" in some markets) is a popular commercial van praised for its versatility, spaciousness, and fuel efficiency. The 2013 Sprinter offered a range of configurations including cargo vans, passenger vans, and chassis cabs. Engine options commonly included a 2.1L inline-4 turbo diesel (OM651) producing around 161 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 3.0L V6 turbo diesel (OM642) producing around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission (NAG5) or a 7-speed automatic transmission (NAG2, depending on the specific model and year). Owners often appreciate the Sprinter's high roof option for increased cargo space and the smooth ride quality. However, potential downsides can include higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors and potential issues with certain emissions control systems.

**Summary**

The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, while a capable and popular van, is prone to a range of issues, particularly concerning its diesel engines and transmission systems. Engine problems like oil cooler leaks, swirl motor failures (V6), injector issues, and timing chain concerns (I4) can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission issues, especially valve body problems with the 7-speed, can also be expensive. Suspension and electrical problems add to the potential maintenance burden. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in higher-than-average maintenance costs when considering this vehicle. The severity ranges from nuisance electrical issues to major engine and transmission repairs, with costs varying accordingly from a few hundred dollars to several thousand for major repairs.
