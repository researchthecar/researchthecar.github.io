The 2014 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer OF refers to the body style, not a specific model name) is a popular choice for commercial use, known for its versatility and cargo capacity. Engine options typically include a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel, a 3.0-liter V6 diesel, and a 3.5-liter V6 gasoline engine. The diesel engines are praised for their fuel efficiency and torque, making them suitable for hauling heavy loads. The 2.1L 4-cylinder makes around 161 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0L V6 makes around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. However, some owners report issues with reliability and maintenance costs. The gasoline engines are praised for their power but are less fuel efficient. Common complaints revolve around electrical issues, diesel emissions systems, and the overall cost of ownership. The Sprinter typically uses a 5-speed or 7-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine.
