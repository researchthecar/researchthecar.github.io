The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer OF likely refers to a specific configuration or upfit of the Sprinter van) is a popular choice for commercial use and camper van conversions, known for its versatility and reliability. While specific configurations like the "Boxer OF" may have unique upfit-related issues, the underlying Sprinter platform has common problem areas. Engine options for the 2021 Sprinter include a 2.0L Turbocharged 4-cylinder diesel (around 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L Turbocharged V6 diesel (around 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque). The 2.0L gasoline engine (around 188 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque) is also available. All engines are typically paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sprinter's spacious interior and payload capacity, but some dislike its relatively high price point and potential maintenance costs.

**Summary**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, while generally reliable, does have some common issues. Diesel engines, particularly the V6, can be prone to oil cooler leaks and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as rough shifting, are also reported. Electrical gremlins, sensor failures, and suspension issues, especially with heavy upfits, are other areas to be aware of. Overall, while some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, others can run into the thousands of dollars, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect a used Sprinter and consider a pre-purchase inspection.
