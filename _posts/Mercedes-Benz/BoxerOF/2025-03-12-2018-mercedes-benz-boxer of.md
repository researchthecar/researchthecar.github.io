The 2018 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer OF is not a valid Mercedes-Benz model. Assuming this is a Sprinter sold as a chassis cab for upfitting, specifically the NCV3 chassis), is a popular choice for commercial and recreational vehicle applications. It offers a blend of reliability, versatility, and Mercedes-Benz refinement. The 2018 model year offers several engine options including the 2.1L inline-4 turbo diesel (OM651) producing around 161 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.0L V6 turbo diesel (OM642) which puts out around 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). Owners often praise the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride (especially with upgraded suspension), and relatively fuel-efficient diesel engines. Common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs, some electrical quirks, and the initial purchase price compared to other vans in its class.
