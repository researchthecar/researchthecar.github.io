It appears there is a misunderstanding, as the "Mercedes-Benz Toreto 48" is not a real vehicle model produced by Mercedes-Benz. To provide accurate and helpful information, I need a valid Mercedes-Benz model and year.

For example, if you meant the Mercedes-AMG GT 43 4-Door Coupe, which is a real model, I can provide information based on common issues reported for that vehicle. Please provide the correct make and model so I can give you accurate information in the requested format.
