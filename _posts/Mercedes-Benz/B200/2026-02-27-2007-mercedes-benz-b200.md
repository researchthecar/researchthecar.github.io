### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz B200 presents a mixed reliability profile. The petrol engines are generally robust but can suffer from oil leaks and ignition coil issues. Diesel variants are more prone to DPF and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions may develop shifting issues over time, while manual clutches are subject to normal wear. Suspension components like bushings and strut mounts are common wear items that can lead to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and sensors, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, specific component failures can occur. Overall, the B200 requires diligent maintenance, and potential buyers should be aware of these common issues, especially when considering higher-mileage examples.
