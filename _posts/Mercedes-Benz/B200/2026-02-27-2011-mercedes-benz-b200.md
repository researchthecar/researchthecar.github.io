### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz B200 offers a blend of luxury and practicality, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The petrol engines, particularly the turbocharged 1.8L M271, can experience timing chain and turbocharger issues. The dual-clutch and CVT transmissions, while offering efficiency, are prone to mechatronic unit or belt/pulley problems respectively. Suspension components like strut mounts and control arm bushings may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and sensor failures, are also noted. Interior comfort features like HVAC blowers and seat heaters can also develop faults. While many B200s perform reliably, proactive maintenance and awareness of these common issues are recommended to mitigate potential repair costs and ensure a positive ownership experience.
