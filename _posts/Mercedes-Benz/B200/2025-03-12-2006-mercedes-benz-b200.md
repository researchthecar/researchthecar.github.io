The 2006 Mercedes-Benz B200 is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and relatively comfortable ride. In addition to the standard B200 with a 2.0L inline-4 engine (136 hp, 136 lb-ft of torque), the B200 Turbo was also available, featuring a turbocharged version of the same 2.0L engine (193 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the B200 for its practicality and fuel economy, but some common complaints include issues with the CVT transmission, electrical problems, and some engine-related concerns.
