### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz B200 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the exterior and general cabin are relatively robust, potential owners should be mindful of specific powertrain and electrical components. Engine issues like oil leaks and PCV clogging are common, with turbocharged variants facing potential turbocharger problems. Transmissions, particularly the CVT, can experience shuddering and leaks, requiring significant repair costs. Suspension components such as control arm bushings and strut mounts may require attention. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or sensors, can also arise. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring a more reliable ownership experience.
