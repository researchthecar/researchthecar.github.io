### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz B200 offers a practical and comfortable experience, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The petrol engine can suffer from camshaft wear and oil leaks, while the diesel variant may encounter turbocharger problems. Transmission reliability, particularly with the CVT, is a notable concern, with slipping and valve body issues being reported. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and sensor failures, are also present. While not inherently unreliable, addressing these potential issues proactively through diligent maintenance and inspection is recommended for owners of the 2006 B200.
