The 2007 Mercedes-Benz B200 is a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. In North America, it was only available with a 2.0L inline-4 gasoline engine (M266) producing around 134 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often appreciate the B200's spacious interior and comfortable ride, but some dislike its somewhat bland styling and occasionally quirky CVT performance.

**Engine**

**2.0L Inline-4 (M266)**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may exhibit rough idling, poor performance, and the check engine light may illuminate with codes related to camshaft timing. This can be caused by a faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations, including the valve cover gasket and timing chain cover. Visible oil leaks and a burning smell are common symptoms.
