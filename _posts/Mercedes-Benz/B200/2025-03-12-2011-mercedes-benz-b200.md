The 2011 Mercedes-Benz B200 is a compact multi-purpose vehicle known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. While not known for blistering performance, the 2011 B200 with its 2.0L inline-4 gasoline engine (136 horsepower, 155 lb-ft of torque) provides adequate power for city driving and comfortable cruising. Other engine options available were a 1.5L and 1.7L gasoline inline-4 cylinder. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) was the primary transmission. Owners generally appreciate its spacious interior and elevated seating position, which provides good visibility. However, some dislike its somewhat bland styling and occasional reliability issues.
