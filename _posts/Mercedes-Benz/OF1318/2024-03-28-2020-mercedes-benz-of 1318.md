The OF 1318 is praised for its powerful engines, sturdy construction, and comfortable cabin. However, it has been reported to have several issues.

**Engine**

**7.2-liter OM 926 LA Inline-6 Diesel Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail prematurely, resulting in a loss of power and black smoke from the exhaust pipe. The solution is to replace the turbocharger, which costs around $2,000 to $3,000.
* **Fuel Injector Issues:** The fuel injectors can become clogged or fail, causing rough idling, poor fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust pipe. The solution is to replace the fuel injectors, which costs around $500 to $1,000.

**11.0-liter OM 460 LA Inline-6 Diesel Engine**

* **EGR Cooler Failure:** The EGR cooler can fail, causing the engine to overheat. The solution is to replace the EGR cooler, which costs around $1,500 to $2,000.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Gear Grinding:** The gears can grind when shifting, especially when the transmission is cold. The solution is to replace the synchronizers, which costs around $500 to $1,000.

**8-Speed Allison Automatic Transmission**

* **Shifting Problems:** The transmission may hesitate or slip when shifting gears. The solution is to replace the transmission solenoid pack, which costs around $1,000 to $1,500.
