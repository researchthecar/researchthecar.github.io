The 2007 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG is a high-performance luxury coupe known for its powerful engine and sleek design. While it offers a thrilling driving experience, it is not without its potential problems. The CLS63 AMG is equipped with a 6.2L M156 V8 engine producing 507 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. Other CLS models in 2007 had different engine options. Owners often praise the car's potent performance, luxurious interior, and distinctive styling. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, electrical issues, and suspension problems.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The camshaft adjuster bolts (also known as camshaft sprocket bolts) can shear off. This can cause the engine to run poorly, make rattling noises, or even stall. The broken bolts can cause serious engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft adjuster bolts with updated, stronger bolts. It's recommended to replace all bolts at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on severity of damage and shop rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifters/Hydraulic Compensators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noise, especially at idle or when the engine is cold. This is due to worn or failing valve lifters.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected valve lifters. In severe cases, camshafts may also need replacement if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the number of lifters needing replacement and if camshafts are also involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gaskets**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vacuum leaks, rough idling, reduced power, and potentially triggering the check engine light. The intake manifold gaskets can degrade over time, leading to air leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant consumption, oil contamination in coolant, white smoke from exhaust, overheating. Some early production M156 engines (primarily 2007-early 2008) had issues with head bolts corroding and failing.
    *   Solution: Replace head bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000 (due to the complexity of the job)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, getting stuck in gear, or a complete loss of drive. The valve body contains solenoids and valves that control the flow of transmission fluid. Wear and tear can cause these components to malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some cases, the entire transmission may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or shaking during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Also, transmission slipping, increased fuel consumption, and unusual noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission going into "limp mode," erratic shifting, or failure to shift at all. The conductor plate houses sensors and electronics that control the transmission's operation.
    *   Solution: Replace the conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car sitting low on one side or all corners, the air compressor running constantly, error messages on the dashboard related to the suspension. Air springs, the air compressor, or valve blocks can fail, leading to leaks or inability to maintain the correct ride height.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty components (air springs, compressor, valve blocks, or air lines).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per corner (depending on which component fails). A compressor replacement can be $800-$1500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Key not recognized, inability to start the car, steering lock malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EIS module. The new module will need to be programmed to the car.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with various electrical systems, such as lights, wipers, or power windows. The SAM modules control various electrical functions in the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty SAM module. The new module will need to be programmed to the car.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car is left sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a faulty component that is drawing power even when the car is off.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the battery drain and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the cause. Could range from $100 (for a simple parasitic draw) to several thousand if a more complex module is failing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust on fenders, door bottoms, and other body panels.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels, treat and repaint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per panel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof fails to open or close properly, makes excessive noise, or leaks.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the sunroof motor, tracks, or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Command System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The COMAND system (navigation, radio, climate control interface) freezes, reboots randomly, or has display issues.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the COMAND unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000 (depending on the solution and if replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG, while powerful and luxurious, can suffer from several issues. Engine problems, particularly with the M156 V8, can be expensive to address. Suspension and electrical problems are also relatively common. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in higher than average maintenance costs. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing thousands of dollars. A thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
