The 2011 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG is a high-performance luxury coupe powered by a potent 6.3L naturally aspirated V8 engine that produces 518 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque (or 550 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque with the optional performance package). It is paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (AMG Speedshift MCT 7). Owners typically praise the CLS63 AMG for its stunning design, powerful engine, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior. Common complaints revolve around the high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and occasional reliability issues.

**Engine**

**6.3L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (also known as camshaft position sensor bolts) are prone to failure, especially in earlier production M156 engines. These bolts can break, sending debris into the engine and potentially causing significant damage. Symptoms include a ticking noise, rough running, or a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the original bolts with updated, stronger bolts. This is often done as a preventative measure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on whether it's preventative or after engine damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Bolt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some M156 engines experience head bolt failures, leading to coolant leaks into the cylinders, resulting in misfires, white smoke from the exhaust, and potentially engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the head bolts with updated, stronger bolts and replace the head gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking noise, especially at idle, that seems to come from the top of the engine. This is often due to worn or sticking hydraulic valve lifters.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected valve lifters. In some cases, a full valve job may be recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ depending on the extent of the work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AMG Speedshift MCT 7**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 7-speed MCT transmission can exhibit harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during low-speed maneuvers or when shifting between certain gears. Some owners report hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, it may require valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $300 - $500, Valve body repair/replacement: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can also manifest as rough shifting or a general lack of responsiveness.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (Airmatic)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CLS63 AMG utilizes an Airmatic air suspension system. Common issues include sagging, uneven ride height, compressor failure, and error messages on the dashboard. This can occur due to leaks in the air struts or issues with the compressor.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair or replace the leaking air strut(s) or faulty compressor. Sometimes, the air lines can also leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air strut replacement (each): $1,000 - $2,500+, Compressor replacement: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical gremlins can arise, including issues with the ECU. Symptoms may include stalling, misfires, difficulty starting, or various sensor-related error codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue and repair or replace the faulty ECU or sensors. Sometimes, reprogramming the ECU is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis: $100 - $200, ECU repair/replacement: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster may exhibit dimming, flickering, or complete failure. This can impact the ability to read important vehicle information.
    * Solution: Instrument cluster repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG, while offering exhilarating performance and luxury, can be prone to some expensive repairs. Engine issues, particularly those related to the camshaft adjusters and head bolts, can be very costly. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can still lead to significant expenses. The air suspension is also a known weak point. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of maintenance and repairs when considering purchasing one of these vehicles. Thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
