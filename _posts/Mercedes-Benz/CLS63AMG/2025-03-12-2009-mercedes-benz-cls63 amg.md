The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG is a high-performance luxury coupe known for its striking design and powerful engine. The CLS63 AMG came standard with the 6.2L M156 V8 engine, producing 507 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque, paired with the AMG SPEEDSHIFT 7G-TRONIC seven-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the CLS63 AMG for its blend of luxury, performance, and unique styling. However, some common complaints include high maintenance costs, particularly concerning the engine and suspension.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (also known as cam bolts) are prone to failure. Symptoms include engine ticking noises, loss of power, and potentially catastrophic engine damage if the bolts shear off and enter the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the original camshaft adjuster bolts with the updated version from Mercedes-Benz.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on shop labor rates and any collateral damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter/Hydraulic Tappet Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially at idle, can indicate worn or failing valve lifters (hydraulic tappets). Over time, these can lose their ability to maintain proper valve lash.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty valve lifters. This often involves removing the cylinder heads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (due to extensive labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air leaks around the intake manifold gaskets can cause rough idling, poor performance, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks (Various Locations)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common on the M156 engine, often from the valve cover gaskets, oil cooler lines, or front timing cover. Visible oil leaks and a burning oil smell are typical signs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AMG SPEEDSHIFT 7G-TRONIC (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or transmission slipping can be caused by problems with the valve body. Internal wear or solenoid failure are common causes.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. In some cases, replacing individual solenoids may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling, or unusual noises from the transmission area can indicate torque converter problems.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (including transmission removal and installation)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Airmatic suspension system is prone to failures, including air leaks, compressor failure, and strut failure. Symptoms include the car sitting unevenly, a sagging suspension, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air struts, air compressor, or air lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ per strut; $500 - $1,500+ for the compressor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) Hydraulic Leaks and Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC system can develop hydraulic leaks, leading to a loss of ride height and control. The ABC pump can also fail, resulting in a stiff and uncomfortable ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking hydraulic lines, struts, or the ABC pump. Flushing the system is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can be a common problem. This can be caused by faulty modules not properly going to sleep or parasitic draws from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the drain and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels can fail on the instrument cluster's LCD screen, making it difficult to read information. Complete failure is also possible.
    *   Solution: Replace or repair the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but it is known for its high maintenance costs and potential for expensive repairs. Engine issues, particularly those related to the camshaft adjusters and valve lifters, can be very costly to address. The Airmatic and ABC suspension systems are also prone to failure, adding to the ownership expense. While the vehicle offers a unique driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their budget. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs spanning from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.
