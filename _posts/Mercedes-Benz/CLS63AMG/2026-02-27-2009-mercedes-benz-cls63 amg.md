### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its performance-oriented nature means potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The engine, particularly the M156, can experience timing chain wear and oil leaks, requiring significant investment to address. The AMG SPEEDSHIFT transmission may develop issues with the torque converter or mechatronics unit. The sophisticated Active Body Control suspension is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM unit or Keyless Go system, are also documented. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, the mechanical and electrical components are where most significant reliability concerns lie. Regular, thorough inspections and proactive maintenance by a specialist are crucial for managing ownership costs and ensuring the long-term health of this high-performance AMG.
