### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG offers a compelling blend of luxury and extreme performance. While its core mechanical components, particularly the potent 5.5L twin-turbo V8 and the AMG SPEEDSHIFT transmission, are generally well-engineered, owners should be aware of potential issues related to the complex AIRMATIC suspension system and the sophisticated COMAND infotainment electronics. Turbocharger wastegate actuators and torque converter/mechatronics issues are the most significant powertrain concerns. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment screen glitches and parking sensor malfunctions, are also noted. Despite these potential, albeit not universal, problems, the CLS63 AMG remains a desirable performance sedan when properly maintained, with most repairs being costly due to the specialized nature of AMG components.
