### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz S350 offers a luxurious driving experience, but potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns, particularly with its advanced diesel engine and active suspension system. Issues with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and AdBlue system are common for diesel variants, requiring attention to emissions control. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, while providing exceptional ride quality, can be a source of costly hydraulic leaks and component failures. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment system and parking sensors, can also arise. While the transmission is generally robust, torque converter and valve body issues have been noted. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for maintaining the reliability of this high-end sedan.
