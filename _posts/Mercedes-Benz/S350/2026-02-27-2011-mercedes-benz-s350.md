### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz S350, while a luxurious and comfortable vehicle, presents a mixed reliability profile. The diesel engine, though powerful, is prone to issues with its emissions system (DPF, EGR) and turbocharger, requiring diligent maintenance. The 7G-Tronic transmission can experience problems with its torque converter and valve body. The AirMatic suspension is a common source of costly repairs due to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and various sensors, are also noted. Owners should be prepared for potentially high repair costs associated with these complex systems. Regular and specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these issues and ensuring long-term operation.
