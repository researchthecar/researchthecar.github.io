**Introduction:**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE300d is a mid-size luxury SUV powered by a 2.1L turbocharged diesel engine producing 201 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard with a 7-speed automatic transmission. The GLE300d is praised for its refined ride, spacious interior, and advanced technology, but it has also garnered some complaints regarding its reliability.

**Engine**

* **2.1L Turbocharged Diesel Engine:**
    * **Low Power Output:** Some owners have reported experiencing reduced engine power, often accompanied by a check engine light. The issue is typically caused by a faulty turbocharger.
    * **Engine Stalling:** In some cases, the engine may stall unexpectedly while driving. This problem can be traced to a faulty fuel injector or high-pressure fuel pump.
    **Transmission**

* **7-Speed Automatic Transmission:**
    * **Jerky Shifts:** Several owners have complained about jerky or harsh gear shifts, particularly when accelerating or downshifting. The issue may be caused by a worn-out transmission fluid or a faulty valve body.
    * **Transmission Failure:** In severe cases, the transmission may fail completely, resulting in a loss of power and mobility. This problem often requires a complete transmission replacement.

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension:**
    * **Air Spring Leaks:** The air springs in the air suspension system can develop leaks, leading to a loss of suspension height and a rough ride. Replacing the leaking air springs is necessary.
    * **Valve Block Failure:** A faulty valve block can cause the air suspension system to malfunction, resulting in uneven suspension height or suspension collapse.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Some owners have reported experiencing excessive battery drain, leading to dead batteries and difficulty starting the vehicle. The issue may be caused by a faulty electrical component or a parasitic drain.
    * **Faulty Alternator:** A faulty alternator can fail to charge the battery properly, leading to electrical problems and potential vehicle breakdowns.

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight assemblies, affecting visibility and potentially damaging the headlights. Replacing the affected headlights is necessary.

**Interior**

* **Steering Wheel Controls:** Some owners have reported issues with the steering wheel controls malfunctioning, such as unresponsive buttons or intermittent functionality. Replacing the faulty steering wheel controls is usually required.
    * **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may fail to regulate temperature properly, leading to uncomfortable cabin conditions. A faulty temperature sensor or a malfunctioning control module may be to blame.

**Summary:**

While the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE300d offers a luxurious and comfortable driving experience, it has not been without its share of reliability concerns. The engine and transmission issues can be costly to repair, and the electrical and suspension problems can affect the vehicle's safety and performance. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues vary, so it's essential for potential buyers to consider the potential risks and expenses associated with this vehicle before making a purchase.
