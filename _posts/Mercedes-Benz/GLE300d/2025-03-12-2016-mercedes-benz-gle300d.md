The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class (W166) offered a blend of luxury, performance, and utility. The GLE300d, equipped with a 2.1-liter inline-4 turbodiesel engine, producing 201 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, was designed for fuel efficiency and smooth power delivery. Other engine options available included a 3.5-liter V6, a 3.0-liter biturbo V6, a 4.7-liter biturbo V8, and a 5.5-liter biturbo V8. Transmission options were primarily the 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic and later the 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the GLE for its comfortable ride, upscale interior, and available technology. Common complaints revolved around electronic glitches, higher repair costs compared to other SUVs, and some engine reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE300d offers a refined driving experience but is not without its potential issues. The most concerning problems relate to the diesel engine's emissions system (DPF, EGR) and the transmission, which can lead to expensive repairs. Electrical issues, particularly battery drain and COMAND system glitches, are also relatively common. Suspension issues are prevalent on vehicles equipped with the Airmatic system. Overall, while the GLE300d provides luxury and performance, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the cost of maintenance and repairs, which can be higher than average.
