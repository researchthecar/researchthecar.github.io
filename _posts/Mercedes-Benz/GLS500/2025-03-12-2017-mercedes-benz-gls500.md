The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLS500 (badged GLS550 in the US market) is a full-size luxury SUV, offering a blend of comfort, performance, and technology. The GLS500 is powered by a 4.7-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 449 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the GLS-Class in 2017 included a 3.0-liter V6 in the GLS450 and a high-performance AMG 5.5-liter V8 in the GLS63. All engines are paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the GLS500 for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and powerful engine.
