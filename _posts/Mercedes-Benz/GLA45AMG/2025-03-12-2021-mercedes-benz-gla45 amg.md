The 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA45 AMG is a high-performance subcompact SUV. It's praised for its potent engine, agile handling, and luxurious interior. However, some owners have reported experiencing certain issues. The GLA45 AMG comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 382 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. What owners often dislike is the firm ride, especially on rough roads, and the relatively high price tag for a subcompact SUV.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. The exact cause can vary but sometimes it's related to piston ring issues.
    *   Solution: The solution varies based on the cause of the oil consumption. A compression test can help determine if the piston rings are the source of the problem. If the rings are defective, they will need to be replaced.
