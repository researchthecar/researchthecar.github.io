The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLA45 AMG is a high-performance compact SUV known for its potent engine and sporty handling. While it only came with one engine option, the turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4, which produces 375 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praise its exhilarating acceleration and AMG-tuned suspension, while some find the ride a bit harsh for daily driving and the rear seat space somewhat limited. Common dislikes include a firm ride quality and less than stellar fuel economy compared to its non-AMG counterparts.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M133)**

*   **Coolant Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported coolant loss without any visible leaks. This can be a sign of a failing cylinder head or head gasket.
    *   Solution: Pressure test the cooling system to identify leaks. If no external leaks are found, a combustion leak test should be performed to check for head gasket failure or cylinder head cracks. Replacement of the cylinder head or head gasket might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough idle, extended cranking time when starting, and/or a check engine light with codes related to fuel pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (AMG Speedshift DCT)**

*   **Hesitation/Jerking During Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience hesitation or jerky shifts, especially at low speeds or during aggressive acceleration. This can be caused by issues with the clutch packs or the transmission control module (TCM).
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission adaptation reset. If the issue persists, a transmission fluid flush and filter change might help. In more severe cases, replacement of the clutch packs or the TCM may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (flush) - $5,000+ (clutch pack replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration during acceleration or deceleration, clunking noises when shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission mount.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Sensors (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine lights, various warning messages, and erratic behavior of different systems. This can be due to failing sensors such as oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, or wheel speed sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is failing using a diagnostic scan tool and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not in use. This can be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw using a multimeter and electrical diagrams. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues (Sticking/Failure)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof sticks when opening or closing, makes excessive noise, or fails to operate altogether.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the sunroof tracks and mechanism. If the issue persists, the sunroof motor or regulator may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (lubrication) - $1,000+ (motor/regulator replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking on the dashboard, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement.
