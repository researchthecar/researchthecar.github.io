The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA45 AMG is a performance-oriented subcompact crossover known for its potent turbocharged engine and sporty handling. It's only available with a 2.0L inline-4 turbocharged engine, rated at 355 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT transmission. Drivers appreciate the GLA45 AMG's exhilarating acceleration, nimble handling, and upscale interior. However, some common complaints include a firm ride, limited cargo space, and a relatively high price point.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M133)**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as the "check engine oil level" warning appearing frequently.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks promptly. In some cases, a faulty PCV valve or worn piston rings may be the cause, requiring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the cause (PCV valve vs. piston rings).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises from the turbocharger (whining, screeching), and potential check engine light activation.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger inspection and replacement if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant levels dropping, overheating, visible coolant leaks under the vehicle, and potential check engine light activation.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak (water pump, hoses, radiator) and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT (Dual-Clutch Transmission)**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or abrupt shifts, particularly at low speeds, or during gear changes while accelerating or decelerating.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and adaptation reset may improve shifting quality. In some cases, valve body issues or clutch wear may require more extensive repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+ depending on the issue (fluid flush vs. valve body replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving without corresponding acceleration, delayed engagement of gears, or a feeling of the transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Inspect transmission fluid level and condition. If slippage persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car is hard to start or won't start at all, especially after sitting for a few days. Repeatedly needing to jump-start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw by testing current draw while the car is off and pulling fuses. The common causes are the aftermarket installed alarms, other aftermarket accessories, or a faulty control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light activation, inaccurate readings from sensors (e.g., oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensor), and related performance issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Malfunctioning Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: System freezes, crashes, or exhibits unresponsive behavior. Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation problems, or distorted audio.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In other cases, the head unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ (Software update vs. Head Unit Replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof not opening or closing properly, making grinding noises, or leaking.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the sunroof mechanism, track, and motor. Repair or replacement of damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA45 AMG, while exciting to drive, can present owners with a range of potential issues. Engine problems like excessive oil consumption and turbocharger failures can be costly. Transmission issues, particularly with the dual-clutch system, are also a concern. Electrical and interior issues add to the potential ownership costs. The severity of these issues varies, but some repairs can be significant, leading to higher long-term ownership expenses.
