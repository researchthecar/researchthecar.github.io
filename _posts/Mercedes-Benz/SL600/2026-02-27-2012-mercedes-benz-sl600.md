### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz SL600, while a luxurious and powerful vehicle, exhibits some common issues associated with high-performance, complex luxury cars. The V12 engine, though potent, can be prone to ignition coil and turbocharger problems, and the sophisticated Active Body Control suspension requires diligent maintenance to prevent costly hydraulic leaks. Transmission issues, particularly with the control module and torque converter, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment and sensor systems, can arise. The retractable hardtop mechanism, a hallmark of the SL, may require attention over time. Despite these potential concerns, many owners find the SL600 to be a rewarding ownership experience when properly maintained, with most issues being repairable, albeit at a premium cost reflective of its luxury status.
