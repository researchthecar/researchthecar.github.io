### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz SL600 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but its advanced technology, particularly the V12 engine and Active Body Control suspension, can lead to significant repair costs if issues arise. Common concerns include ABC system leaks and pump failures, ignition coil and turbocharger problems on the V12, and occasional transmission control module or valve body issues. Electrical gremlins and retractable hardtop mechanism problems are also noted. While not plagued by widespread, catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair bills, especially for the complex hydraulic and powertrain systems. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these risks.
