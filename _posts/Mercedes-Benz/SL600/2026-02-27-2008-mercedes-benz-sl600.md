### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz SL600 is a complex luxury vehicle where potential reliability issues are often tied to its advanced V12 engine, sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, and intricate retractable hardtop. While the core powertrain is robust, specific components like ignition coils and turbochargers can require attention. The ABC system, in particular, is known for potential hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, especially within the COMAND infotainment system and various sensors, are also noted. Owners should be prepared for higher maintenance and repair costs compared to less complex vehicles, and regular, specialized servicing is crucial for maintaining its performance and reliability.
