The 2001 Mercedes-Benz SL600 is a luxurious roadster boasting a powerful V12 engine. Other engine options for the 2001 SL included the SL500 with a 5.0L V8 and the SL320 with a 3.2L V6. All models were equipped with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The SL600's 6.0L V12 produces 389 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the car's smooth ride, powerful engine, and luxurious features. Common complaints revolve around the complexity of the systems, leading to potentially high maintenance and repair costs.

**Engine**

**6.0L M120 V12**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common as the engine ages. Leaks can originate from valve cover gaskets, timing cover gaskets, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, low oil level, and burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.

* **Ignition Coil Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The M120 engine uses two distributors and two ignition coils. Individual coils can fail leading to misfires, rough running, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil. It is recommended to replace both coils as preventative maintenance.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400 per coil (parts and labor).

* **Cooling System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Overheating can be caused by radiator leaks, failing water pump, or a faulty thermostat.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

* **Slipping and Erratic Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 722.6 transmission can experience slipping between gears, harsh shifting, or failure to shift properly. This can be caused by low fluid, worn valve body components, or internal damage.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission service including fluid and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. Major transmission overhaul or replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 for fluid and filter change, $500 - $1500 for valve body repair/replacement, $2,000 - $5,000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.

* **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate houses the transmission's electronic control unit and sensors. Failure can lead to erratic shifting, limp mode, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the conductor plate and potentially the valve body.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

* **Hydraulic Suspension Issues (ADS - Adaptive Damping System)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The hydraulic suspension system is complex and prone to leaks and failures. Symptoms include uneven ride height, suspension warning lights, and a harsh ride. Accumulators are a common failure point.
    * Solution: Identify and repair leaks in the hydraulic lines and components. Replace faulty accumulators, struts, or the hydraulic pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per strut/accumulator, $1,000 - $3,000+ for pump replacement.

* **Suspension Accumulator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Suspension accumulators provide a smooth ride. When they fail, the ride becomes harsh and bouncy.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty accumulators.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per accumulator

**Electrical**

* **Convertible Top Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The convertible top system is complex and relies on hydraulic cylinders, sensors, and a control module. Failures can result in the top not opening or closing properly, getting stuck, or displaying error messages. Leaks in the hydraulic cylinders are common.
    * Solution: Diagnose the fault using a Mercedes-Benz diagnostic tool. Repair or replace faulty sensors, hydraulic cylinders, or the control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the component. Cylinder replacement can be $500 - $1000+ each, while a control module can be significantly more.

* **Instrument Cluster Pixelation**
    * Description/Symptoms: The LCD screens in the instrument cluster can suffer from pixel loss, making it difficult to read information.
    * Solution: Replace the instrument cluster or repair the LCD screen.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+

* **Central Locking System Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: The central locking system can fail, preventing doors from locking or unlocking with the remote or key. This can be caused by a faulty PSE pump (pneumatic system equipment) or vacuum leaks.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair vacuum leaks or replace the PSE pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Convertible Top Hydraulic Cylinder Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Leaks in the hydraulic cylinders that operate the convertible top are a common issue. This can cause the top to operate slowly, unevenly, or not at all. Visible fluid leaks may also be present.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking hydraulic cylinders. Rebuilding services are also available.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per cylinder (parts and labor).

**Interior**

* **Climate Control Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Climate control systems can develop issues such as failing to blow cold air, erratic temperature control, or a noisy blower motor.
    * Solution: Diagnose and repair the faulty component. This may involve replacing the compressor, condenser, blower motor, or climate control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the component.

* **Seat Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power seats can experience motor failures, preventing the seat from moving in one or more directions.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty seat motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per motor.

**Recalls:**

* 2001070006 - POWER STEERING HOSE MAY LEAK FLUID ONTO HOT EXHAUST COMPONENTS

* 2000060004 - INSTRUMENT PANEL MAY CONTAIN INCORRECT INFORMATION

**Summary:**

The 2001 Mercedes-Benz SL600, while luxurious and powerful, can be an expensive car to maintain. The most common issues revolve around the engine (oil leaks, ignition coils), transmission (slipping, conductor plate), suspension (hydraulic system leaks and failures), and electrical system (convertible top malfunctions, instrument cluster pixelation). Many of the repairs are relatively complex, leading to higher labor costs. Overall, potential buyers should be prepared for potentially significant maintenance and repair expenses. Severity of issues ranges from minor inconveniences (pixel loss) to major mechanical failures (transmission rebuild). Costs range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the nature of the problem.
