### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz SL600, while a luxurious and powerful vehicle, presents potential reliability concerns primarily related to its complex V12 engine, advanced Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, and the electro-hydraulic retractable hardtop. Issues with ignition coils, turbochargers, and intercooler leaks are notable for the engine. The ABC system is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the TCM and torque converter, can also arise. Electrical gremlins within the COMAND system and various sensors are also documented. Owners should be prepared for higher maintenance and repair costs associated with these sophisticated systems, emphasizing the importance of regular, specialized servicing.
