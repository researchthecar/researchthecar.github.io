The 2005 Mercedes-Benz SL600 is a luxurious and powerful roadster, part of the R230 generation. It features a potent 5.5L Twin-Turbo V12 engine producing 493 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options for the SL in 2005 included various V6 and V8 engines. Owners often praise the SL600 for its exhilarating performance, refined interior, and advanced features like the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension. Downsides often cited are the high maintenance costs, complex electronics, and potential for expensive repairs, particularly with the V12 engine and ABC system.

**Summary**
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz SL600, while offering a luxurious and powerful driving experience, is prone to several common issues. The V12 engine can suffer from oil leaks and ignition coil failures, leading to expensive repairs. The ABC suspension is a known weak point, with potential leaks and failures that can be very costly to address. Electrical issues, including sensor failures and battery drain, can also arise. The convertible top mechanism, relying on hydraulics, can also present problems. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in the high maintenance costs associated with this vehicle. The severity of the issues ranges from moderate to severe, and the associated costs can be significant.
