**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz SL600 offers impressive performance and luxury but can be prone to several costly issues. Engine problems, particularly oil leaks and coil pack failures in the V12, are common. The ABC suspension system is also a frequent source of trouble due to its complexity and hydraulic components. Electrical issues can also be a headache. Potential owners should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance costs and prioritize a thorough pre-purchase inspection to identify potential problems. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially exceeding several thousand dollars depending on the problem.
