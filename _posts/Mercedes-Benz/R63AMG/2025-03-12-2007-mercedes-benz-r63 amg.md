The 2007 Mercedes-Benz R63 AMG is a unique and powerful vehicle, known for its blend of minivan practicality and AMG performance. While most R-Class models came with more pedestrian engines, the R63 boasted a hand-built 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 507 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the R63 AMG for its surprising acceleration, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior, but dislike its poor fuel economy and potential for high maintenance costs. Other engine options for the R-Class included various V6 and V8 engines, and the transmission remained the 7G-Tronic across most models.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The bolts securing the camshaft adjusters can shear off, leading to engine damage and potential catastrophic failure. Symptoms include rough idling, engine noise (ticking or rattling), check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft adjuster bolts with updated, higher-strength bolts. In severe cases, the entire adjuster unit and potentially the camshafts may need to be replaced if damage has occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory intake manifold is made of a plastic material that can fail over time, leading to vacuum leaks and decreased performance. Symptoms include rough idling, loss of power, and check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold with an updated OEM or aftermarket manifold that uses more robust materials.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Bolt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Certain production runs of the M156 engine were known to have head bolts that were prone to corrosion. Corrosion leads to the bolts stretching or snapping, causing coolant and oil to mix. Symptoms include milky oil, excessive coolant loss, and overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace all head bolts with updated versions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body within the 7G-Tronic transmission is prone to wear and tear, especially in high-performance applications like the R63 AMG. This can lead to rough shifting, delayed engagement, and slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body with updated components. In some cases, a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and extent of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail over time, causing the transmission to shudder or vibrate, particularly during acceleration or gear changes.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (Airmatic)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The R63 AMG utilizes an Airmatic air suspension system, which is prone to leaks and component failures over time. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting unevenly, a sagging suspension, a noisy air compressor, and "Vehicle Level Malfunction" warnings.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair or replace leaking air struts, the air compressor, or the valve block. Sometimes, individual components within the air struts can be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,200 for the compressor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EIS can fail, preventing the vehicle from starting. Symptoms include the key not being recognized, the steering wheel not unlocking, and the car not responding when trying to start it.
    *   Solution: Replace the EIS unit and reprogram it to match the vehicle's keys.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: SAM units control various electrical functions and can fail due to water intrusion or electrical overload. Symptoms can vary greatly depending on which SAM is failing but often include malfunctioning lights, wipers, or other electrical accessories.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty SAM unit and reprogram it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop around the wheel wells, door edges, and undercarriage, especially in regions with harsh winters or coastal climates.
    *   Solution: Repair rust by sanding, treating, and repainting affected areas. In severe cases, body panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the rust.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Command System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The COMAND system, which controls navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions, can experience software glitches, screen failures, and general unresponsiveness.
    *   Solution: Software updates, screen replacement, or replacement of the entire COMAND unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz R63 AMG is a high-performance vehicle with several potential issues that owners should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the M156 engine, particularly the camshaft adjuster bolts, intake manifold, and head bolts, which can lead to expensive repairs. The 7G-Tronic transmission, Airmatic suspension, and electrical systems also have known failure points. Addressing these issues can be costly, making thorough inspection and preventative maintenance essential for maintaining the R63 AMG's performance and reliability.
