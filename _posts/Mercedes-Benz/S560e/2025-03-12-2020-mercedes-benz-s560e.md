The 2020 Mercedes-Benz S560e is a plug-in hybrid luxury sedan that blends performance and efficiency. It features a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 469 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2020 S-Class include various V6, V8, and V12 gasoline engines, as well as diesel options in some markets (though not the S560e in the US). A 9-speed automatic transmission is standard across most of the S-Class range. Owners often praise the S560e for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and advanced technology. Common complaints revolve around the complexity of the infotainment system and the relatively limited all-electric driving range.
