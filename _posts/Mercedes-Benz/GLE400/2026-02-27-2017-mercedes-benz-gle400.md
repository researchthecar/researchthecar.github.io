### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE400 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core powertrain components. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the optional Air Body Control suspension, where leaks can occur, and some electrical gremlins within the COMAND infotainment system. Turbocharger issues and oil leaks are also noted, though not universally reported. Regular maintenance, especially for the transmission, and prompt attention to warning lights are recommended to ensure long-term dependability. For models equipped with the Air Body Control, owners should be aware of potential repair costs associated with the system.
