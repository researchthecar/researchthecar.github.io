### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury. While the powertrain is generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with the twin-turbo V8, particularly concerning the turbochargers and cooling system. The 7-speed automatic transmission can also present some challenges, such as shuddering or harsh shifts, often requiring fluid services or more involved repairs. The AIRMATIC air suspension, while providing a comfortable ride, is a known area for potential costly repairs due to leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, especially within the COMAND infotainment system and parasitic battery drains, are also noted. Despite these potential concerns, many CLS550s are well-maintained and can provide reliable service, but proactive maintenance and budgeting for potential repairs are advisable.
