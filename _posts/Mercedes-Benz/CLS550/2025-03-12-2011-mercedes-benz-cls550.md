The 2011 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 is a stylish and luxurious four-door coupe known for its elegant design and powerful performance. It was praised for its comfortable ride, upscale interior, and advanced technology features. However, some common criticisms included its limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline and relatively high maintenance costs. The CLS550 is equipped with a 5.5-liter V8 engine producing 382 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a 7G-TRONIC 7-speed automatic transmission. No other engine or transmission options were available for this model year.

**Engine**

**5.5L V8 Engine (M273)**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster (Camshaft Magnet) Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the camshaft adjusters, which are located at the front of the engine. You may notice oil on the front of the engine, oil drips on the ground, or a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft adjuster seals and, if necessary, the camshaft adjusters themselves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on whether just the seals or the entire adjuster needs replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light Due to Faulty Crankshaft or Camshaft Position Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates. Diagnostic codes may indicate a problem with the crankshaft or camshaft position sensors. Symptoms can include rough running, stalling, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty crankshaft or camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor fails, causing the suspension to sag or not function properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC 7-Speed Automatic Transmission (722.9)**

*   **Torque Converter Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission issues can occur as the torque converter starts failing, commonly seen as shuddering during light throttle applications.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Torque Converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500-$3,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. Can also cause a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Airmatic suspension system, which uses air springs instead of traditional coil springs, can develop leaks. This leads to a sagging vehicle height, especially overnight, and a malfunctioning suspension that provides a harsh or bouncy ride. The Airmatic compressor may also fail due to overwork.
    * Solution: Repair or replace leaking air springs or struts. Replace the Airmatic compressor if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$2000+ per strut/air spring, $600-$1200+ for the compressor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may not start, the key may not turn in the ignition, or the dashboard lights may not illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the EIS. Requires programming to match the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical issues, such as malfunctioning lights, wipers, or other accessories. The SAM controls and distributes power to many of the vehicle's electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty SAM unit and program it to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by a faulty component not shutting down properly, such as the seat control module, navigation system, or other electronic module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 offers a blend of luxury and performance but can be prone to some common issues. The most significant issues revolve around the Airmatic suspension, electrical components (EIS, SAM), and the 7G-TRONIC transmission. Repairs can be costly, especially for the suspension and electrical systems, due to the complexity of the components and the need for specialized tools and diagnostic equipment. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and budget for potential maintenance and repairs.
