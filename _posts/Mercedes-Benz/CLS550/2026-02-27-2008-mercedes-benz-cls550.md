### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLS550 is a luxurious and powerful vehicle, but its advanced systems can lead to specific reliability concerns as it ages. The 5.5L V8 engine, while potent, can experience issues with the intake manifold runner flaps and oil cooler seals. The 7G-Tronic transmission is generally robust but can develop problems with the valve body or torque converter. The optional AirMatic suspension is a common source of repairs, with leaks in air struts and compressor failures being prevalent. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM unit, can also arise. Interior components like headliners and seat controls may also require attention. Despite these potential issues, many CLS550s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and timely repairs, offering a compelling blend of performance and comfort for those willing to invest in their upkeep.
