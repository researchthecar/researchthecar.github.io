The 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLE63 S AMG is a high-performance SUV blending luxury with serious power. The GLE63 S is powered by a hand-built 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 603 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission (AMG Speedshift TCT 9G). While praised for its exhilarating performance, opulent interior, and advanced technology, some owners have reported issues across various systems. The GLE63 AMG S has a very firm ride due to the performance suspension, which some owners dislike. Also, the infotainment system can be overwhelming to new users.

**Summary**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLE63 S AMG offers exhilarating performance and luxurious appointments but, like any complex vehicle, can experience issues. The most common complaints revolve around the engine (turbo failures, oil leaks), transmission (rough shifting), suspension (air suspension failures), and the electrical system (MBUX glitches). While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to address (trim rattles, sensor replacements), others, such as turbocharger failures or air suspension repairs, can be quite costly. While not extremely common, it's important to be aware of these potential issues when considering purchasing a used 2021 GLE63 S AMG.
