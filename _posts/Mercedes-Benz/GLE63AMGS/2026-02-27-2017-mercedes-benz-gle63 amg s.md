### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE63 AMG S, while a formidable performance SUV, presents potential reliability concerns primarily in its complex powertrain and advanced suspension systems. Owners should be aware of possible issues with the twin-turbo V8 engine's turbochargers and coolant system, as well as the 7-speed AMG transmission's control module and torque converter. The sophisticated Active Curve System and air suspension are also areas where repairs can be costly. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, can also occur. Despite these points, many components, especially exterior and interior elements, are generally robust. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring the longevity of this high-performance vehicle.
