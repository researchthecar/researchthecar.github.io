### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT S, while a performance marvel, exhibits some common issues associated with high-performance vehicles. The powertrain, particularly the transmission's mechatronic unit and clutch packs, can be a source of significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While the engine is generally robust, wastegate actuators and oil coolers have been reported. Suspension components, especially the adaptive dampers, can also require attention. Owners should budget for potential repairs beyond routine maintenance, as complex systems can be prone to failure. Regular servicing by qualified technicians is crucial for mitigating these risks.
