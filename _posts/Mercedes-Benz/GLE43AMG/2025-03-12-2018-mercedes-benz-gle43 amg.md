The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE43 AMG is a performance-oriented SUV that blends luxury with sporty driving dynamics. The GLE43 AMG comes standard with a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 engine producing 385 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the vehicle's powerful engine, luxurious interior, and comfortable ride, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system and occasional problems with the air suspension. Other GLE models such as the GLE350 and GLE550e featured different engines and performance characteristics.

**Engine**

**3.0L Twin-Turbo V6**

*   **Oil Leaks from Turbocharger Oil Feed Lines**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are noticed around the turbochargers. The common source is the oil feed lines that supply oil to the turbochargers. Burning oil smell and visible oil drips may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger oil feed lines with updated parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can develop from the thermostat housing or water pump area. Low coolant light may illuminate, and there may be a visible coolant puddle under the vehicle. Overheating can occur if the leak is severe.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking thermostat housing or water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic (725.0 or 725.1)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop.
    *   Solution: Software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. If that doesn't work, a transmission fluid flush and filter change could alleviate symptoms. In severe cases, valve body replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update), $300-$500 (fluid flush/filter), $1500 - $3000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission fluid leaks, often from the pan gasket or the electrical connector sleeve. Low transmission fluid levels can lead to shifting problems.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking pan gasket or electrical connector sleeve. Check the fluid level and top off as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system may fail, leading to a sagging vehicle ride height, particularly at one corner. Error messages related to the air suspension may appear on the instrument cluster. The air compressor may be excessively loud or not run at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air suspension compressor. Check for air leaks in the system (air struts, lines, valve block) and repair as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One or more corners of the vehicle sit lower than the others, or the vehicle sags overnight. A hissing sound may be audible near the affected strut.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air strut(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+ per strut
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The COMAND infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash. The screen may go blank or display error messages.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. A software update from the dealer may resolve the issue. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset), $100-$300 (software update), $1500 - $3000+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is parked. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw. Common culprits include the infotainment system, alarm system, or faulty control modules. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Panoramic Sunroof Issues**

**Summary**

The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE43 AMG, while a desirable vehicle, has several potential issues that owners should be aware of. Engine oil leaks and coolant leaks are potential concerns, as are transmission shifting issues and leaks. The air suspension system is a known source of problems, with compressor failures and air strut leaks being relatively common. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, can also be frustrating. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more costly repairs. Potential buyers should have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase to identify any existing problems.
