### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG S is a robust performance vehicle, but its complexity means potential for specific issues, particularly in the powertrain and adaptive suspension. The 5.5L twin-turbo V8, while powerful, can experience wastegate actuator problems and intercooler leaks. The AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT transmission may encounter torque converter or mechatronic unit faults. The adaptive air suspension is prone to leaks in air springs or compressor failure. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also noted. While not indicative of a fundamentally unreliable car, these are the primary technical areas where owners might face repair costs beyond standard maintenance.
