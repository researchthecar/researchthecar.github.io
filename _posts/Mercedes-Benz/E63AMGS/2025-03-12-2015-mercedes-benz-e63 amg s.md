**Summary**

The 2015 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG S is a performance machine that demands careful maintenance. The most concerning issues revolve around the engine (turbocharger failure, oil leaks), transmission (harsh shifting, slippage), and air suspension, which can lead to expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins are also common, but often less costly to fix. While the car offers an amazing driving experience, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the high cost of ownership. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. It is important to obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic specializing in Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
