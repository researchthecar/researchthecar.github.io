The 2020 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG S is a high-performance variant of the E-Class sedan, known for its powerful engine and luxurious features. It's equipped with a handcrafted 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 603 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. While other E-Class models offer different engines (like the E350's 2.0L turbo-4 or the E450's 3.0L turbo inline-6), the E63 S is exclusively equipped with the aforementioned V8. All E63 models use the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners praise the E63 S for its exhilarating performance, comfortable ride, and high-quality interior. Some common criticisms include the high price tag, potentially costly maintenance, and occasional complexity of the infotainment system.
