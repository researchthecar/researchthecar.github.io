The 2008 Mercedes-Benz SLK350 is a sporty roadster known for its retractable hardtop, blending open-air driving with coupe comfort. The SLK350 came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 300 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2008 SLK included a 3.0-liter V6 and a 5.5-liter V8. A 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automatic transmission was available. Owners often praise the SLK350 for its stylish design, agile handling, and comfortable interior. Common criticisms include a relatively small trunk, limited rear visibility with the top up, and some reported reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2008 Mercedes-Benz SLK350 can present several common issues. Engine problems such as camshaft adjuster solenoid and valve cover gasket leaks can be relatively inexpensive to address. However, transmission problems with the 7G-Tronic automatic, particularly torque converter or valve body issues, can be quite costly. Electrical issues with the retractable hardtop and SAM modules can also lead to significant repair bills. Suspension issues such as ball joint and strut mount failures also contribute to the cost of ownership. Overall, the 2008 SLK350 can be reliable if well-maintained, but potential owners should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their budget.
