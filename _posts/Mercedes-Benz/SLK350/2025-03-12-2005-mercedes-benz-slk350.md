**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz SLK350, while a desirable roadster, can suffer from a number of issues. The most concerning are related to the engine's balance shaft, timing chain and the transmission. Electrical issues, particularly with the SAM module and retractable hardtop, are also relatively common. Suspension and smaller engine issues like oil leaks can also add to the maintenance costs. The severity and cost of these repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have any prospective purchase thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic familiar with Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
