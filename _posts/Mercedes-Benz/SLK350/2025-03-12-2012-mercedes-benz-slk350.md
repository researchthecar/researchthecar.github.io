The 2012 Mercedes-Benz SLK350 is a sporty and stylish roadster known for its retractable hardtop, providing open-air driving enjoyment with the option of coupe-like comfort. The SLK350 comes equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 302 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2012 SLK include the SLK250 with a turbocharged 1.8-liter inline-4 and the SLK55 AMG with a 5.5-liter V8. All engine options are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the SLK350's balanced handling, upscale interior, and the innovative Airscarf feature, which blows warm air on the neck for comfortable top-down driving in cooler weather. Some common dislikes include the somewhat firm ride and limited rear storage space.
