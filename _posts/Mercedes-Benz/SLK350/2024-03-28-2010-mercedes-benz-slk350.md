Enthusiasts often praise its refined handling, responsive engine, and comfortable ride quality. However, some owners have reported a range of issues with the vehicle.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

* **Intake manifold runner actuator failure:** The intake manifold runner actuator can fail, causing reduced engine performance and increased fuel consumption. Replacing the actuator is necessary, with an estimated cost of $1,000 - $1,500.
* **Balance shaft failure:** In some cases, the balance shaft assembly can fail, resulting in excessive engine vibration and reduced power. Repairing this issue typically involves replacing the balance shaft assembly, costing approximately $2,000 - $3,000.

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission control unit (TCU) failure:** The TCU can malfunction, leading to transmission shifting problems, delayed gear engagement, or even complete failure. Replacing the TCU and updating the software usually resolves the issue, estimated at $1,500 - $2,000.

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension component failure:** Some owners have encountered premature wear or failure of front suspension components, such as control arms or bushings. Replacing these parts restores proper suspension operation, with repair costs ranging from $500 - $1,000 per component.
* **Air suspension malfunction:** The optional air suspension system may experience issues with the air compressor or sensors. This can cause uneven ride height, reduced handling stability, or a complete suspension failure. Repairing or replacing faulty components in the air suspension system can cost $1,000 - $2,000 or more.

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** Excessive battery discharge may occur due to a parasitic electrical draw from various components, such as the infotainment system or ignition switch. Identifying and устранение the source of the draw can vary in cost.
* **Electrical system failure:** In some cases, a failure in the electrical system can result in loss of power, malfunctioning accessories, or even a no-start condition. Repairing this issue typically involves diagnosing and replacing faulty electrical components or modules, with costs ranging from $500 - $2,000+.

**Exterior**

* **Headlight condensation:** Moisture accumulation within the headlight assemblies has been reported in some instances. Replacing the affected headlights resolves the issue, estimated at $500 - $1,000 per headlight.
