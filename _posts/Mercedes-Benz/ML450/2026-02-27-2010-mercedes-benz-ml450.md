### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz ML450, particularly with its hybrid powertrain, presents a mixed reliability profile. The hybrid battery and associated systems are the most significant potential cost centers, with degradation and failure being a known concern. Transmission issues, particularly with the TCM and torque converter, also require attention. The AIRMATIC suspension system, while offering superior comfort, is prone to leaks and component failures, leading to potentially expensive repairs. Standard suspension models are generally more robust. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior are typically well-built, the hybrid components and advanced suspension systems are the primary areas to scrutinize for potential long-term ownership costs.
