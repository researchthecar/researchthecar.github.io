The 2010 Mercedes-Benz GL350 is a full-size luxury SUV known for its spaciousness, comfort, and capability. The GL350 came standard with a 3.0-liter turbo diesel V6 engine producing 210 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, offering good fuel economy for its size. Other engine options included the GL450 with a 4.6-liter V8 (335 hp, 339 lb-ft) and the GL550 with a 5.5-liter V8 (382 hp, 391 lb-ft). All engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GL's smooth ride, luxurious interior, and ample cargo space. Criticisms often revolve around repair costs, particularly for complex systems, and the vehicle's overall size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbo Diesel V6 (OM642)**

*   **Oil Cooler Seal Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks externally from the oil cooler, potentially dripping onto the exhaust and creating a burning oil smell. Can also lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler seals with updated Viton seals. This requires removal of the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+

*   **Swirl Flap Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check Engine Light illuminated. Codes related to the swirl flap motor (e.g., P2015). Reduced engine performance, especially at low RPM. Can lead to carbon buildup in the intake manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the swirl flap motor. Some owners opt to remove the swirl flaps entirely and reprogram the ECU to prevent future issues, but this may not be legal in all areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, Check Engine Light illuminated with DPF-related codes (e.g., P2453). The DPF may become clogged, preventing proper exhaust flow.
    *   Solution: Attempt to regenerate the DPF by driving at highway speeds. If regeneration is not successful, the DPF may need to be professionally cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (cleaning) - $2,500+ (replacement)

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, unusual noises from the turbocharger (e.g., whining or grinding). Check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (722.9)**

*   **Torque Converter Lock-Up Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at low speeds or during light acceleration. Can trigger transmission fault codes.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. Can trigger transmission fault codes.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Some shops may be able to replace individual solenoids within the valve body, but a complete replacement is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission stuck in limp mode, harsh shifting, incorrect gear selection or no gear selection, transmission fault codes.
    * Solution: Replace the conductor plate with an updated revision. The updated revision part number is 722.9.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging or uneven ride height, especially after sitting overnight. The air suspension compressor may run constantly or fail to engage. "Visit Workshop" message may appear on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. Consider replacing the relay at the same time to prevent future compressor failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,800+

*   **Airmatic Strut Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to compressor failure, but localized to one corner of the vehicle. Hissing sound may be heard from the leaking strut.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking airmatic strut.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut

*   **Arnott Brand Airmatic Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Arnott brand airmatic struts can fail prematurely, causing a sagging or uneven ride height. These struts are a popular aftermarket upgrade to address the airmatic issues, but they often have problems on their own.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking airmatic strut with OEM struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut

**Electrical**

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Multiple electrical issues, such as malfunctioning lights, wipers, or power windows. Can also cause issues with the engine or transmission control systems.
    *   Solution: Replace or reprogram the affected SAM unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the vehicle, key not recognized, or complete failure to start.

**Summary**

The 2010 Mercedes-Benz GL350, while luxurious and capable, can present owners with a range of potential issues. The diesel engine, while efficient, is prone to oil leaks, swirl flap problems, and DPF clogging. The 7-speed transmission can suffer from torque converter and valve body failures. The Airmatic suspension is a common source of expense, with compressor and strut failures being prevalent. Electrical issues with the SAM and EIS modules can also be costly to resolve. Overall, while some issues are minor, many of the common problems with the GL350 can result in significant repair bills.
