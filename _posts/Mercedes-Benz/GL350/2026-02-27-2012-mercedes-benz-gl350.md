### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz GL350 offers a compelling blend of luxury and utility, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 3.0L V6 diesel engine, while powerful, is prone to issues with its emissions control systems, including the DPF and EGR valve, which can lead to costly repairs. The 7G-Tronic transmission is generally reliable but can suffer from leaks or torque converter problems. The optional AirMatic suspension is a common source of issues, with leaks in air struts and compressor failures being prevalent. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and various sensors, can also arise. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the GL350 to be a durable and enjoyable vehicle when properly maintained, with many of the issues being addressable with specialized knowledge and parts.
