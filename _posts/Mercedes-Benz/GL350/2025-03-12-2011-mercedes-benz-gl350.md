**Summary**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz GL350 Bluetec, while a luxurious and capable SUV, is prone to several common issues. The most significant problems are related to the diesel engine's emissions systems (DPF, AdBlue), oil leaks, and the Airmatic suspension. Transmission valve body issues are also a concern. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these common failure points and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate (electrical glitches, tail light leaks) to severe (engine/transmission failures, Airmatic system failure). Estimated repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the issue.
