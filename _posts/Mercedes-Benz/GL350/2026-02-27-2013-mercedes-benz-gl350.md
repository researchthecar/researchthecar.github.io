### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz GL350, while offering a premium experience, presents a few key areas that warrant attention regarding reliability. The 3.0L V6 turbo diesel engine, though generally strong, can be susceptible to issues with its emissions control systems, particularly the DPF, EGR valve, and AdBlue system. These can lead to significant repair costs if not addressed promptly. The AirMatic air suspension is another component that can develop leaks or compressor failures over time, impacting ride quality and requiring expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and sensor failures, are also reported. While the transmission and exterior/interior components are generally reliable, potential buyers should be aware of these specific engine and suspension concerns and factor in potential maintenance costs.
