### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz GL350, particularly the diesel variant, presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.0L V6 BlueTEC engine can be prone to issues with its Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), EGR valve, and AdBlue system, which are common in modern diesel vehicles and can be costly to repair. The AIRMATIC air suspension system is a notable area for potential expense, with leaks in air struts and compressor failures being the most common complaints. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and infotainment glitches, can also occur. However, the transmission and general interior/exterior components are generally considered reliable. Proactive maintenance, especially concerning the diesel emissions system and air suspension, is crucial for mitigating potential problems and ensuring the longevity of the GL350.
