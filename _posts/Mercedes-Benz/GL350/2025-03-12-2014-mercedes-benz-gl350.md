**Summary**

The 2014 Mercedes-Benz GL350 BlueTEC 4MATIC offers a luxurious and comfortable ride, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly related to the diesel engine's emissions system (AdBlue heater, DPF) and the air suspension. The 7-speed transmission and electrical systems can also present problems. While some repairs, like replacing oil cooler seals or swirl motors, are relatively moderate in cost, others, such as air suspension repairs or transmission valve body replacement, can be quite expensive. Addressing these issues proactively or having a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic familiar with Mercedes-Benz vehicles is highly recommended.
