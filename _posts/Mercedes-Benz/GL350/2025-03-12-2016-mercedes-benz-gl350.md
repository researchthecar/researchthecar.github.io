**Summary**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GL350, while a luxurious and comfortable SUV, is prone to some common issues. The most prevalent problems revolve around the diesel engine (oil cooler leaks, AdBlue heater, EGR valve) and the air suspension system. Transmission issues, specifically with the torque converter and valve body, can also be costly. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drains and COMAND system malfunctions, add to the potential ownership expenses. While not every GL350 will experience all of these issues, potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas and budget accordingly for potentially expensive repairs.
