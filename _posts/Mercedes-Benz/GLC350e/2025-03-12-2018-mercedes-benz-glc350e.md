The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC350e is a plug-in hybrid SUV that combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine with an electric motor. The combined output is 315 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque. Other GLC models are available with different engines, including a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder without the hybrid system and a more powerful AMG variant. Owners often praise the GLC350e for its fuel efficiency (when utilizing the electric motor), luxurious interior, and comfortable ride. Common complaints include a somewhat small cargo area due to the battery pack and the complexity of the hybrid system, which can lead to potential reliability concerns.
