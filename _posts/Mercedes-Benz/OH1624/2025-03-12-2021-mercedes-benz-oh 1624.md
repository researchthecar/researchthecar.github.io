The 2021 Mercedes-Benz OH 1624 is a bus chassis known for its robust build and suitability for urban and intercity transport. While primarily sold in markets outside of North America, it's favored for its versatility in body customization and its reliable Mercedes-Benz drivetrain. Specific engine and transmission options can vary based on regional market specifications, but it generally features a diesel engine with horsepower in the 235 hp range and torque in the 627 lb-ft range. Drivers often appreciate its durability and comfortable ride, but some criticize its fuel economy compared to more modern buses.

**Engine**

**OM 936 LA (7.7L Diesel)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased power, increased fuel consumption, black smoke from exhaust. Can eventually lead to engine misfires and potential damage to the catalytic converter.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. It is recommended to replace all injectors on the affected cylinder bank to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noise from the engine bay, loss of power, increased exhaust smoke (often blue or black), engine warning light.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Mercedes-Benz G85-6 (6-Speed Manual)**

*   **Synchro Failure**

**Summary:**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz OH 1624 bus chassis, while generally reliable, experiences common issues primarily related to its diesel engine and transmission systems. Specifically, the OM 936 LA engine can suffer from fuel injector and turbocharger problems, leading to performance degradation. The G85-6 manual transmission can experience synchro failure while the GO 210 automatic transmission can experience torque converter failure. Suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior issues, while present, tend to be less frequent and less severe. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for more complex engine or transmission overhauls.
