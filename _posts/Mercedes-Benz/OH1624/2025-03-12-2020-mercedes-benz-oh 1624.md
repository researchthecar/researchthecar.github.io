The 2020 Mercedes-Benz OH 1624 is a heavy-duty bus chassis, primarily used in South America and other global markets. Information on owner complaints and issues is limited in widely accessible databases compared to passenger vehicles sold in the US or Europe. The OH 1624 is typically powered by a Mercedes-Benz OM 924 LA four-cylinder diesel engine, producing around 218 horsepower and a substantial amount of torque suitable for hauling large passenger loads. While highly regarded for its durability and suitability for public transportation, owners have reported common issues associated with high-mileage diesel engines and demanding operational conditions. Common likes include its robust chassis and fuel efficiency, while dislikes often revolve around maintenance costs and parts availability in certain regions.

**Engine**

**OM 924 LA Diesel Engine**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, whistling noise from the turbocharger, check engine light.
