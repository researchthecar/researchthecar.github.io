The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (marketed as the "Boxer 40" in some markets) is a popular cargo van and passenger van known for its spacious interior, durability, and fuel efficiency (particularly the diesel models). It was offered with various engine options, including a 2.7L inline-5 diesel engine (OM647) and a 3.5L V6 gasoline engine. The diesel engine produces approximately 154 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the Sprinter for its high roof, ease of customization, and long lifespan. Common complaints include concerns about rust, electrical issues, and relatively high maintenance costs compared to domestic vans.
