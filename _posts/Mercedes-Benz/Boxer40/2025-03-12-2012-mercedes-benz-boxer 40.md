The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 40, also known as the Boxer 40 in some markets, is a popular van known for its utility and practicality. Engine options for this model year include the 2.1L inline-4 diesel engine, producing around 129 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, and the more powerful 3.0L V6 diesel, generating about 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed automatic for the inline-4 and a 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual for the V6. Owners often appreciate the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and relatively fuel-efficient diesel engines.
