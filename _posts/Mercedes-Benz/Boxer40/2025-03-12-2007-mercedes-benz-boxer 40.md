The 2007 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (also known as the Boxer 40 in some markets) is a versatile van popular for commercial and recreational use. Engine options for the 2007 Sprinter typically included a 2.1L Inline-4 Turbo Diesel CDI (109 hp, 207 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.0L V6 Turbo Diesel CDI (154 hp, 280 lb-ft of torque) depending on the market. A gasoline engine might have been available as well in certain regions. These engines are typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.
