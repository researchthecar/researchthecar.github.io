The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 4500 is a popular cargo van known for its versatility and capability. For the 2021 model year, the Sprinter 4500 offered a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine producing 188 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 3.0-liter V6 diesel engine generating 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter for its spacious interior, customizable configurations, and smooth ride, but some have reported issues with the electrical system and certain components of the engine and transmission.

**3.0L V6 Diesel**

* **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the DEF system, including error messages related to DEF level or quality, even when the system is full and functioning properly. This can lead to the van entering limp mode (reduced power).
    * Solution: Diagnosing the DEF system can be complex, often requiring specialized diagnostic equipment. Potential fixes include replacing the DEF sensor, the DEF injector, or the DEF pump. In some cases, a software update may resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can manifest as a noticeable jerk or hesitation during acceleration.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may improve shifting performance. If the problem persists, it could indicate a more serious issue with the valve body or internal components of the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Malfunctioning Sensors**
    * Description/Symptoms: A number of sensors throughout the van can fail, including those for the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), oxygen sensors, and mass airflow (MAF) sensors. Symptoms vary based on which sensor has failed, but can include warning lights on the dashboard, reduced engine performance, and poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Diagnosis involves identifying the faulty sensor using a scan tool and replacing it with a new one.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Multimedia System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the MBUX multimedia system, including freezing, lagging, and unresponsive touchscreens.
    * Solution: Attempting a system reset is a typical first step. If this does not work, a software update or replacement of the unit may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Rattling and Squeaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many owners report excessive rattles and squeaks emanating from various interior panels, especially in the rear cargo area.
    * Solution: Identifying the source of the noise can be challenging. Often, it requires adding sound-deadening material or tightening loose panels.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sliding door can experience issues with its rollers, locking mechanisms, and automatic opening/closing systems. This can lead to difficulty opening or closing the door, or it not sealing properly.
    * Solution: Repairing the sliding door may involve lubricating the rollers, adjusting the locking mechanism, or replacing faulty components of the power-assist system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found
