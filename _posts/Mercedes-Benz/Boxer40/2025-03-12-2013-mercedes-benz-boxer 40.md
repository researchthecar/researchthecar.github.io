The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 (often referred to as a "Boxer 40" due to its use as a cargo van) is a versatile vehicle popular for commercial and personal use. Engine options included a 2.1L Turbo Diesel Inline-4 producing around 161 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Turbo Diesel V6 producing around 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Sprinter's spacious cargo area and fuel efficiency (especially with the diesel engines), but some common complaints include higher maintenance costs compared to domestic vans and potential issues with certain emissions components.
