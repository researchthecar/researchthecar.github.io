The 2019 Mercedes-Benz SLC300 is a stylish and fun roadster, powered by a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 241 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for this model year of the SLC included a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine in the SLC43 variant. It is offered exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate its sleek design, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology.
