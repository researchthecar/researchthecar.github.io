The 2018 Mercedes-Benz SLC300 is a stylish and sporty roadster offering a blend of luxury and performance. Its heart is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 241 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available in the SLC lineup (but not the SLC300) include a more powerful V6 in the AMG SLC43. Owners often praise the SLC300 for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and retractable hardtop. Criticisms tend to focus on the somewhat cramped interior and dated infotainment system compared to newer Mercedes models.
