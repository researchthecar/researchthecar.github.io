The 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC300 is a stylish and sporty roadster, offering a blend of luxury and performance. The SLC300 is equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 241 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. While admired for its retractable hardtop, nimble handling, and upscale interior, some owners have reported certain issues. Dislikes often include the limited rear visibility with the top up, tight cabin space, and the higher price point compared to some competitors. The SLC43 AMG with a 3.0L V6 Biturbo and the SLC Final Edition models were also available but are not covered here.

**Summary**

The 2020 Mercedes-Benz SLC300, while generally reliable, can experience issues with the engine (oil leaks, sensor failures) and transmission (rough shifting, torque converter problems). The electrical system, particularly the retractable hardtop and COMAND system, is another area of concern. These issues can range from minor inconveniences to more costly repairs. Severity varies depending on the specific issue, but the potential costs of repairs, particularly for the transmission and retractable hardtop mechanisms, should be considered.
