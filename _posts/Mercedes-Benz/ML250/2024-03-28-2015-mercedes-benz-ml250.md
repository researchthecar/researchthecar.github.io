**Introduction**

The 2015 Mercedes-Benz ML250 is a midsize luxury SUV powered by a 2.1-liter turbocharged diesel engine that produces 201 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. The ML250 is praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency, but it has received some complaints regarding reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.1-liter Turbocharged Diesel**

* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail prematurely, leading to reduced engine power and fuel efficiency. Symptoms may include a loud whining noise from the engine, black smoke from the exhaust, and decreased acceleration. The solution is to replace the turbocharger, which costs approximately $1,500 - $2,000+.
* **EGR valve failure:** The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged or malfunction, leading to decreased engine performance and increased emissions. Symptoms may include a rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, and increased fuel consumption. The solution is to replace the EGR valve, which costs approximately $300 - $500+.

**Transmission**

**7-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip or hesitate when shifting gears, leading to a lack of power or unexpected vehicle behavior. Symptoms may include a jerking motion, delayed or sluggish gear changes, and an inability to accelerate smoothly. The solution is to replace or rebuild the transmission, which costs approximately $2,000 - $3,000+.
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can fail, causing a loss of power, shuddering, or a slipping feeling during acceleration. Symptoms may include a humming or whining noise, vibration, and difficulty in shifting gears. The solution is to replace the torque converter, which costs approximately $800 - $1,200+.

**Suspension**

* **Air suspension failure:** The air suspension system can fail, leading to a rough ride, uneven ride height, or suspension collapse. Symptoms may include a noticeable drop in the vehicle's ride height, a soft or bouncy ride, and difficulty in handling the vehicle. The solution is to repair or replace the air suspension components, which costs approximately $1,000 - $2,000+ per strut.
* **Front suspension clunking noise:** Some ML250 models have experienced a clunking noise from the front suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Symptoms may include a loud, metallic clunking sound from the front of the vehicle. The solution is to replace the upper control arms, which costs approximately $400 - $600+ per side.

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** Some ML250 models have experienced a rapid battery drain, even when the vehicle is turned off. Symptoms may include difficulty starting the vehicle, flickering lights, or a dead battery. The solution is to identify and fix the electrical drain, which could involve repairing electrical wiring, replacing a faulty alternator, or updating software. The cost to fix can vary depending on the cause.
* **Electrical system malfunction:** Malfunctions in the electrical system can occur, leading to a variety of issues. Symptoms may include flickering lights, inoperative electronic components, or a complete electrical system failure. The solution is to diagnose and repair the electrical system, which could involve replacing faulty components, repairing wiring, or updating software. The cost to fix can vary depending on the cause.

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof leaks:** Some ML250 models have experienced sunroof leaks, allowing water to enter the vehicle's interior. Symptoms may include water stains on the headliner, wet carpets, or a musty smell in the cabin. The solution is to repair or replace the sunroof seals or drainage system, which costs approximately $300 - $500+.

**Interior**

* **Navigation system issues:** The navigation system may experience glitches or malfunctions, leading to incorrect directions, map data errors, or a complete system failure. Symptoms may include inaccurate navigation instructions, frozen map screens, or an inability to use the navigation system. The solution is to update the navigation software or replace the navigation system, which costs approximately $500 - $1,000+.
* **Climate control problems:** Some ML250 models have experienced issues with the climate control system, such as malfunctioning temperature controls, uneven airflow, or a lack of cooling or heating. Symptoms may include difficulty adjusting the temperature, inconsistent airflow, or a lack of cool or warm air. The solution is to diagnose and repair the climate control system, which could involve replacing faulty components or updating software. The cost to fix can vary depending on the cause.

**Summary**

The 2015 Mercedes-Benz ML250 has been praised for its comfort and performance, but it has also received some complaints regarding reliability issues. Potential issues include turbocharger and EGR valve failures in the engine, transmission slipping and torque converter failures in the transmission, air suspension problems and front suspension clunking in the suspension, electrical system malfunctions, sunroof leaks, navigation system issues, and climate control problems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage.
