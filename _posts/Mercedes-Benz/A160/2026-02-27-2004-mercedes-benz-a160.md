# 2004 Mercedes-Benz A160

### Overview
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz A160, part of the W169 generation, aimed to bring premium compact car features to a wider audience. While generally considered a competent vehicle for its time, like any car, it has specific areas where owners have reported issues. This analysis focuses on documented technical reliability concerns beyond routine maintenance. The A160 was known for its innovative 'sandwich' floor construction, which housed the engine and drivetrain components, contributing to its compact size and safety features. However, this unique design could also influence certain repair procedures and potential problem areas.

### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz A160 presents a mixed reliability profile. The 1.7L petrol engine is generally robust but can suffer from common issues like ignition coil failures and minor oil leaks. The 5-speed automatic transmission is a notable area for concern, with reports of harsh shifting and slipping, often requiring significant repair. Manual transmissions are more reliable. Suspension components, particularly control arm bushings, can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and sensor failures, are also documented. Interior components like the HVAC resistor and seat wear are typical for a vehicle of this age. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of the transmission's propensity for issues and budget for potential electrical and suspension repairs.
