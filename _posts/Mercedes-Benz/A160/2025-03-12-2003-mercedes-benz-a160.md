The 2003 Mercedes-Benz A160 is a subcompact car, known for its innovative packaging and fuel efficiency. The A160 came equipped with a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 102 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included other gasoline and diesel engines. Transmission options generally included a 5-speed manual or an automatic transmission. Owners often praised the A160 for its spacious interior relative to its small size and its fuel economy, but criticisms often revolved around its somewhat unconventional styling, ride quality, and some reported reliability issues.
