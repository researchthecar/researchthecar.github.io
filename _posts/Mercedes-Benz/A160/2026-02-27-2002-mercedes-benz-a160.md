- **Solution:** Replacement of faulty ignition coil(s).
- **Cost:** $150 - $300

**Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gasket)**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil around the top of the engine, burning oil smell, potential for oil to drip onto exhaust manifold.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the valve cover gasket.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Automatic (Autotronic CVT)
**Transmission Fluid Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Leaking fluid from seals or lines, potential for slipping gears, rough shifting, or transmission failure if not addressed.
- **Solution:** Repair or replacement of leaking seals, hoses, or transmission cooler lines. Fluid flush and refill may be necessary.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800

**CVT Belt Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Hesitation during acceleration, slipping sensation, unusual noises from the transmission.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the CVT belt and potentially other internal components. This is a complex repair.
- **Cost:** $1500 - $3000+


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Bushings (Control Arm, Sway Bar)**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn suspension bushings.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500

**Shock Absorber Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, poor handling, visible leaks from shock absorbers.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn shock absorbers (usually in pairs).
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Electrical

### General Electrical System
**Window Regulator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows not operating, slow window movement, grinding noises when operating windows.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the window regulator mechanism.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400

**Central Locking Malfunctions**
- **Symptoms:** Doors not locking or unlocking consistently, individual door locks failing.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and repair/replacement of faulty door lock actuators or control modules.

### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz A160 (W168) presents a mixed reliability profile. While its compact size and practicality are appealing, potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The petrol engine can suffer from ignition coil failures and oil leaks. The Autotronic CVT transmission, while innovative, is a known weak point, with potential for leaks and belt wear, leading to costly repairs. Suspension components like bushings and shocks can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and central locking, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain areas. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and various rattles can detract from the experience. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are crucial for managing the long-term reliability of this model.
