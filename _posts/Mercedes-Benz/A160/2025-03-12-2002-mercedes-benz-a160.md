The 2002 Mercedes-Benz A160 is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and innovative design for its time, maximizing interior space within a small footprint. The A160 variant typically features a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine, producing around 102 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. Other available engine options for the 2002 A-Class included smaller and larger gasoline engines, as well as diesel variants. Transmission options generally consisted of a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the A-Class for its practicality, maneuverability, and relatively low running costs. However, some common criticisms include concerns about reliability, particularly regarding electronic components and some engine-related issues, as well as the potential for higher repair costs compared to more mainstream compact cars.
