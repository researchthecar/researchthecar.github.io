The 2004 Mercedes-Benz A160 is a subcompact car known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. The A160 featured a 1.6-liter inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 102 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included other gasoline and diesel variants, such as the A140, A170, A190, A200, A170 CDI, and A200 CDI. Transmission options were typically a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the A160 for its compact size, making it easy to maneuver and park in urban environments, as well as its relatively spacious interior for its class. Common dislikes include the somewhat firm ride quality and potential reliability issues typical of older European cars.
