### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz A160 (W169) presents a generally reliable package, with the 1.7L petrol engine being the primary option. Common concerns tend to revolve around the Autotronic CVT transmission, particularly fluid leaks and torque converter issues, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmission is less prone to major issues, though clutch wear is a standard maintenance item. Electrical gremlins, such as ABS/ESP sensor failures and window regulator problems, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Exterior and interior components are typically robust, with no widespread critical failures reported. Owners should be mindful of potential transmission issues and ensure regular maintenance, especially fluid checks.
