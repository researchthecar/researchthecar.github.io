The 2019 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT 53 is a high-performance four-door coupe that blends luxury with sports car thrills. Its sleek design and powerful engines make it a desirable vehicle. Engine options include a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbo engine with EQ Boost (mild hybrid system), producing 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque.
