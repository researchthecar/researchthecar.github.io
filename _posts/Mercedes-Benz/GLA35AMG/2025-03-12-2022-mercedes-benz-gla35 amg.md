**Summary**

The 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLA35 AMG, while a sporty and luxurious vehicle, appears to have some common issues centered around the engine, transmission, electrical system, and interior trim. The engine issues, such as coolant leaks and fuel pump failures, can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, particularly rough shifting and hesitation, seem to be a recurring theme. Electrical glitches with the MBUX system and sensors can also be frustrating for owners. While interior trim noises are more of an annoyance, they can detract from the overall luxury experience. The severity of these issues varies, but the potential repair costs should be considered when evaluating this vehicle.
