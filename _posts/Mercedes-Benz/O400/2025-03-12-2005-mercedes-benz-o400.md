The 2005 Mercedes-Benz O400 is a popular transit bus known for its reliability and durability. While specific engine options can vary depending on the region and configuration, a common engine choice is the Mercedes-Benz OM457 series diesel engine. This engine typically produces around 250-300 horsepower and substantial torque, crucial for hauling passengers and navigating city streets. Owners often appreciate the O400 for its robust build quality and longevity, but potential drawbacks include its age, which can lead to increased maintenance needs, and potential issues with older components.

**Engine**

**OM457 Series Diesel Engine**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are observed from the water pump, radiator, or hoses. This can lead to overheating and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty water pump, radiator, or hoses. Thoroughly inspect the cooling system for other potential leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and difficulty starting the engine. These issues often stem from clogged or failing fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty fuel injector(s) and replace them. Consider cleaning the remaining injectors and checking the fuel filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF Ecomat Automatic Transmission**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, shifts harshly, or fails to engage properly. This can be caused by worn clutches, low transmission fluid, or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, a valve body rebuild or complete transmission overhaul may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid/filter) - $3000+ (overhaul)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission overheats, leading to reduced performance and potential damage. This can be caused by a faulty transmission cooler or internal transmission problems.
    *   Solution: Inspect the transmission cooler for leaks or clogs. If the cooler is functioning properly, internal transmission repairs may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (cooler) - $2000+ (internal repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension System Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system loses pressure, causing the bus to sag or lean to one side. This can be due to leaks in the air bags, air lines, or height control valves.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair the leaks in the air suspension system. This may involve replacing air bags, air lines, or height control valves.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per air bag
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. This is often caused by worn or damaged suspension bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn suspension bushings. This can improve ride quality and handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Lighting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights, taillights, or interior lights malfunction or fail to operate. This can be caused by faulty bulbs, wiring issues, or a malfunctioning lighting control module.

**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz O400, while generally reliable, can experience several common issues due to its age. Engine issues, particularly those related to coolant leaks and fuel injectors, are prevalent. Transmission problems, especially with the ZF Ecomat transmission, such as slipping and overheating, require careful attention. Suspension and electrical issues are also common, with air suspension leaks and lighting problems being the most frequently reported. Rust is the most frequent exterior concern, and HVAC problems may arise. The cost of repairs can vary widely, ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major overhauls. Potential buyers should have a mechanic do a thorough inspection to address any potential issues and ensure reliable operation.
