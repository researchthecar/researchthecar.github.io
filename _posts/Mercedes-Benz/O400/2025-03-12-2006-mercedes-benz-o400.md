The 2006 Mercedes-Benz O400 is a popular transit bus known for its reliability and durability, often used in public transportation systems. While specific engine and transmission configurations can vary depending on the region and intended use, a common engine option is the Mercedes-Benz OM457hLA, a turbocharged and intercooled 12.0-liter inline-6 diesel engine producing around 300 horsepower and 922 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include automatic transmissions like the ZF Ecomat series. Owners appreciate the O400's robust construction and longevity, but some common complaints involve maintenance costs and the availability of specific replacement parts due to the vehicle's age.
