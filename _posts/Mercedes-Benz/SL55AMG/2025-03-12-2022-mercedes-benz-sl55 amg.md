**Engine**

**4.0L V8 Biturbo**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are reported from various points on the engine, including the valve covers, oil pan, and turbocharger lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking gaskets, seals, or lines. Retorque bolts to specification if loosening is the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms include loss of power, unusual noises (whining or screeching), and potentially check engine lights.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger(s). Inspect the oil supply lines to the turbos for blockage to prevent future failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+

**Transmission**

**AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9-Speed**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report instances of rough or delayed shifting, particularly during downshifts or in specific driving modes. Hesitation upon acceleration can also occur.
    *   Solution: Software update for the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, a transmission flush and filter replacement may be necessary. In more severe cases, valve body replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and the solution)

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Air suspension can exhibit issues such as uneven ride height, sagging, failure to adjust properly, or error messages on the dashboard. This can be caused by leaks in the air lines, faulty air struts, or a failing air compressor.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair any air leaks. Replace faulty air struts or the air compressor if necessary. Recalibrate the suspension system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ per strut (depending on location and labor).

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX infotainment system may occasionally freeze, lag, or exhibit glitches. This can include unresponsive touchscreens, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software update for the MBUX system. A hard reset of the system might temporarily resolve the issue. In some cases, component replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update) to $1,500+ (if component replacement is needed).
*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions of various sensors, such as parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring sensors, or rain sensors, have been reported. Symptoms include error messages, non-functional features, or erratic behavior.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific faulty sensor and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the sensor.
*   **Convertible Top Operation Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties with the convertible top mechanism including slow operation, getting stuck, or failing to open or close completely. This can stem from hydraulic pump issues, sensor problems, or misaligned components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause of the problem using diagnostic tools. Check hydraulic fluid levels and pressure. Repair or replace faulty components.
