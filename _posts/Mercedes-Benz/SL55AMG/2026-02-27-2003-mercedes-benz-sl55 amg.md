### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but its complexity, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the retractable hardtop, means potential for significant repair costs. The supercharged V8 engine is robust, but associated components like the supercharger belt and intercooler pump can require attention. Transmission issues, while not universal, can arise with the conductor plate or TCM. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM unit, are also a known concern. Owners should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair expenses, especially for the specialized hydraulic and electronic systems. Regular, diligent maintenance by a qualified technician is crucial for long-term reliability.
