The 2007 Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMG is a performance roadster boasting a supercharged 5.4L V8 engine producing 493 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. The SL55 AMG offers brisk acceleration and a luxurious driving experience. The main complaint with the vehicle is its high cost of ownership and maintenance. Many appreciate the performance capabilities, while others dislike the sometimes-unreliable electronic systems. The other SL models available in 2007 include SL500, SL600, and SL65 AMG. The SL500 has a naturally aspirated 5.0L V8, the SL600 has a twin-turbo 5.5L V12, and the SL65 AMG has a twin-turbo 6.0L V12. All models came standard with a 5-speed automatic transmission except the SL65 AMG, which came with a 5-speed AMG Speedshift transmission.
