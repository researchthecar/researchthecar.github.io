### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMG is a highly desirable performance car, but its advanced technology, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and the complex retractable hardtop, can be sources of significant repair costs if issues arise. The supercharged V8 engine is generally robust, but components like the supercharger clutch and intercooler pump can require attention. Transmission issues, while not universal, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM unit, are also a known concern. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair bills, especially for the specialized systems. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a budget for potential repairs are highly recommended.
