The 2003 Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMG is a high-performance roadster featuring a hand-built 5.4L supercharged V8 engine producing 493 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. It was available exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its incredible power, luxurious interior, and distinctive styling. Criticisms often revolve around its complexity, potential for high maintenance costs, and occasional electronic gremlins.

**Engine**

**5.4L Supercharged V8 (M113K)**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump circulates coolant to cool the air entering the engine after it's been compressed by the supercharger. If the pump fails, the engine can experience a significant loss of power, especially under hard acceleration, due to reduced cooling efficiency. Check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the intercooler pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger clutch engages and disengages the supercharger. If the clutch fails, the supercharger may not engage properly or at all, resulting in a noticeable decrease in power and a possible rattling noise.
    *   Solution: Replace the supercharger clutch or the entire supercharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough running, or failure to start. Check engine light will illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking onto exhaust manifold, causing a burning smell. Visible oil residue around the valve covers.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, limp mode (transmission stuck in a single gear), delayed engagement. The check engine light will likely be on.
    *   Solution: Replace the transmission conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during acceleration. Unusual noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) System Leaks and Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, ride height issues, stiff ride, error messages on the dashboard related to the ABC system. The ABC system uses hydraulic fluid and accumulators to control the suspension. Leaks can occur at the struts, valve blocks, or pump. The pump itself can also fail. Accumulators can lose their nitrogen charge, resulting in a harsh ride.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the specific component causing the issue. This could involve replacing struts, valve blocks, the pump, accumulators, or hydraulic lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the component and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABC Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A whining noise from the pump area, stiff suspension, and ABC warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replace the ABC pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the instrument cluster display fade or disappear, making it difficult to read information.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for a few days. This can be caused by various electrical components that are not shutting down properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the battery drain. This could involve testing and replacing faulty modules or components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Convertible Top Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The convertible top fails to open or close properly, or gets stuck mid-cycle. This can be due to hydraulic pump failure, sensor issues, or problems with the locking mechanisms.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the specific cause of the malfunction. This may involve replacing the hydraulic pump, sensors, or repairing the locking mechanisms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Hydraulic Cylinder Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks in the hydraulic cylinders that control the convertible top operation. This can cause the top to operate slowly or not at all. Fluid may be visible in the trunk area or dripping from the top mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the leaking hydraulic cylinders.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+ per cylinder
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters fail to function.
    *   Solution: Replace the seat heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per seat
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMG is a powerful and luxurious car, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The ABC suspension system, electrical gremlins, and convertible top malfunctions can lead to costly repairs. While the engine and transmission are generally reliable, issues like intercooler pump failure and conductor plate failure are not uncommon. Overall, owning this car requires a commitment to preventative maintenance and a willingness to address potential problems as they arise. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
