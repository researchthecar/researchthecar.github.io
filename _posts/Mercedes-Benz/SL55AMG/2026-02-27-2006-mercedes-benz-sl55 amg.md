### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMG offers exhilarating performance but comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly in its advanced systems. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a common source of expensive repairs, with leaks from pumps, lines, or struts being frequent. The supercharged V8 engine, while powerful, can suffer from issues like spark plug blowout and supercharger clutch failure. Transmission problems, often related to the conductor plate or TCM, can also arise. Electrical gremlins, especially involving the SAM unit, and malfunctions in the complex retractable hardtop system are not uncommon. While the interior generally holds up well, climate control and seat adjustment motors can be points of failure. Owners should budget for potential maintenance and repairs, especially for the ABC system and engine-related issues, to ensure the longevity and enjoyment of this high-performance luxury vehicle.
