### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz S550 is a luxurious and powerful vehicle, but its advanced systems can lead to significant repair costs as it ages. Key areas to monitor include the engine's timing chain tensioners and intake manifold, the 7-speed transmission's valve body and torque converter, and especially the complex Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, which is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures. Electrical issues, particularly with the EIS and SAM modules, are also common. While the interior and exterior are generally robust, minor issues like door handles and sunroof drains can arise. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair bills, especially concerning the suspension and complex electronics.
