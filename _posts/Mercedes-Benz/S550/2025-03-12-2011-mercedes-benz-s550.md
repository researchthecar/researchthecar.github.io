The 2011 Mercedes-Benz S550 is a luxury sedan known for its opulent features, smooth ride, and powerful engine. The standard engine option is a 4.6L Twin Turbo V8 producing 429 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Some owners praise its comfortable interior and advanced technology, while others criticize its high maintenance costs and complex electronics. Additional engine options included a 5.5L naturally aspirated V8 in the S550 4Matic and AMG variants. The 4Matic versions are prone to additional drivetrain issues due to the all-wheel-drive system.
