The 2014 Mercedes-Benz S550 is a luxury sedan lauded for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and advanced technology. The S550 came standard with a 4.7L twin-turbo V8 engine producing 455 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic Plus). Other engine options included a V6, a diesel V6 (in some markets), and a V12 in the S600. Higher-performance AMG variants offered even more powerful engines. Owners often praise the S550 for its comfortable seats, quiet cabin, and sophisticated features.
