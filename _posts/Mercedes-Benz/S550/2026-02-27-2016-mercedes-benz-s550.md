### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz S550 is a highly sophisticated luxury vehicle that generally offers a reliable ownership experience. The primary areas that may require attention are related to its advanced AIRMATIC air suspension system, particularly air strut leaks and compressor failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted concerns. The powerful 4.7L twin-turbo V8 engine and the 7-speed transmission are robust, but occasional issues with ignition coils, valve cover gaskets, and the transmission control module can arise. Despite these potential issues, the S550's overall reliability is strong for its class, provided regular maintenance is performed and potential problems are addressed promptly.
