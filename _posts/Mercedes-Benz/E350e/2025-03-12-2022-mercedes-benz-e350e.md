The 2022 Mercedes-Benz E350e is a plug-in hybrid variant of the popular E-Class sedan, offering a blend of luxury, performance, and fuel efficiency. It features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of 315 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline-only E350 model shares the same 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, but without the hybrid components, while the E450 receives a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbo with mild hybrid assist. All models typically come with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the E350e's refined ride, elegant interior, and advanced technology features. However, some common dislikes often include the complex infotainment system, the higher price point compared to non-hybrid models, and potential concerns regarding the long-term reliability of the hybrid system.
