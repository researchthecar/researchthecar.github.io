The 2022 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 1500 is a versatile van popular for both commercial and recreational use. Engine options include a 2.0L Turbocharged Gas engine producing 188 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Turbo Diesel engine producing 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engine options are paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, customizable configurations, and refined driving experience. However, common complaints include the vehicle's relatively high price, potential for expensive repairs, and some reported issues with electronic components.
