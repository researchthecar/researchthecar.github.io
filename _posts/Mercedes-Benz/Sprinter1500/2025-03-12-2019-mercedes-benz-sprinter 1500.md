The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 1500 is a popular choice for businesses and individuals needing a versatile and spacious van. Available engine options for this model year include a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 gasoline engine producing 188 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L turbodiesel V6 engine producing 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, high roof options, and comfortable ride. Some common dislikes include the van's high price point and relatively poor fuel economy.
