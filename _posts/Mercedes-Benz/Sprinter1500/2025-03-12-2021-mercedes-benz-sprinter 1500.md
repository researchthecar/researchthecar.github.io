The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 1500 is a versatile van popular for commercial use and camper conversions. It offers a range of configurations and is appreciated for its spacious cargo area, comfortable ride (for a van), and available technology. However, some owners have reported issues with reliability and the cost of maintenance. Available engines include a 2.0L turbocharged 4-cylinder gasoline engine producing 188 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L turbodiesel V6 producing 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission (9G-TRONIC). Some common complaints include electrical glitches, emissions system problems (especially with the diesel), and relatively high maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder Gasoline Engine**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.0L Turbodiesel V6 Engine**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Check Engine Light" illuminated, error messages related to DEF quality or level, potential limp mode activation. Issues include faulty DEF sensors, clogged DEF injectors, and malfunctioning DEF pumps.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis using a scan tool to pinpoint the specific component failure. Replacement of the faulty DEF sensor, injector, or pump. Cleaning of DEF lines and tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the failed component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased engine performance, increased emissions, and "Check Engine Light" with EGR-related codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, hesitation during acceleration, particularly when shifting between lower gears. Can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM). In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may resolve the issue. If these don't work, valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software updates; $200 - $500 for fluid/filter; $1500 - $3000+ for valve body replacement.

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights illuminating on the dashboard, including those related to the ABS, traction control, tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), or other systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the specific faulty sensor. Replacement of the malfunctioning sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor, depending on the location and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software update to the infotainment system. In some cases, a system reset or replacement of the head unit may be necessary.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+, depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 1500, while appreciated for its utility and features, can present owners with a range of issues. The most significant problems tend to revolve around the diesel engine's emissions systems and electrical glitches. Transmission issues are less frequent but can be costly to address if a valve body replacement is required. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences (infotainment glitches) to potentially disabling problems (DEF system failures). Repair costs can vary significantly, with diesel engine repairs and transmission work potentially exceeding $1000. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in the possibility of higher maintenance costs when considering this vehicle.
