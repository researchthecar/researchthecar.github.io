The 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS450 is a sleek and stylish four-door coupe, known for its luxurious interior and comfortable ride. The CLS450 is powered by a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbocharged engine with EQ Boost, producing 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. A 9-speed automatic transmission is standard. Other available engines in the 2019 CLS lineup included an AMG-enhanced 3.0L inline-6 turbo (CLS53) and a 2.0L inline-4 turbo (CLS300d available in some markets). Owners often praise the car's elegant design, refined driving experience, and advanced technology features. Common dislikes include the relatively limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline and the complexity of the infotainment system.
