**Introduction:**

The 1993 Mercedes-Benz 190E is a compact executive sedan known for its luxurious interior, agile handling, and reliable performance. It was available with three engine options: a 1.8-liter inline-four (122 horsepower, 129 lb-ft of torque), a 2.3-liter inline-four (136 horsepower, 155 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.6-liter inline-six (162 horsepower, 162 lb-ft of torque). Buyers had a choice of a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. While praised for its comfort and driving dynamics, the 190E has encountered several common issues over the years.

**Engine**

* **1.8-liter inline-four**
    * **Cracked cylinder head:** A flaw in the design of the cylinder head can cause it to crack, resulting in oil and coolant leaks. The solution involves replacing the cylinder head, which costs approximately $2,000 - $4,000+.
    * **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket may deteriorate over time, causing vacuum leaks and rough engine performance. Replacing the gasket generally costs between $300 - $700+.
* **2.3-liter inline-four**
    * **Crankshaft position sensor failure:** The crankshaft position sensor can fail, leading to erratic engine behavior or stalling. Replacing the sensor costs around $150 - $300+.
* **2.6-liter inline-six**
    * **Throttle position sensor issues:** Malfunctioning throttle position sensors can cause engine stalling, surging, or poor acceleration. The cost of replacing them typically ranges from $200 - $400+.
    * **Vacuum leaks:** Loose or damaged vacuum lines can create air leaks, resulting in rough idling or reduced engine power. This issue can be resolved by replacing the affected vacuum lines, which usually costs between $100 - $250+.

**Transmission**

* **5-speed manual transmission**
    * **Synchros worn out:** Over time, the synchronizers in the manual transmission can become worn, leading to difficulty shifting gears. Repairing or replacing the synchros typically costs $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **4-speed automatic transmission**
    * **Slipping transmission:** The transmission may slip or refuse to shift gears, indicating problems with the clutches or other internal components. Transmission rebuilds or replacements generally cost $2,500 - $4,000+.

**Suspension**

* **Front strut mounts:** The front strut mounts can deteriorate, causing clunking or rattling noises over bumps. Replacing the strut mounts usually costs between $600 - $1,000+.
* **Rear shock absorbers:** Worn rear shock absorbers can result in a rough ride and reduced handling stability. Replacing the shock absorbers typically costs $400 - $800+.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, leaving the vehicle unable to charge the battery. Replacing the alternator generally costs $700 - $1,200+.
* **Starter motor issues:** A faulty starter motor may prevent the engine from starting. Replacing the starter motor typically costs $500 - $900+.
* **Window regulators:** The window regulators can malfunction, causing the windows to become inoperable. Replacing the window regulators usually costs $300 - $600+ per window.
* **Central locking system malfunctions:** The central locking system may experience issues, such as door locks failing to unlock or lock. Repairing these issues generally costs $200 - $500+.

**Exterior**

* **Sunroof leaks:** The sunroof can develop leaks, allowing water to enter the interior. Repairing sunroof leaks typically costs $500 - $1,000+.
* **Trim pieces cracking:** The exterior trim pieces can crack or fade over time, detracting from the vehicle's appearance. Replacing the trim pieces generally costs $200 - $400+ per piece.

**Interior**

* **HVAC issues:** The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system may experience problems, such as reduced airflow or malfunctioning climate control. Repairing HVAC issues usually costs $500 - $1,000+.
* **Door panel clips breaking:** The plastic clips that hold the door panels in place can break, causing the panels to rattle or become loose. Replacing the door panel clips generally costs $100 - $200+.

**Summary:**

The 1993 Mercedes-Benz 190E is a well-engineered and reliable vehicle, but it is not without its share of issues. Some of the common problems, such as cracked cylinder heads and transmission issues, can be costly to repair. However, many of the other issues are relatively minor and can be resolved for a reasonable cost.
