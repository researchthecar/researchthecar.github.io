**Summary**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz C300 is a generally reliable vehicle, but certain issues are more prevalent than others. Electrical problems, particularly with the EIS and SAM modules, and transmission issues with the 7G-Tronic transmission can be costly to repair. Suspension components also show wear over time. While these issues can be significant, they are not necessarily present in every vehicle, and proper maintenance can mitigate some of these risks. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a used 2012 C300.
