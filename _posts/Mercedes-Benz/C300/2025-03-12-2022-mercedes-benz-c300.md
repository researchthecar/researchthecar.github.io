The 2022 Mercedes-Benz C300 marked the start of a new generation (W206) for the popular luxury sedan. The standard engine is a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. While other engine options were available in subsequent years, the 2022 model year primarily featured this engine. Owners often praise the C300 for its stylish interior, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. Some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the infotainment system and occasional glitches in the electronic systems.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M254)**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, shaking, check engine light illumination, diagnostic codes indicating misfires on one or more cylinders.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis can involve checking spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, and potentially the high-pressure fuel pump. Replacement of faulty components is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ depending on the affected component and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining or screeching noises from the engine bay, check engine light illumination, potentially accompanied by excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is essential. Replacement of the turbocharger is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic (725.0/9G-Tronic)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable jerkiness or abruptness during gear changes, especially at lower speeds. Can sometimes be accompanied by unusual noises during shifts.
    *   Solution: Initially, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may be attempted. If the problem persists, a more in-depth inspection of the transmission valve body or even replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (software update) - $3,000+ (valve body/transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into Drive or Reverse and the vehicle actually moving.
    *   Solution: Fluid level and condition should be checked first. Low fluid can cause delayed engagement. If the fluid is in good condition and at the proper level, internal transmission issues like valve body problems are likely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid top off) - $3,000+ (valve body/transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Creaking or Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noises coming from the suspension while driving over bumps or uneven surfaces, often noticeable at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the suspension components, focusing on bushings, ball joints, and sway bar links. Lubrication or replacement of worn parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per corner of the vehicle, depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX infotainment system becomes unresponsive, freezes, or crashes unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve the issue. In some cases, a system reset or replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (infotainment unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Errors or warnings related to parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, or other driver-assistance systems. Intermittent or persistent malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the malfunctioning sensor and recalibration if needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on location and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues (Sticking/Failure to Close)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may get stuck in the open or tilted position, or fail to close completely.
    *   Solution: Inspection and lubrication of the sunroof tracks and mechanism. Repair or replacement of faulty motors or other hardware.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Screen Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The coating on the dashboard screen starts to separate, creating bubbles or a peeling effect.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard screen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on if the dealer covers some of the cost.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Mercedes-Benz C300 can have a few potential issues, primarily related to the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. While some issues, like harsh shifting, might be resolved with software updates, others such as turbocharger failure or delamination, can be more costly. The severity and cost vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints.
