Some owners praise the car's build quality and sophisticated features, while others criticize its running costs and potential for expensive repairs as it ages.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, reduced engine performance, potential misfires. The camshaft adjuster solenoid is responsible for controlling oil flow to the camshaft adjusters, which in turn adjust valve timing. A failing solenoid can disrupt this process.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on labor costs and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve cover, burning oil smell, low oil level, and potential for smoke from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (7G-Tronic)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during light acceleration. Hesitation or delayed engagement when shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a software update can alleviate the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission stuck in gear, inability to shift, check engine light. The conductor plate houses the sensors and solenoids that control the transmission's operation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transmission conductor plate and fluid flush/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Vague steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side, depending on whether only the bushings or the entire control arm needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or groaning noises from the suspension when turning the steering wheel or going over bumps. Excessive bouncing or poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ per strut.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**

**Summary**

The 2010 Mercedes-Benz C300, while a desirable luxury sedan, is prone to certain issues as it ages. Engine-related problems such as camshaft adjuster solenoid and valve cover gasket leaks are common. The 7G-Tronic transmission can experience torque converter and conductor plate failures, which can be costly to repair. Suspension issues, electrical glitches, and sunroof malfunctions can also arise. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the component and the extent of the damage. Potential buyers should have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic to identify any pre-existing problems.
