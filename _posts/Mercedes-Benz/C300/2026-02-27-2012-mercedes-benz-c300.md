### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz C300 (W204) demonstrates a good overall reliability record, particularly for its powertrain. The 3.0L V6 engine is generally robust, though common issues like intake manifold runner flap actuator failures and oil leaks from gaskets/seals can occur and require attention. The 7G-TRONIC transmission is also largely dependable, but potential failures of the Transmission Control Module or torque converter can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical components like window regulators and HID headlight systems are the most frequently cited non-wear-and-tear issues. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically free from widespread problems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early warning signs are key to maintaining the C300's reliability and value.
