The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Maybach S580 represents the pinnacle of luxury and refinement within the Mercedes-Benz lineup. Powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 496 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC nine-speed automatic transmission, the S580 delivers effortless performance and unparalleled comfort. While celebrated for its opulent interior, advanced technology, and smooth ride, some owners have reported experiencing certain issues. A less powerful S500 model is available with a 3.0 liter Inline-6 Turbo engine producing 429 Horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. An even more powerful S680 is available with a 6.0 liter V12 engine producing 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. Common praises revolve around the spacious cabin, plush seating, and advanced driver-assistance features. Dissatisfaction often stems from the complexity of the infotainment system and occasional glitches in electronic components.
