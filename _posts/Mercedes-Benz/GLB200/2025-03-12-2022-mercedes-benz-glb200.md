The 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLB200 is a compact SUV known for its practicality, spacious interior (for its class), and Mercedes-Benz luxury. The GLB200 is equipped with a 1.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 163 horsepower and 250 Nm of torque. Other engine options available in the GLB range include the GLB250 (2.0-liter turbo-four) and AMG GLB35 (higher-output 2.0-liter turbo-four). A diesel engine is available in some markets. Transmission options typically consist of a 7-speed or 8-speed dual-clutch automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often praise the GLB's comfortable ride, versatile cargo space, and available third-row seating (though it's best suited for children). Common criticisms include the somewhat underpowered base engine (GLB200), the occasionally clunky dual-clutch transmission, and the higher price point compared to non-luxury competitors.
