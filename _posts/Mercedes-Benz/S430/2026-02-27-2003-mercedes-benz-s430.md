### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz S430 is a luxurious vehicle with a generally robust powertrain, but its complexity, particularly the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension and electronic systems, can lead to significant repair costs. Common issues include leaks within the ABC system, transmission problems like conductor plate failure, and various electrical gremlins stemming from modules like the SAM. Engine components like ignition coils and MAF sensors can also require attention. While the core V8 engine is reliable, the supporting systems demand diligent maintenance and a budget for potential repairs. Owners should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance expenses, especially concerning the advanced suspension and intricate electronics.
