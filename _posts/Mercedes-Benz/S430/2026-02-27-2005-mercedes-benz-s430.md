### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz S430 offers a luxurious experience but comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly in its advanced systems. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a common source of expensive repairs due to hydraulic leaks and component failures. The electrical system, especially the SAM units and instrument cluster, can also present issues. While the engine and transmission are generally robust, specific leaks and control module problems can arise. Interior components like headliners and seat controls are also noted for occasional failures. Prospective buyers should be prepared for higher maintenance costs and the possibility of significant repairs, especially if the ABC suspension has not been meticulously maintained or recently serviced.
