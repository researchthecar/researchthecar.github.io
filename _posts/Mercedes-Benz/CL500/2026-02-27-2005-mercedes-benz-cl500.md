### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Mercedes-Benz CL500 is a capable luxury coupe, but its advanced technology and age mean potential for significant repair costs. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system and the complex electrical systems, particularly the SAM units, are the most common sources of expensive issues. Engine and transmission reliability are generally good for the powertrain itself, but associated components like intake manifold gaskets and conductor plates can fail. Owners should budget for potential repairs, especially concerning the suspension and electronics, and ensure regular maintenance is performed by qualified technicians to mitigate risks.
