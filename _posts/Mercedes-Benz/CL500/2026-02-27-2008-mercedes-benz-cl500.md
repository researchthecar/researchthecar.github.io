### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CL500 offers a luxurious driving experience but requires diligent maintenance and awareness of potential age-related issues. The most common concerns revolve around the complex Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, requiring significant investment for repairs like hydraulic leaks or pump failures. Engine reliability is generally good, but ignition coil failures and oil cooler seal leaks can occur. The transmission, while robust, may experience issues with its control module or conductor plate. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM module and Keyless Go system, are not uncommon. Interior electronics, such as the COMAND system and climate control actuators, can also develop faults. Despite these potential drawbacks, with proper care and prompt attention to issues, the CL500 can remain a capable and enjoyable vehicle.
