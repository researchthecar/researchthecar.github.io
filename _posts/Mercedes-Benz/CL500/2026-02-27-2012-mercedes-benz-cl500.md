### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CL500 offers a luxurious and powerful driving experience, but potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The engine, particularly the M278 V8, can experience timing chain wear and oil leaks, requiring significant repair costs. The 7G-Tronic transmission may develop issues with the torque converter or valve body, leading to shifting problems. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a complex system prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be very expensive to fix. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and infotainment glitches, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, the mechanical and electrical components require diligent maintenance and a budget for potential repairs to ensure long-term reliability.
