### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mercedes-Benz CL500 is a luxurious and powerful coupe, but its advanced technology and age mean potential for significant repair costs. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a notable area for potential expense, with hydraulic leaks and pump failures being common. The 5.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but ignition coils and oil cooler seals can be points of concern. Electrical issues, particularly with the BCM and instrument cluster, are also frequently reported. Transmission issues, especially with the 5-speed automatic, can arise from TCM or conductor plate problems. While not a vehicle for the budget-conscious owner, diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly can help maintain its grand touring capabilities.
