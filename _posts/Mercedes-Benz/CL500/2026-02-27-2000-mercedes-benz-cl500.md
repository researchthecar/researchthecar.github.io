### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mercedes-Benz CL500 is a luxurious and powerful coupe, but its advanced technology and complex systems mean potential for costly repairs as it ages. The V8 engine is generally robust, but ignition coils and MAF sensors can be points of concern. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while durable, is known for conductor plate issues. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a significant potential expense due to leaks and pump failures. Electrical components, particularly window regulators and instrument clusters, also require attention. Regular, diligent maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are critical for mitigating reliability concerns and managing ownership costs for this sophisticated vehicle.
