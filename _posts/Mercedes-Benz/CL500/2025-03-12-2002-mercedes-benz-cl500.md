The 2002 Mercedes-Benz CL500 is a luxurious grand tourer known for its elegant styling, powerful engine, and advanced technology for its time. It came standard with a 5.0L V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options included a V12 engine in the CL600. Owners generally praise the car for its comfortable ride, sophisticated features (such as Active Body Control), and powerful engine. Common complaints often revolve around the high cost of maintenance and repairs, especially concerning the complex hydraulic suspension system and electrical components.

**Engine**

**5.0L V8**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations on the engine, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, rear main seal, and oil filter housing. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is the typical solution. For more severe leaks, the source must be properly identified and addressed with the appropriate repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine mounts can fail, causing excessive engine vibration, noise, and movement, especially during acceleration and deceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed engine mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed automatic transmission (722.6) can experience slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, and a general lack of responsiveness. This can be due to low transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or internal wear.
    *   Solution: A transmission service, including a fluid and filter change, may resolve minor issues. However, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary for more severe problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Active Body Control (ABC) System Leaks/Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Active Body Control (ABC) system, responsible for maintaining a level ride height and minimizing body roll, is prone to leaks in the hydraulic lines, struts, and pump. Symptoms include a sagging suspension, warning lights on the dashboard, and a rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking components, such as hydraulic lines, struts, or the pump. Flushing the ABC system with fresh fluid is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per strut, $200 - $500+ for hydraulic lines, $1,000 - $3,000+ for the pump.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABC Accumulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC accumulators (or spheres) store hydraulic pressure for the ABC system. They can fail over time, leading to a stiff or bouncy ride, and eventual ABC system failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed accumulators. There are typically two main accumulators (front and rear) and smaller ones near the valve blocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per accumulator.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CL500 can suffer from parasitic battery drain, causing the battery to die overnight or within a few days of sitting. This can be caused by a faulty module, a relay that is stuck on, or an aftermarket accessory that is not properly installed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the battery drain and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the instrument cluster display can fail, making it difficult to read information such as the odometer, trip meter, and warning messages.
    *   Solution: Replacing the instrument cluster or having the display repaired by a specialized repair shop.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can fail, causing the sunroof to get stuck, open or close improperly, or make excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the sunroof motor, cables, or tracks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the climate control system can include failure of the blower motor, malfunctioning blend door actuators (resulting in temperature inconsistencies), and compressor failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blower motor, blend door actuators, or compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2002 Mercedes-Benz CL500 offers a luxurious driving experience but is prone to several issues that can be costly to repair. The most significant concerns involve the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, electrical gremlins, and potential transmission problems. Engine issues, such as oil leaks, are also common. Overall, the severity and cost of these potential problems are relatively high, making thorough inspection and a comprehensive maintenance history crucial before purchasing.
