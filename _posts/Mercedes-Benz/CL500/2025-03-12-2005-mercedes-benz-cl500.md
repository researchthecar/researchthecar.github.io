The 2005 Mercedes-Benz CL500 is a luxury coupe that offers a blend of performance and comfort. The standard engine is a 5.0L V8 producing 302 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful CL600 model was also available with a V12 engine. For the CL500, many owners appreciate the smooth ride, luxurious interior, and powerful engine. However, the complex electronics and air suspension can be prone to issues, leading to potentially high repair costs. Reliability ratings from J.D. Power were below average when the car was new, and this has generally continued as the vehicles have aged.
