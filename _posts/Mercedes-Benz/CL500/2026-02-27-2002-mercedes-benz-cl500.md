### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz CL500 is a luxurious and powerful coupe, but its complexity means potential buyers should be prepared for maintenance costs. The V8 engine is generally robust, but age-related leaks from oil cooler seals and intake manifold gaskets are common. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while durable, can suffer from conductor plate issues. The most significant potential expense lies in the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, which is prone to leaks and component failures. Electrical issues, particularly with the instrument cluster and SAM modules, are also notable. While not a budget vehicle to maintain, addressing these known issues can ensure continued enjoyment of this sophisticated grand tourer.
