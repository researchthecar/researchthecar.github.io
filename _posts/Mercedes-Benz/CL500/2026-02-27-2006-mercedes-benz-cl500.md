### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz CL500 offers a luxurious and powerful driving experience, but potential owners should be aware of its specific reliability concerns. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a notable area for potential costly repairs due to hydraulic leaks and pump failures. Engine-wise, the 5.0L V8 is generally robust, but coolant and oil leaks from common points like intake manifolds and valve covers can occur. Transmission issues, particularly with the 5-speed automatic, often involve the control module or conductor plate. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and keyless entry system faults, are also reported. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, specific components like climate control actuators can fail. Regular, thorough pre-purchase inspections and a budget for potential premium repairs are highly recommended for this model.
