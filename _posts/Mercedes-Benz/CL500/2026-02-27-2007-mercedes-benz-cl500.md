Electrical gremlins, especially related to the SAM modules, are also a notable concern. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, the advanced systems require diligent maintenance and can be expensive to repair when issues arise. Owners should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance costs, especially if they encounter problems with the ABC system or transmission.
