### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz R320, particularly with its 3.0L V6 diesel engine, presents a mixed reliability profile. Common concerns revolve around the diesel emissions system (DPF, EGR), glow plugs, and potential transmission issues like torque converter or valve body problems. Suspension components, especially air suspension if equipped, can also require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as sensor failures and window regulators, are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of these specific mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a history of diligent maintenance are crucial for mitigating these risks.
