**Engine**

**3.0L V6 Diesel (OM642)**

* **Oil Cooler Seal Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common from the oil cooler seals located within the "V" of the engine. Symptoms include oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil level.
    * Solution: Replacement of the oil cooler seals. This is often a labor-intensive job due to the location of the cooler.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Swirl Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The swirl flaps inside the intake manifold help control airflow. The swirl motor, which actuates these flaps, is prone to failure. Symptoms include a check engine light, poor performance, and potential limp mode.
    * Solution: Replacement of the swirl motor or, in some cases, the entire intake manifold. Some owners opt for a delete kit, though this may not be legal in all areas.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Valve Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve can become clogged with carbon buildup, leading to poor engine performance, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6 Gasoline (M272)**
