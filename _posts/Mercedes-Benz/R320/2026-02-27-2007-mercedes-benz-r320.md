### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz R320, particularly with its diesel engine, presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.0L V6 diesel engine is prone to issues with injectors, EGR valves, and turbochargers, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can also experience problems with its control module and valve body. Optional air suspension systems are a known weak point, with leaks and compressor failures being common. Electrical gremlins, often related to sensor failures, can also arise. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of the significant repair costs associated with the powertrain and optional air suspension. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for managing the long-term reliability of this luxury crossover.
