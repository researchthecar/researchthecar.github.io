### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz R320, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.0L V6 turbo diesel engine, though powerful, is susceptible to issues with its Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), glow plugs, and intake manifold runner flaps, which can be costly to repair. The optional air suspension can also develop leaks over time. Electrical gremlins, particularly with sensors and the infotainment system, are not uncommon. However, the transmission and general interior/exterior components tend to be more robust. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential diesel-specific and electrical issues and factor in potential maintenance costs beyond routine servicing.
