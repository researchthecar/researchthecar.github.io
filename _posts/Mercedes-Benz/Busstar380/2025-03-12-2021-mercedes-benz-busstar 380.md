The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Busstar 380 is a large capacity bus intended for passenger transport. While specific engine options and power outputs are often tailored to regional markets, the Busstar is typically equipped with a Mercedes-Benz diesel engine, often a variant of the OM936 or OM470 series. These engines could range from around 299 horsepower (220 kW) and 885 lb-ft of torque to higher outputs depending on the specific configuration. Transmission options typically include automatic gearboxes from ZF or Mercedes-Benz, commonly the ZF Ecolife series. Operators appreciate the Busstar for its reliability, passenger capacity, and Mercedes-Benz build quality, while some may find its fuel consumption and maintenance costs to be higher compared to competitors.
