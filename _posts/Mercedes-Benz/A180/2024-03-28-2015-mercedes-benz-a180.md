**Introduction:**

The 2015 Mercedes-Benz A180 is a luxury subcompact hatchback powered by a 1.6L inline-4 turbocharged engine mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Notable for its stylish design, fuel efficiency, and advanced technology, it is also prone to some specific issues.

**Engine**

* **1.6L Inline-4 Turbocharged Engine**
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** Premature wear on the turbocharger bearings leads to reduced boost pressure or complete failure. Symptoms include loss of power, increased fuel consumption, and noise from the engine bay. Solution involves replacing the turbocharger assembly; estimated cost: $1,500 - $3,000.
    * **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** A faulty tensioner can lead to a loose timing chain, causing engine timing issues, rough idling, and reduced performance. Replacing the timing chain and tensioner is necessary; estimated cost: $800 - $1,500.
    * **Fuel Injector Issues:** Clogged or faulty fuel injectors can result in misfires, engine hesitation, and poor fuel economy. Cleaning or replacing the injectors is typically required; estimated cost: $400 - $800 per injector.

**Transmission**

* **7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)**
    * **Clutch Pack Wear:** Premature wear on the clutch packs leads to slippage, shuddering, or difficulty shifting. Replacing the clutch pack assembly is required; estimated cost: $2,500 - $4,000.
    * **Mechatronic Unit Failure:** A faulty mechatronic unit can cause transmission control issues, leading to erratic shifting, transmission slipping, or even complete failure. Replacing the mechatronic unit is necessary; estimated cost: $1,500 - $3,000.

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure:** Worn or torn bushings in the front control arms can lead to excessive play in the suspension, causing clunking noises and poor handling. Replacing the bushings is required; estimated cost: $400 - $800 per side.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge:** A faulty alternator or battery can lead to premature battery discharge, resulting in difficulty starting the vehicle or complete electrical failure. Replacing the alternator or battery is typically required; estimated cost: $500 - $1,000.
* **Electrical Module Failure:** Issues with electrical modules, such as the body control module or engine control module, can cause various electrical malfunctions, including flickering lights, instrument cluster errors, or even engine problems. Diagnosing and replacing the faulty module is necessary; estimated cost: $500 - $1,500+.
