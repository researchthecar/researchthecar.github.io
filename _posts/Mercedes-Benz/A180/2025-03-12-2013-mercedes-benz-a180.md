The 2013 Mercedes-Benz A180 is a compact hatchback known for its stylish design, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. The A180 is powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine producing around 122 horsepower and 200 Nm of torque. Other engine options included a 1.5-liter diesel, a 1.8-liter diesel, and a more powerful 2.0-liter petrol engine. Transmission options were a 6-speed manual and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic (7G-DCT). Owners generally appreciate the A180's premium feel and relatively low running costs, but some common complaints involve electrical issues, suspension problems, and occasional transmission hiccups.
