**Summary**
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz E450 presents a mix of potential issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. Electrical issues, particularly with the MBUX system, are a common annoyance. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger issues, while less frequent, can lead to substantial repair costs. Similarly, transmission problems such as rough shifting can be costly to resolve, especially if a valve body or torque converter replacement is required. Air suspension failures, if equipped, can add to the maintenance burden. While not every E450 will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor them into their purchasing decision.
