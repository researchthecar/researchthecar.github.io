The 2022 Mercedes-Benz E450 is a luxury sedan praised for its comfortable ride, refined interior, and advanced technology. It comes standard with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine with mild hybrid assist, producing 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the smooth power delivery and fuel efficiency of this engine. Others, however, express concerns about electrical glitches and the complexity of the infotainment system. The E450 is exclusively paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Other E-Class models offer different engines, including a less powerful 2.0L Turbo I4 engine and an AMG enhanced 3.0L Turbo I6 engine.

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 with Mild Hybrid Assist (M256)**

*   **Rough Idle/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a rough idle or hesitation upon acceleration, particularly when the engine is cold. This may be linked to the mild hybrid system or fuel delivery.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to pinpoint the cause. The solution may involve reprogramming the engine control unit (ECU), replacing fuel injectors, or addressing issues with the mild hybrid system's components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+, depending on the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Increased Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported an increase in oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil changes.
    *   Solution: Inspect for leaks, perform a compression test, and check for valve seal issues. Replacing valve seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic (9G-Tronic)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during lower gear changes. Hesitation when accelerating from a stop has also been noted.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and software update on the transmission control module (TCM). If the problem persists, inspect the valve body for contamination or damage. Valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the repair required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips when shifting gears, causing a loss of power and a delay in acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body or entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some vehicles equipped with the optional air suspension have experienced failures, resulting in the vehicle sitting unevenly or failing to maintain proper ride height.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the failing component (air strut, compressor, valve block). Replacement of the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ per strut, compressor replacement is separate.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches/Freezing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX infotainment system can experience glitches, freezing, or unresponsiveness. Software updates may temporarily resolve the issue, but it often returns.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets. In some cases, the entire infotainment unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $2,000+ (unit replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions with parking sensors or blind spot monitoring systems. These sensors may provide false alerts or fail to detect objects.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the faulty sensor. Sensor replacement and recalibration.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify parasitic draws. Repair or replacement of the faulty component causing the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+
