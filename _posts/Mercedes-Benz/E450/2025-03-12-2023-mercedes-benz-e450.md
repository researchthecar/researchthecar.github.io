The 2023 Mercedes-Benz E450 is a popular luxury sedan known for its refined driving experience, advanced technology, and elegant interior. The E450 is powered by a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbo engine with mild hybrid drive, producing 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally praise the E450 for its comfortable ride, luxurious features, and powerful engine, some common complaints arise regarding the advanced technology, electrical systems, and occasionally, the engine and transmission. Other engine options for the 2023 E-Class include the E350 powered by a 2.0L Inline-4 turbo engine and the AMG E53 powered by an AMG-enhanced 3.0L Inline-6 turbo engine.

**Electrical**

* **MBUX System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) system, responsible for infotainment, navigation, and vehicle settings, may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash entirely. This can occur randomly or during specific functions like using navigation or connecting a smartphone.
    * Solution: A software update from the dealership is often required to resolve the issue. In some cases, a full system reset or replacement of the MBUX unit might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (MBUX unit replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Wireless Charging Pad Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The wireless charging pad for smartphones may fail to charge devices consistently or stop working altogether.
    * Solution: Check the placement of the phone and ensure it is compatible with the charging pad. If the issue persists, the charging pad module might need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors or blind spot monitoring systems may produce false alarms, fail to detect objects, or become completely inoperative.
    * Solution: Check the sensors for dirt or obstructions. If clean, a diagnostic scan may be required to identify faulty sensors, wiring, or control modules. Replacement of the affected component is usually necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the sensor and location)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**3.0L Inline-6 Turbo (M256)**

* **Mild Hybrid System (48V Battery) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 48V mild hybrid system, which assists with fuel efficiency and provides a boost during acceleration, may experience issues with the battery or related components. Symptoms can include warning lights, reduced engine performance, or failure of the auto start/stop system.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the 48V system is required to identify the faulty component (battery, control module, or wiring). Replacement or repair of the affected part is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the component)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9G-TRONIC 9-Speed Automatic (9G-Tronic)**

* **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 9G-TRONIC transmission may exhibit rough or delayed shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can be more noticeable during cold starts or under heavy acceleration.
    * Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission flush or valve body replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (valve body replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof/Moonroof Rattling or Squeaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof or moonroof may rattle or squeak when driving over uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: Lubricating the sunroof tracks and seals may temporarily alleviate the noise. In some cases, adjustment or replacement of the sunroof mechanism may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the severity and required repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Seat Creaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The leather or leatherette seats can creak when going around corners.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the severity and required repair)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicles equipped with the optional air suspension may experience issues such as sagging, uneven ride height, or failure to maintain proper inflation. This can be caused by leaks in the air struts or problems with the air compressor.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the air suspension system is required to identify the leaking struts, faulty compressor, or other related components. Replacement of the affected parts is usually necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (per strut)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Mercedes-Benz E450 is generally a reliable luxury vehicle, but some owners have reported issues with the electrical system (particularly the MBUX system), mild hybrid system, and transmission. Suspension issues are usually only applicable on vehicles equipped with the optional air suspension. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely. Software updates often address the MBUX and transmission issues, but component replacements can be expensive, especially for the air suspension and 48V hybrid system components. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and inquire about service history and warranty coverage before purchasing.
