The 2020 Mercedes-Benz E450 is a mid-size luxury car praised for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and advanced technology. Available as a sedan, coupe, convertible, and wagon, it offers a variety of choices for discerning buyers. The E450 is equipped with a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine producing 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 in the E350 and a more powerful AMG-enhanced V8 in the AMG E63 S. All engine options are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the E450's smooth powertrain, luxurious appointments, and sophisticated styling. However, some have reported issues with the car's complex infotainment system and occasional electrical glitches.

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning MBUX System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment system can freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. The voice control might not work correctly, and the screen may display glitches or error messages.
    *   Solution: Restarting the system can sometimes resolve the issue. A software update from the dealership is often required. In some cases, the MBUX head unit may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200+ (for software updates), $1000 - $2000+ (for head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery drains quickly, especially if left parked for a few days. This can lead to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Identifying the parasitic drain is key. A faulty module (e.g., infotainment, telematics) may be drawing power when the car is off. Diagnosis and repair of the faulty module are necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (diagnosis), $200 - $1000+ (repair depending on the module)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors may give false alarms or fail to detect obstacles. Blind spot monitoring might malfunction or become disabled.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor is usually the solution. Recalibration of the system may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per sensor, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Rattling/Creaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may produce rattling or creaking noises, especially when driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the sunroof seals and tracks can sometimes alleviate the noise. In some cases, the sunroof assembly may need adjustment or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (lubrication/adjustment), $500 - $1500+ (sunroof assembly replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Squeaks/Rattles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaks and rattles may emanate from the dashboard, particularly around the air vents or instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise is crucial. Adding felt pads or foam insulation can sometimes dampen the sound. In more severe cases, the dashboard components may need to be disassembled and reassembled.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Adaptive Headlight Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The adaptive headlights may fail to adjust properly, resulting in poor visibility or error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Check the headlight aiming and ensure the sensors are clean and undamaged. In some instances, the headlight control module may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (diagnosis/adjustment), $500 - $1500+ (control module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**3.0L Turbocharged V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (9G-Tronic)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission shifts may be jerky or abrupt, especially during low-speed acceleration or deceleration.
    * Solution: A software update or transmission fluid flush might resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$200+ (software update), $300-$500+ (fluid flush), $1000-$3000+ (valve body replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension (if equipped) may leak, causing the car to sag or fail to maintain the correct ride height. The air compressor may also fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air strut or the faulty air compressor is necessary. Inspecting and replacing air lines may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (per strut), $500 - $1500+ (air compressor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Mercedes-Benz E450 is generally a reliable luxury vehicle, but owners have reported issues with the MBUX infotainment system, electrical components, interior rattles, and, if equipped, the air suspension. The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor annoyances while others require more extensive and costly repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchasing.
