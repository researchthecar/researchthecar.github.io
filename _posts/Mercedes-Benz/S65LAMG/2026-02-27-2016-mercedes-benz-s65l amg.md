### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz S65L AMG is a remarkably engineered vehicle with a strong reliability record for its class. The V12 engine, while powerful, can present specific issues like ignition coil failures and turbocharger concerns, which are costly to repair but not necessarily widespread. The advanced Active Body Control suspension is a potential source of hydraulic leaks and pump failures, demanding attention and significant expense. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment and sensor systems, can occur but are often resolvable with software updates or component replacement. Overall, for a vehicle of this caliber, reliability is good, but owners must budget for premium maintenance and potential repairs, especially as the vehicle ages.
