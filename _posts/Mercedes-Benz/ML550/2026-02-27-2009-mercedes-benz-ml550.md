### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz ML550 offers a potent blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 5.5L V8 engine can experience problems with the intake manifold runner flap actuators and oil cooler leaks. The 7G-Tronic transmission is susceptible to valve body malfunctions and torque converter issues, which can be costly to repair. Optional air suspension systems are prone to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM unit, and interior components like seat modules and panoramic sunroofs can also require attention. While the standard suspension and exterior are generally robust, proactive maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended to mitigate potential repair costs.
