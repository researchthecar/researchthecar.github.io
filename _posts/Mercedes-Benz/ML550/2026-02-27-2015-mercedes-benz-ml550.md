While the powertrain is generally robust, potential owners should be aware of possible issues with the twin-turbo V8 engine, particularly concerning turbochargers and oil leaks. The 7-speed automatic transmission can also experience leaks or torque converter problems. For models equipped with the AIRMATIC air suspension, leaks in air springs or compressor failure are notable concerns.
