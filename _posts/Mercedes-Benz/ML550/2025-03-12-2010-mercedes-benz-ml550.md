**Summary:**

The 2010 Mercedes-Benz ML550 can be a desirable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Airmatic suspension problems and electrical issues (especially SAM module failure) can be costly to repair. The 7G-Tronic transmission may also require maintenance or repairs. Oil leaks from the engine are not uncommon, requiring attention to prevent further damage. While some issues may be minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite substantial. Due to these potential repair costs, a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
