*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly occur from the valve cover gaskets and the oil cooler lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets and/or oil cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the source of the leak and if you are using OEM or aftermarket parts.

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light are common symptoms of failing ignition coils. The V12 engine has 12 ignition coils, and individual failures can occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per coil including labor.

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, whistling noises, and smoke from the exhaust can indicate turbocharger problems. Issues can range from worn bearings to failed seals.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the affected turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and parts.

**Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rough or delayed shifting, particularly when the transmission is cold. This can manifest as harsh upshifts or downshifts.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. In more severe cases, valve body repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+ depending on the complexity of the problem

**Suspension**

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) System Leaks/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC system is prone to leaks, leading to suspension sagging, uneven ride height, and warning messages on the dashboard. This is due to the high pressures involved.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair leaks in the system, which may involve replacing hydraulic lines, accumulators, or the pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and parts required. Complete system overhauls can be significantly more expensive.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur due to various electrical components not shutting down properly or parasitic draws.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the battery drain. This may involve tracing wiring, replacing faulty modules, or addressing issues with the vehicle's computer system.
