### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG is a pinnacle of automotive engineering, offering exhilarating performance. While generally reliable for its class, potential owners should be aware of specific, albeit not widespread, issues. The V12 engine, while powerful, can experience issues with turbocharger components and ignition coils. The sophisticated 7-speed transmission may encounter torque converter or TCM problems. The advanced Active Body Control suspension is prone to hydraulic leaks or pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and various sensors, can also arise. The complex retractable hardtop mechanism requires maintenance, and interior climate control actuators can fail. Despite these potential concerns, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging issues, the SL65 AMG can provide a rewarding ownership experience.
