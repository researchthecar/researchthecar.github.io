**Engine**

**6.0L Twin-Turbo V12 (M275)**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, check engine light. This engine is known for experiencing coil pack failures, particularly as it ages.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty coil pack(s). Replacing all 12 at once is often recommended to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per coil pack (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) Pump Failure/Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power steering, suspension issues, warning lights on the dashboard, fluid leaks. Although technically part of the suspension system, the ABC pump is driven by the engine and its failure directly impacts engine performance due to the load it places.
    *   Solution: Replace the ABC pump and flush the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling or other unusual noises from the engine bay, excessive smoke from the exhaust, check engine light. The twin turbochargers can experience wear and tear over time.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ per turbo (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Transmission Slippage/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed engagement, slipping between gears, rough or jerky shifting, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Transmission service (fluid and filter change) may resolve minor issues. More severe problems may require valve body repair/replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 (service), $1,500 - $4,000+ (repair/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) Strut Failure/Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, uneven ride height, fluid leaks, warning lights on the dashboard. The ABC system is prone to leaks and strut failures.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking ABC struts. It's often recommended to replace struts in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ per strut (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) System Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low fluid levels, warning messages, hissing sounds, visible leaks near the ABC components.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair or replace leaking hoses, valve blocks, or pulsation dampers. Flushing the system is recommended after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery after short periods of inactivity. The SL65 AMG has a complex electrical system, which can lead to parasitic drain.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the drain. Common culprits include faulty control modules, aftermarket electronics, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: The roof may not open or close properly, stops mid-cycle, or displays error messages. This is a complex hydraulic system.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the malfunction, which could include faulty sensors, hydraulic pump issues, or problems with the latching mechanisms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Retractable Hardtop Seal Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, especially during rain or car washes.

**Summary:**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG offers exhilarating performance, but it comes with potential ownership costs reflecting its complex engineering. Common issues include coil pack failures, ABC suspension problems (leaks and pump failures), turbocharger issues, and electrical issues. These problems can range from relatively minor to quite expensive, with some repairs exceeding several thousand dollars. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Mercedes-Benz mechanic.
