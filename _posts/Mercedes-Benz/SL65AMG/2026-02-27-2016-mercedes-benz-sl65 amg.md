### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG is a remarkable performance vehicle, but its complexity and high-output V12 engine mean potential for significant repair costs. Key areas to monitor include the Active Body Control suspension system for leaks and pump issues, the twin-turbo V12 engine for ignition and turbocharger problems, and the transmission's control module. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, can also arise. The retractable hardtop mechanism is another area where mechanical failures can occur. While not plagued by widespread, common failures, owners should be prepared for the possibility of expensive repairs, especially as the vehicle ages. Regular, specialized maintenance is crucial for mitigating these risks.
