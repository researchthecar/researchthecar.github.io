The 2019 Mercedes-Benz E53 AMG is a performance-oriented variant of the E-Class, boasting a potent combination of luxury and athleticism. The E53 is powered by a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 engine paired with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system (EQ Boost). This configuration delivers 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed through a 9-speed automatic transmission (9G-TRONIC). Owners often praise the E53 for its smooth power delivery, agile handling, and luxurious interior. Criticisms often revolve around the sometimes-complex infotainment system and the potential for higher maintenance costs associated with the AMG performance enhancements.
