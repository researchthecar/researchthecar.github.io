### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz GL320, particularly with its diesel engine, presents a mixed reliability profile. The 3.0L V6 turbo diesel (OM642) is prone to issues with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), glow plugs, and intake manifold runners, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can also experience leaks and valve body problems. The optional AIRMATIC suspension is a common source of complaints due to leaks and compressor failures. While the standard suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are generally more reliable, potential buyers should be aware of these specific diesel powertrain and air suspension vulnerabilities. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating these potential issues.
