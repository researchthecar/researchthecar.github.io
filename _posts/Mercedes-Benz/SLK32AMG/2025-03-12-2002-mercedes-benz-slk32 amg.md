The 2002 Mercedes-Benz SLK32 AMG is a high-performance roadster known for its potent supercharged engine and sporty handling. There was only one engine and transmission option available for this model, the 3.2L Supercharged V6 with 349 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise its acceleration and unique driving experience, but some criticize the dated interior and potential for higher maintenance costs compared to non-AMG models.

**Engine**

**3.2L Supercharged V6**

*   **Intercooler Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intercooler pump, responsible for cooling the air entering the engine, can fail. Symptoms include reduced engine performance, especially in hot weather, and potential overheating. A check engine light may illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intercooler pump with an updated version or a higher-performance aftermarket pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor can fail, leading to engine stalling, rough running, or a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Supercharger Clutch Relay**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The supercharger clutch relay can fail which will cause the supercharger not to kick in when it should. This may also cause the supercharger to be constantly engaged when it shouldn't be.
    *   Solution: Replacing the supercharger clutch relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate inside the transmission can develop electrical faults, leading to erratic shifting, limp mode (limited gear selection), or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the conductor plate and potentially the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Fluid Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks can develop from the transmission pan gasket or the electrical connector sleeve. Low fluid levels can cause shifting problems.
    *   Solution: Replacing the pan gasket and/or the electrical connector sleeve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Lower Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front lower ball joints are known to fail prematurely, leading to clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and potential handling issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Suspension Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various suspension bushings, especially in the control arms, can wear out, resulting in loose handling, clunking noises, and vibrations.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the specific bushing and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **K40 Relay Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The K40 relay module controls several critical engine and fuel injection functions. Failure can cause a variety of symptoms, including no-start conditions, fuel pump issues, and intermittent engine problems.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the K40 relay module. Sometimes re-soldering the existing module can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Pixel Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Pixels in the instrument cluster display can fade or disappear, making it difficult to read important information.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the instrument cluster. There are services that specialize in pixel repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Brake Light Switch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the brake light switch can cause the brake lights to stay on constantly, or not activate at all. This can also affect the cruise control and potentially cause transmission shifting issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the brake light switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Convertible Top Hydraulic System Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hydraulic system that operates the convertible top can develop leaks, leading to slow or incomplete top operation. The hydraulic pump is located in the trunk.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the leaking hydraulic cylinders or hoses.

**Summary**

The 2002 Mercedes-Benz SLK32 AMG, while a desirable performance vehicle, can suffer from several age-related issues. Engine problems like intercooler pump and crankshaft position sensor failures are common, along with conductor plate issues in the transmission. Suspension components, especially the lower ball joints and bushings, are prone to wear. Electrical problems can arise from the K40 relay module and instrument cluster. The convertible top hydraulic system is also a potential source of leaks. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, making thorough inspection and maintenance crucial for ownership. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potential safety hazards, so addressing them promptly is essential.
