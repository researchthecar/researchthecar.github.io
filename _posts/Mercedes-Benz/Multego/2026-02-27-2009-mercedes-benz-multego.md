### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz Multego demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its powertrain and chassis components, which are built for demanding commercial use. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the operational environment, such as turbocharger and EGR system problems on the diesel engines, and wear on the clutch for manual transmissions. Suspension components, especially the air springs, can require attention due to constant load and use. Electrical system issues, often stemming from wiring harness wear, are also noted. While interior components may show signs of wear, they are generally durable. Proactive maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly are key to ensuring the continued longevity and performance of the Multego.
