The 2007 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (marketed as the "Multego" by some converters/upfitters, though that's not an official Mercedes-Benz name) is a popular choice for conversion vans, RVs, and commercial vehicles. While specific configurations varied greatly depending on the upfitter, the most common engine option was the 3.0L V6 diesel engine, producing around 154 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Some early models may have had the 2.7L inline-5 diesel. Generally, owners appreciated the Sprinter's spaciousness, fuel economy (for its size), and driving dynamics. Common complaints included the cost of maintenance, certain reliability issues, and some aspects of the interior. The Sprinter came with an automatic transmission.
