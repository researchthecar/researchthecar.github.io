The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, also known as the Multego in some markets, is a popular van known for its versatility and practicality. It was offered with a few engine options, including diesel variants. One common diesel engine was the 2.7L Inline-5 cylinder diesel engine, producing around 154 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate its spacious cargo area and fuel efficiency (for a van), but some common complaints include electrical issues and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.7L Inline-5 Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, difficulty starting, black smoke from the exhaust, and decreased fuel economy. Can be caused by contaminated fuel or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). Ensure the fuel system is clean and free of contaminants.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector, depending on the shop and parts used.

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noise from the engine bay, loss of power, and potential for the engine to go into limp mode. Can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or general wear.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for damage and replace it if necessary. Check oil supply lines to the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+, depending on whether a new or remanufactured turbo is used.

    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be required, potentially leading to a valve body rebuild or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a fluid flush and filter change. $800 - $1500+ for valve body repair. $3,000 - $6,000+ for a transmission replacement.

**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Multego) can be a reliable workhorse, but like any vehicle of its age, it's prone to certain issues. The diesel engine, while durable, can suffer from fuel injector and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also common. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be significant and expensive. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potential maintenance costs.
