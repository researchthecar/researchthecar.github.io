The 2006 Mercedes-Benz Viano (also known as the Vito or Metris in some markets) is a versatile van often used for passenger transport. While not specifically a "Multego," which is usually associated with MAN buses, the Viano/Vito serves a similar function for smaller groups. Engine options typically include a range of inline-4 and V6 gasoline and diesel engines. A popular engine is the 3.0L V6 CDI diesel engine, producing around 204 horsepower and 324 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and Mercedes-Benz build quality. Common complaints revolve around maintenance costs, electrical issues, and rust susceptibility in certain climates.
