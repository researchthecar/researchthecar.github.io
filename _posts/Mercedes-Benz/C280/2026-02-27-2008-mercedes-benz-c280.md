### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz C280 offers a premium experience but comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly related to its M272 engine (intake manifold, balance shaft) and the 7G-TRONIC transmission (valve body, torque converter). Electrical issues, often stemming from the SAM module, can also arise. While the suspension and exterior are generally robust, interior components like sunroof drains and HVAC resistors can require attention. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher repair costs associated with luxury vehicles, especially for engine and transmission work. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating these issues.
