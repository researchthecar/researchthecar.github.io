### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz C280 offers a premium driving experience but comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly related to its M272 engine's balance shaft gear and intake manifold, and the 722.6 transmission's electronic components. Electrical gremlins, such as CAN bus issues and window regulators, are also noted. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out. While not inherently unreliable, owners should be prepared for potentially costly repairs in these specific areas. Regular and thorough maintenance, especially fluid changes for the engine and transmission, is crucial for mitigating some of these issues. Despite these points, many owners find the C280 to be a rewarding vehicle when properly maintained.
