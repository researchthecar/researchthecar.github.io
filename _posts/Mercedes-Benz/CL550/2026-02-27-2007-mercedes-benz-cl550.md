### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz CL550 offers a luxurious and powerful driving experience, but potential owners should be aware of its specific reliability concerns. The most common areas requiring attention are the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, which can be costly to repair due to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, and the 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic), which may experience issues with the valve body or torque converter. Engine-related concerns include potential failures of the intake manifold runner flaps and wear on the timing chain. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM unit and Keyless Go system, can also arise. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, specific electronic comfort features can sometimes falter. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these known problem areas are crucial for maintaining the CL550's performance and value.
