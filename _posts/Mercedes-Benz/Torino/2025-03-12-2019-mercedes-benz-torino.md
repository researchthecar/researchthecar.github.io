The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Metris (Torino is not a Mercedes-Benz model) is a versatile van offering a blend of utility and Mercedes-Benz refinement. The Metris is powered by a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 gasoline engine producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine is mated to a 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Metris's maneuverability, fuel efficiency for its class, and cargo capacity. Some common dislikes include the relatively basic interior compared to other Mercedes-Benz models and the lack of some advanced driver-assistance features as standard equipment.
