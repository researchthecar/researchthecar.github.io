Unfortunately, there is no vehicle manufactured by Mercedes-Benz called the "Torino". It is possible there's a misunderstanding of the vehicle's name. Perhaps you meant the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, E-Class, or a different model entirely? Please provide the correct model name so that I can give you accurate information.
