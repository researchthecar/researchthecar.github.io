### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Torino generally demonstrates good reliability, particularly in its suspension and exterior components. However, potential owners should be aware of specific concerns within the powertrain, notably coolant leaks and turbocharger issues in petrol engines, and DPF/AdBlue system faults in diesel variants. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, are also noted. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, can occur. While most issues are repairable with moderate to significant cost, they represent the most common deviations from expected reliability. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are advised to mitigate these potential problems.
