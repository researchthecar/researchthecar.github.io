### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Torino, while generally well-regarded, exhibits some common issues for vehicles of its age and luxury segment. Diesel engines, particularly the OM651 and OM642, can face problems with EGR valves, intake manifolds, and injectors, which are often costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission, while smooth, can develop issues with the torque converter or valve body. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and various sensors, are also noted. However, the exterior and interior generally hold up well, with only minor issues like headlight condensation or HVAC blower motor failures being prevalent. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for maintaining the reliability of this model.
