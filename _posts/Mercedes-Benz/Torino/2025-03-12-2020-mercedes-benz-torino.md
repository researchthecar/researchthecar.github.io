The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Metris Torino, a passenger van, offers a blend of practicality and Mercedes-Benz refinement. While not as luxurious as their passenger cars, it aims to provide a comfortable and capable transport solution. Common praises include its maneuverability compared to full-size vans, comfortable seating, and fuel efficiency. Criticisms often target its higher price point compared to competitors, basic interior features in lower trims, and some reported reliability concerns. The 2020 Metris Torino is equipped with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic transmission.
