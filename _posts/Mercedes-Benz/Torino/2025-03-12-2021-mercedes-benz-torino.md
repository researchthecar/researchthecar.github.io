The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Torino (This is a hypothetical vehicle as the Mercedes-Benz lineup does not include a "Torino" model. This response is created based on the prompt instructions.) aims to blend luxury and performance in a compact sedan. Let's assume it comes with two engine options: a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 producing 255 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L Turbocharged V6 generating 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise its sleek design, comfortable interior, and advanced technology features. Common dislikes often revolve around its high price point and potentially expensive maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, rough idling, and a check engine light. The high-pressure fuel pump, responsible for delivering fuel to the engine at the correct pressure, fails prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the high-pressure fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Wastegate Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, reduced boost, and a check engine light. The wastegate actuator, which controls the turbocharger's boost, may become faulty.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the wastegate actuator or the entire turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on whether actuator or full turbo replacement)

**3.0L Turbocharged V6**

*   **Oil Leaks from Valve Cover Gaskets**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Burning oil smell, visible oil leaks on the engine, and low oil levels. The valve cover gaskets may degrade, leading to oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
