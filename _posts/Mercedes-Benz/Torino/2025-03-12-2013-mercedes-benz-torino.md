Unfortunately, there is no Mercedes-Benz "Torino" model. It's possible there is a typo in your request. However, I can provide a response formatted as requested based on a real Mercedes-Benz model. Let's assume you meant the 2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W204 chassis). The 2013 C-Class was available with several engine options, including a 1.8L Turbocharged Inline-4 (C250), a 3.5L V6 (C300 and C350), and a 6.2L V8 (C63 AMG). Transmission options included a 7-speed automatic (7G-TRONIC) and, for the C63 AMG, a 7-speed MCT (Multi-Clutch Transmission). Owners often praise the C-Class for its refined interior, comfortable ride, and strong engine performance. Common dislikes include higher maintenance costs and occasionally complex electronic systems. The C250’s 1.8L turbo engine produced around 201 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque.
