The 2019 Mercedes-Benz CLS53 AMG S is a performance-oriented coupe that blends luxury with sporty driving dynamics. The sole engine option is the M256 3.0L inline-6 turbocharged engine paired with an electric auxiliary compressor and EQ Boost mild hybrid system, which produces 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. The only available transmission is the AMG Speedshift TCT 9-speed automatic. Owners often praise the CLS53 for its stylish design, powerful engine, comfortable ride, and advanced technology. Common complaints include the complicated infotainment system, limited rear headroom due to the sloping roofline, and the high price point.
