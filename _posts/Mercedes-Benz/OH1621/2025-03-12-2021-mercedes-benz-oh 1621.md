The 2021 Mercedes-Benz OH 1621 is a bus chassis, primarily used in South America and other markets outside of North America. Itâ€™s known for its robust build and adaptability to various bus body configurations. The engine option available is the OM 924 LA, a 4.8L four-cylinder diesel engine producing around 208 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. While praised for its reliability and fuel efficiency in demanding urban environments, some owners have reported issues with specific components. Because this is a chassis and not a complete vehicle, many issues can stem from the body installed on the chassis by third-party manufacturers.
