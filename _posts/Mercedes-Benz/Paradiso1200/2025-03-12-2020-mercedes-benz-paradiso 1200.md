The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Paradiso 1200 is a popular coach bus often used for long-distance travel and touring. It's typically powered by a Mercedes-Benz OM457LA engine, a 12-liter inline-six diesel, producing around 360 horsepower and considerable torque for hauling passengers and luggage. Other engine options available, though less commonly specified, may include variants within the OM400 series, offering slightly different horsepower and torque figures. Transmission options usually include Mercedes-Benz's own automated manual transmissions, like the GO 240-8. Owners often praise the Paradiso 1200 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and the reliability of the Mercedes-Benz drivetrain. Common complaints sometimes involve the complexity of the electronics, the cost of replacement parts, and accessibility for certain maintenance tasks.
