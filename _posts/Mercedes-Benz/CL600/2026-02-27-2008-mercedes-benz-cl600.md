### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CL600 is a vehicle that demands significant investment in maintenance and potential repairs due to its complex engineering and high-performance components. The V12 engine, while powerful, is prone to issues with ignition coils, turbos, and the sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, which can be particularly costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, often related to control modules like the SAM unit, are also a common concern. While the exterior and basic interior functions tend to be robust, the advanced comfort and electronic features can develop faults. Prospective buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average running costs and prioritize vehicles with a well-documented service history and recent major repairs.
