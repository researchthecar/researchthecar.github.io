### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz CL600, while a marvel of engineering, presents potential reliability concerns primarily centered around its complex V12 engine and sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system. Owners should be prepared for the possibility of costly repairs related to ignition coils, turbochargers, and ABC hydraulic components. The transmission, while generally robust, can experience issues with its control module and conductor plate. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and parking sensors, are also noted. Despite these potential drawbacks, the CL600 remains a desirable vehicle for those who prioritize performance and luxury, provided they are aware of and prepared for its maintenance demands.
