### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CL600 is a luxurious and powerful coupe, but its advanced technology and high-performance V12 engine contribute to potentially significant maintenance costs. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system is a common source of expensive repairs, with hydraulic leaks and pump failures being prevalent. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and various sensors, can also arise. While the engine and transmission are generally robust, issues with ignition coils, turbochargers, and the transmission control module can occur. Owners should budget for higher-than-average repair costs and prioritize regular, specialized maintenance to ensure long-term reliability.
