### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz CL600 is a luxurious and powerful grand tourer, but its complexity translates to potential reliability concerns. The twin-turbo V12 engine, while potent, can be costly to maintain, with ignition coils and turbochargers being common failure points. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, while providing an exceptional ride, is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which are expensive to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM unit and various sensors, are also a known issue. Transmission issues, such as TCM or conductor plate failures, can lead to significant drivability problems. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, specific electronic components within the cabin can also develop faults. Prospective buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs, and a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
