The 2004 Mercedes-Benz CL600 is a luxurious grand touring coupe powered by a potent 5.5L twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 493 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. It was also available with a 5.0L V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque and a 5.4L supercharged V8 producing 493 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque.
