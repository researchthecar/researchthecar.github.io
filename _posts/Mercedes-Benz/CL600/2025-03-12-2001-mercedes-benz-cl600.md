The 2001 Mercedes-Benz CL600 is a luxurious coupe that offered a powerful V12 engine. The CL-Class combined elegant styling with advanced technology for its time. In addition to the V12, the CL-Class was available with a V8 engine in the CL500. The CL600 produced around 362 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the car's smooth ride, powerful engine, and luxurious interior. However, the complex systems and high maintenance costs are often cited as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**5.8L V12 (M120)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly develop from the valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, and oil pan gasket. You may notice oil spots under the car or a burning smell.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light. The M120 V12 engine has two distributors and two ignition coils. These coils are prone to failure.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil (parts and labor).

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, poor performance, check engine light. Vacuum lines can become brittle and crack over time, leading to leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing damaged vacuum lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the location and extent of the damage.

**Transmission**

**722.6 5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, getting stuck in gear, or no shifting at all, limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replacing the conductor plate and potentially the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears or shifts harshly.
    *   Solution: Fluid flush and filter replacement may help in some cases. In severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) to $3000+ (rebuild or replacement).

**Suspension**

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC system is known for being problematic. Common issues include sagging suspension, warning lights, and a stiff or bouncy ride. Problems often stem from the hydraulic pump, accumulators (nitrogen-filled spheres), valve blocks, and struts.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing the faulty components. This can involve replacing the pump, accumulators, struts, or valve blocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ per component, depending on what needs to be replaced. Struts are particularly expensive. A complete ABC system overhaul can easily exceed $5000.

*   **ABC Hose Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks in the hydraulic lines of the ABC system causing fluid loss and reduced system performance
    *   Solution: Replace leaking lines

**Summary**

The 2001 Mercedes-Benz CL600 is a powerful and luxurious vehicle, but it comes with its share of potential problems. The most significant concerns are related to the complex ABC suspension system and the electrical components. Engine and transmission issues, while present, are more common with age and mileage. Repair costs can be high due to the specialized parts and labor required. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance costs when considering this model.
