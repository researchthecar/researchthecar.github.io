### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz CL600 is a complex and powerful luxury coupe. Its V12 bi-turbo engine and advanced Active Body Control suspension are highlights but also represent significant potential cost centers for repairs. Owners should anticipate potential issues with ignition coils, turbochargers, and ABC system leaks, which can be expensive to rectify. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while generally robust, can suffer from TCM or conductor plate failures. Electrical components, particularly window regulators and headlight ballasts, are also noted areas for potential concern. While the interior and exterior are generally well-built, the mechanical and electrical complexity means that proactive maintenance and a budget for unexpected repairs are essential for ownership.
