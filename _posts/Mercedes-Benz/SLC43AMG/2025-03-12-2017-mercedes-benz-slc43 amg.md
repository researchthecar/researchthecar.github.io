The 2017 Mercedes-Benz SLC43 AMG is a sporty roadster, slotting in the lineup as a performance-oriented model within the SLC (formerly SLK) range. It came equipped with a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 362 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Drivers generally praise its agile handling, responsive engine, and luxurious interior. Common complaints revolve around its somewhat firm ride, limited cargo space, and infotainment system compared to newer models. The SLC range (including non-AMG models) also came with engine options such as the 1.8L inline-4 turbo and a 2.0L inline-4 turbo depending on the trim and market, however the AMG model was exclusive to the 3.0L V6.

**Summary:** The 2017 Mercedes-Benz SLC43 AMG, while a desirable roadster, has some potential issues that owners should be aware of. Engine oil leaks from turbocharger lines and cam magnets are fairly common and can become costly if left unaddressed. Transmission issues such as rough shifting can range from minor software glitches to requiring major repairs. Electrical gremlins within the infotainment system and sensor failures can also be frustrating. Convertible top malfunctions can be costly. Overall, the severity and cost of potential repairs vary widely, but preventative maintenance and prompt attention to any developing issues can help mitigate long-term expenses.
