The 2021 Mercedes-Benz A220 is a popular entry-level luxury sedan known for its stylish design, technology features, and comfortable ride. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 188 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. It's paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praise the A220 for its fuel efficiency, user-friendly infotainment system (MBUX), and overall value. However, some common complaints include a firm ride, especially with larger wheel options, and occasional glitches with the MBUX system.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled services. There may be no visible leaks.
    *   Solution: The initial step involves monitoring oil levels closely and documenting consumption. If consumption exceeds Mercedes-Benz's acceptable threshold, a dealer may perform an oil consumption test. Depending on the results, the repair could range from replacing PCV valve components to more extensive engine work, such as piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Harsh or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly at lower speeds or when accelerating from a stop. This can manifest as a noticeable clunk or hesitation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission, including valve body and clutch pack assessment, may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (for software update) - $3000+ (for valve body replacement or clutch repair)

    *   Solution: The most common solution is a software update to the MBUX system. In more severe cases, the infotainment system module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) - $1500+ (for module replacement)
