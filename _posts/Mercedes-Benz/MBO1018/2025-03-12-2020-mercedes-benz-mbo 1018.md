The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Metris, known internally as the MBO 1018, is a versatile mid-size van often used for commercial and passenger transport. Engine options include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a 7G-TRONIC 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Metris's maneuverability, fuel efficiency (relative to larger vans), and cargo capacity.
