### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLK280 is a capable luxury coupe, but potential buyers should be aware of specific common issues. The 3.0L V6 engine can suffer from intake manifold runner flap failures and balance shaft gear wear, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission, while generally smooth, may develop valve body or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the SAM unit and CAN bus, can also arise. While suspension, exterior, and most interior components are relatively robust, these specific engine, transmission, and electrical concerns represent the most significant reliability considerations for this model year.
