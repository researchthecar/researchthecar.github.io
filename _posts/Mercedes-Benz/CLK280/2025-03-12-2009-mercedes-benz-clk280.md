**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLK280 can be a stylish and comfortable car, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the engine (balance shaft and intake manifold), transmission (torque converter and valve body), and electrical system (EIS and SAM). Repairs can be relatively costly, especially engine work, so a thorough inspection by a qualified mechanic before purchase is highly recommended. While the balance shaft issue is a well-known problem for the M272 engine, not all engines are affected. However, the potential for this failure is significant enough that it warrants careful consideration.
