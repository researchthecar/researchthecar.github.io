The 2007 Mercedes-Benz CLK280 is a stylish and comfortable coupe or cabriolet that offers a blend of luxury and performance. The CLK280 is powered by a 3.0-liter V6 engine, producing around 231 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2007 CLK range include the CLK350 with a more powerful V6, and the CLK550 with a V8. Transmission options were typically a 7-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the CLK280's elegant design, smooth ride, and well-appointed interior. Common complaints often revolve around electrical issues, maintenance costs, and the age-related wear and tear associated with a vehicle of this vintage.

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 (M272)**

*   **Balance Shaft Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noises, rough running engine, check engine light with codes related to camshaft timing, particularly P0016, P0017, P0018, P0019. This affects the earlier versions of the M272 engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the balance shaft and potentially the timing chain, sprockets, and tensioner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Failure (Tumble Flap)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor fuel economy, reduced power, and possible rough idling. Error codes P2004, P2005, P2006, P2007 are common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold assembly. Aftermarket kits are available that replace only the tumble flaps, which may be a more cost-effective repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor engine performance, rough idling, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission slipping, getting stuck in a gear, or complete loss of gear engagement. Check engine light with codes related to the transmission control unit (TCU).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the conductor plate within the transmission. Requires draining the transmission fluid and removing the valve body. Often, the pilot bushing (electrical connector) should be replaced at the same time to prevent leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, delayed engagement, or transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. Sometimes, specific solenoids within the valve body can be replaced individually.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $700 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and vague steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn control arm bushings, or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking noises, especially over bumps, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ball joint, typically requiring replacement of the control arm to which it is attached.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Key not recognized, inability to start the vehicle, steering wheel lock malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the EIS module. May require reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions of various electrical components, such as lights, wipers, or power windows.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the specific issue within the SAM, followed by repair or replacement of the module. Recoding might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery after a short period of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the parasitic draw, often caused by a faulty module or relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially around wheel wells and door bottoms)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust bubbling under the paint, particularly in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Sanding, rust treatment, and repainting the affected areas. Can range from spot repairs to full panel replacements depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (per panel)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz CLK280 can be a rewarding vehicle to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues associated with this model year. Engine problems, particularly balance shaft failure in earlier M272 engines, can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues with the 7G-Tronic are also prevalent. Electrical problems, especially with the EIS and SAM modules, can be frustrating. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, particularly if they involve major engine or transmission components. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and a detailed maintenance history are essential.
