### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz CL230 presents a mixed reliability picture. While the engines themselves are generally robust, particularly the 2.0L variant, the 2.3L supercharged engine has some specific belt and sensor concerns. Automatic transmissions, especially the 722.6, can be prone to module and conductor plate issues, which can be costly to repair. Suspension components like control arm bushings are common wear items that can lead to drivability issues if neglected. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, are also noted. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor and seat heaters can also fail. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs in the transmission, electrical, and suspension systems. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to maintaining this sporty coupe.
