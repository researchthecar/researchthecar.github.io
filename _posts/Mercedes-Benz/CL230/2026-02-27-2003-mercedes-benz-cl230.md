### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz CL230, while offering a premium experience, exhibits common issues for its age and German engineering. The 2.0L supercharged engine is generally robust but can suffer from belt wear and MAF sensor problems. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while capable, is known for potential TCM and conductor plate failures, which can be costly. Suspension components like bushings and springs are typical wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly window regulators and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior comfort features like HVAC and seat heaters can develop faults. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining reliability.
