**Summary**

The 2003 Mercedes-Benz CLK230 can be a rewarding car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine-related problems such as MAF sensor failures and oil leaks can be relatively inexpensive to fix, while supercharger problems could become costly. Transmission issues like slipping can be resolved with a fluid change or conductor plate replacement. Suspension issues such as worn ball joints and broken coil springs will arise eventually with vehicle age. Electrical issues such as instrument cluster pixel failure and faulty window regulators are also potential concerns. Addressing these problems promptly can help keep the CLK230 running smoothly. Overall, the severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more significant repairs, and the cost to fix them can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the mechanic performing the work.
