The 2021 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 is a stylish and sporty compact sedan known for its sleek design, advanced technology, and comfortable interior. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. An AMG CLA 35 variant is also available with a higher-output engine. Owners often praise the CLA250 for its luxurious feel, responsive handling, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints include a somewhat firm ride, limited rear-seat headroom, and higher-than-average maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 (M260)**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be evident through the "Check Oil Level" warning appearing on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the engine control unit (ECU) has been reported to help reduce oil consumption. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: ECU update cost varies but can range from $100 - $300. Piston ring replacement can be a much more involved and costly repair, estimated at $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the shop and extent of the work needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic (DCT)**

*   **Rough or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or jerky shifting, particularly at low speeds or during stop-and-go traffic. This can be felt as a noticeable lurch or hesitation between gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control unit (TCU) can improve shift quality. In more severe cases, clutch replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: TCU update varies from $100 - $300. Clutch replacement on a dual-clutch transmission can be expensive, estimated at $2,000 - $4,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX infotainment system can occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update is typically the first step in resolving these issues. In some cases, a hardware replacement of the infotainment unit may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates often performed free of charge at the dealership. Infotainment unit replacement can cost $1,000 - $3,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Malfunctioning Sensors**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reports of various sensors malfunctioning, including parking sensors, blind spot monitoring, and lane keep assist. This can lead to false alarms or a complete failure of the system.
    * Solution: Diagnosis with an OBDII scanner to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$800+ depending on the sensor and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or creaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear deck area. These noises can be particularly noticeable on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the rattle and applying felt tape, foam, or other sound-deadening materials to the affected area. In some cases, replacing loose or broken trim pieces may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: This can vary depending on the source of the rattle. A simple fix with felt tape may cost $50-$200. More involved repairs can cost $200-$500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 offers a blend of style and luxury, but some owners have reported issues with the engine (excessive oil consumption), transmission (rough shifting), electrical systems (infotainment glitches and sensor malfunctions), and interior (rattling noises). While some issues can be resolved with software updates, others, such as piston ring or clutch replacements, can be costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase. Overall, the severity of reported issues ranges from minor annoyances to more significant mechanical problems, with repair costs varying accordingly.
