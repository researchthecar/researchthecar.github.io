### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz CLK320 (W209) is a stylish and comfortable coupe that, with proper maintenance, can offer a rewarding ownership experience. While its core powertrain is generally robust, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as intake manifold leaks and oil seal failures on the 3.2L V6 engine. Transmission issues, particularly with the 5G-Tronic, can arise, often related to the conductor plate or TCM. Electrical gremlins, like window regulators and headlight ballasts, are also not uncommon on vehicles of this age. Interior electronics, such as pixelated displays, can also be a point of concern. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are addressable with specialized knowledge and reasonable repair costs, especially when compared to newer luxury vehicles.
