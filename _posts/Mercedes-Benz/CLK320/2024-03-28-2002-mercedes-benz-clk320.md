**Summary**

While the 2002 Mercedes-Benz CLK320 is a desirable luxury coupe, it has encountered some reliability concerns that owners should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly excessive oil consumption and timing chain failure, are among the most serious and costly to resolve. Transmission shifting problems and premature suspension wear can also affect the driving experience. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and faulty ignition switches, may not be as severe but can still be inconvenient. Additionally, owners have reported headlight fogging and seat adjustment failures that can diminish the overall quality of the interior. The severity and cost of these issues vary, and not all CLK320s will experience every problem. However, potential buyers should carefully consider these potential issues and factor them into their decision-making process.
