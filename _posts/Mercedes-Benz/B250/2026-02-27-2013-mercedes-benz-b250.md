### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz B250 offers a generally reliable ownership experience, but potential buyers should be aware of specific technical concerns. The engine, particularly the turbocharger and PCV system, can experience issues. The dual-clutch transmission, while efficient, is prone to fluid leaks and potential mechatronics unit failures. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and sensors, can occur. Exterior and interior components are typically robust, with no widespread critical failures reported. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential issues and ensuring long-term reliability.
