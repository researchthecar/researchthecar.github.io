### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mercedes-Benz B250 offers a generally solid reliability record, with the powertrain being the most common area for reported technical concerns. Issues with the turbocharger and PCV valve on the 2.0L engine, and occasional transmission shudder with the 7G-DCT, are the primary technical challenges owners may encounter. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread issues. Proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of these specific problems can help ensure a more reliable ownership experience.
