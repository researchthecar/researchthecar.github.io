**Summary**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG is a high-performance luxury vehicle that demands significant maintenance. While the engine provides exhilarating power, it is susceptible to oil leaks and turbocharger issues, potentially leading to costly repairs. The AIRMATIC suspension is also prone to failures. Electronic issues, particularly with the COMAND system and battery drain, are also common. These issues combined can lead to very expensive repair bills, often exceeding $5,000. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified Mercedes-Benz mechanic and budget for the high cost of ownership associated with this model.
