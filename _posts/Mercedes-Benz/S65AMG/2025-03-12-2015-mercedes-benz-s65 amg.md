**Engine**

**6.0L Twin-Turbo V12**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various areas of the engine, including valve cover gaskets, oil cooler lines, and the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil puddles under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the typical solution. Diagnosis may involve pressure testing the oil system to pinpoint the exact source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the location and complexity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the V12 layout, this engine has twelve individual ignition coils. These can fail over time, leading to misfires, rough running, and a check engine light. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) will usually indicate which cylinder is misfiring.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil is required. It is often recommended to replace all coils at once to ensure consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per coil (parts and labor).
