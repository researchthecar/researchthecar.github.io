The 2019 Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG is a pinnacle of luxury and performance, boasting a handcrafted 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. This powerhouse is paired with an AMG Speedshift 7G-Tronic automatic transmission. Owners often praise the car for its opulent interior, smooth ride (despite the performance focus), and the sheer power and effortless acceleration. However, some common complaints include the high running costs, complex electronics that can be prone to glitches, and the overall cost of maintenance and repairs. Other engine options include a 4.0L Biturbo V8 Engine, and a 3.0L Turbocharged Inline-6 engine.

**Summary**
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG offers exhilarating performance and luxurious features, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger problems can be costly to repair, as can issues with the AIRMATIC suspension. Electrical gremlins and infotainment glitches can also be frustrating. While not every S65 AMG will experience all of these issues, it's essential to have any potential purchase thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic to identify and address any existing or potential problems. The costs of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousands, so budgeting for potential maintenance is crucial.
