### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG is a highly complex vehicle with a powerful V12 engine and advanced systems. While it offers exceptional luxury and performance, potential owners should be aware of specific areas that may require attention. The engine, particularly its turbocharging and ignition systems, can experience issues like coil failures or wastegate problems. The sophisticated Active Body Control suspension is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment and battery management systems, are also noted concerns. Transmission issues, though less common, can involve the control module or torque converter. Despite these potential issues, the S65 AMG is generally considered reliable for its class, provided regular, specialized maintenance is performed.
