### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG, while a marvel of engineering, presents potential reliability concerns primarily within its complex V12 engine, sophisticated transmission, and advanced Active Body Control suspension system. Owners may encounter issues such as ignition coil failures, oil cooler leaks, and turbocharger problems, alongside transmission control module or torque converter faults. The ABC system is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Interior components like HVAC blower motors and seat adjustment mechanisms can also require attention. Despite these potential issues, the S65 AMG remains a highly desirable vehicle, but prospective buyers should be aware of the potential for significant repair costs associated with its high-performance and luxury features.
