The 2007 Mercedes-Benz S500 is a luxury sedan known for its opulent features, smooth ride, and powerful engine. This model year offered a blend of comfort and performance that appealed to a wide range of buyers. The S500 was primarily equipped with a 5.5L V8 engine producing around 382 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. The S500 could also be paired with the 4MATIC all-wheel drive system. Owners often praised its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and advanced technology for its time. Common complaints include the high cost of maintenance, complex electronics prone to failure, and expensive repairs. The S-Class aims to deliver an exceptional driving experience, but its complexity can lead to significant ownership costs.

**Engine**

**5.5L V8**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks commonly develop from the valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks on the engine, oil drips on the ground, and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected gaskets or seals is necessary. In some cases, the entire oil filter housing may need replacement if it is warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the location and complexity of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:
Air compressor malfunction causes the car to become unstable because there is no air available to inflate the system. The car will sag after the compressor fails.
    *   Solution:
Replacing the affected air compressor is necessary. In some cases, the relay may also need to be replaced if it is damaged or corroded.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Magnet Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Camshaft adjuster magnet failure causes the engine to malfunction. The car will become unstable after the magnet fails.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected camshaft adjuster magnet is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (depending on the complexity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC 7-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 7G-TRONIC transmission can experience valve body problems, leading to harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or a complete loss of gear engagement.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body is the typical solution. In some cases, flushing the transmission and replacing the fluid and filter can temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but the underlying problem often returns.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause shuddering at low speeds, vibrations, and difficulty accelerating. In severe cases, it can lead to complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter is necessary. It's often recommended to flush the transmission and replace the fluid and filter during this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Airmatic suspension system is prone to leaks in the air struts, leading to a sagging vehicle, uneven ride height, and a rough ride. The air compressor can also fail due to overwork from compensating for leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air struts and/or the air compressor is necessary. It's often recommended to replace struts in pairs to ensure even suspension performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ (depending on the number of components replaced and the brand of parts used)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various ECUs in the S500, such as the engine control module (ECM) or transmission control module (TCM), can fail or develop communication problems. Symptoms include warning lights on the dashboard, erratic engine performance, transmission problems, and various electrical malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific ECU that is failing and replacing or reprogramming it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the ECU and the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can occur due to a parasitic draw from a faulty module or electrical component. This can lead to a dead battery, especially if the vehicle sits for an extended period.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw. This can involve testing various circuits and components to isolate the faulty module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the difficulty of diagnosing the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can fail, causing the sunroof to get stuck, make excessive noise, or leak.

**Summary**
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz S500, while luxurious and powerful, can present owners with several potential issues. Engine oil leaks, transmission valve body and torque converter failures, and Airmatic suspension problems are among the most significant. Electrical issues, particularly with the ECU and battery drain, can also be problematic. Interior components like the COMAND system and door lock actuators are also known to fail. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the high cost of maintenance when considering this vehicle.
