The 2023 Mercedes-Benz S500 is a luxury sedan known for its opulent interior, advanced technology, and smooth ride. The S500 features a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine paired with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, producing 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the S580 featuring a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 496 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, and the S580e plug-in hybrid, combining the inline-six with an electric motor. All engines are paired with a 9G-Tronic nine-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the S500's comfortable and quiet cabin, cutting-edge driver-assistance features, and overall sense of refinement. Common complaints include the complexity of the infotainment system, the high price tag, and occasional software glitches.

**Electrical**

*   **MBUX Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) infotainment system occasionally freezes, crashes, or reboots unexpectedly. This can disrupt navigation, media playback, and access to vehicle settings.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Mercedes-Benz are often released to address these issues. A system reset (performed by holding the power button) can sometimes temporarily resolve the problem. In more severe cases, a dealer visit for a software re-flash or hardware replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free. Hardware replacements can range from $500 - $2000+, depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Driver Assistance Systems Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues reported with the adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and blind spot monitoring systems. Symptoms include systems deactivating unexpectedly, providing incorrect alerts, or failing to function at all.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of the sensors or replacement of faulty sensors. Software updates are also frequently part of the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the sensor or module that needs replacement and labor costs for calibration.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with the 12V battery draining quickly, particularly when the vehicle is not driven for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the car or a complete failure to start.
    *   Solution: Software updates can help to optimize the vehicle's energy management system. A parasitic drain test can identify the source of the drain. Replacing a faulty battery or module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement $200-$500. Parasitic drain diagnosis $100-$300. Module replacement $300-$1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Rattling or Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the sunroof or moonroof area, particularly when driving on uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the sunroof tracks and seals, tightening loose components, or replacing worn seals. In severe cases, replacement of the sunroof assembly may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Lubrication and minor adjustments $50-$200. Sunroof assembly replacement $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Adjustment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Electric seat adjustments malfunctioning or failing to operate smoothly. This can include issues with the seat moving in the wrong direction, becoming stuck, or failing to respond to the controls.
    *   Solution: Checking the seat control module, wiring harness, and seat motors. Replacing faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The S500 features an air suspension system. Owners have reported occasional air leaks, leading to a drop in ride height on one or more corners of the vehicle. This can result in a rougher ride and potentially damage other suspension components.
    *   Solution: Locating and repairing the air leak. This may involve replacing air struts, air lines, or the air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air strut replacement $800-$2000+ per strut. Air compressor replacement $500-$1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension compressor fails to provide sufficient air pressure, resulting in the vehicle sitting low or failing to adjust to different ride heights.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six (M256)**
