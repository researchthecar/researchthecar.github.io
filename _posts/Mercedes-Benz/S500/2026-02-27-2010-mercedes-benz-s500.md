### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz S500 is a luxurious and technologically advanced vehicle, but its complexity can lead to specific reliability concerns as it ages. The most notable potential issues lie within the engine's timing system and oil seals, the 7-speed automatic transmission's valve body and torque converter, and particularly the sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, which can be prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM modules or infotainment system, can also arise. While routine maintenance is crucial for any vehicle, owners of the 2010 S500 should be particularly aware of these potential high-cost repair areas. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs, the S500 can remain a comfortable and reliable luxury sedan.
