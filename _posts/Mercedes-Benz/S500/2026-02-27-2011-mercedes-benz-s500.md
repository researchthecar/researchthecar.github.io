### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz S500 is a sophisticated luxury vehicle that, while offering a high level of comfort and performance, can present some notable reliability challenges as it ages. The most common areas of concern revolve around its complex Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, which can be prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, leading to significant repair costs. The 7-speed automatic transmission, particularly its control module and valve body, can also require attention. Electrically, issues with the SAM module and Keyless Go system are documented. Engine-wise, ignition coils and oil cooler leaks are the primary reported concerns. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, infotainment glitches can occur. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential costs, especially regarding the suspension and transmission, and factor in the possibility of higher maintenance expenses compared to less complex vehicles.
