### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz S500 offers a luxurious experience but comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly in its advanced systems. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is prone to leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrically, issues with the instrument cluster, SAM modules, and keyless entry systems are not uncommon. The 5.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but ignition coils and oil cooler seals can be points of failure. Transmission issues, especially with the conductor plate, require attention. While the interior offers comfort, seat controls and headliner sagging can occur. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair costs associated with these complex luxury features.
