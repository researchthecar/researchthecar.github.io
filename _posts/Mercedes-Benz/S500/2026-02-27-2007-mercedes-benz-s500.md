### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz S500 offers a luxurious driving experience but comes with potential reliability concerns, particularly in its advanced systems. The engine's timing chain and potential oil leaks require attention. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can experience issues with its control module and torque converter. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM modules and Keyless Go system, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, specific comfort features like seat controls and sunroofs can develop faults. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially high maintenance and repair costs associated with these complex luxury components.
