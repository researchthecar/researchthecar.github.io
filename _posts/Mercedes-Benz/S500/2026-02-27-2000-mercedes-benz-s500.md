### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mercedes-Benz S500 offers a luxurious driving experience but comes with a notable potential for repair costs, primarily due to its complex electronic and hydraulic systems. The Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is a common source of expensive repairs, and electrical gremlins related to the Body Control Module and CAN bus are not uncommon. Engine and transmission issues, while less frequent than some other components, can also be costly to address. Regular and diligent maintenance, especially fluid changes for the transmission and ABC system, is crucial. Prospective buyers should factor in potential repair expenses, particularly for the ABC system and electronics, when considering this vehicle.
