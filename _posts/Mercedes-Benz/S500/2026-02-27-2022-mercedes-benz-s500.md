### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Mercedes-Benz S500 demonstrates a strong reliability profile, particularly in its core powertrain components. The 3.0L inline-six engine and 9G-TRONIC transmission are robust and generally free from significant issues. Potential concerns tend to arise in the more complex systems, such as the AIRMATIC air suspension, where leaks or compressor failures can occur, and the advanced MBUX infotainment system, which may experience occasional software glitches. Electrical systems, specifically the 12V auxiliary battery, can also be a point of attention. While interior and exterior components are largely reliable, isolated issues with seat actuators have been noted. Overall, the S500 offers a dependable luxury experience, with most reported issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic powertrain weaknesses.
