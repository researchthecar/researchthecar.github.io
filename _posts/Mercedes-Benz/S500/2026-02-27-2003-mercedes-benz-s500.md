### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz S500 offers a luxurious and powerful driving experience, but potential owners should be aware of its specific reliability challenges. The most common and potentially costly issues tend to be related to the advanced Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, particularly hydraulic leaks and pump failures. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from water intrusion into the SAM units or failures in the Electronic Ignition Switch (EIS), are also frequently reported and can lead to a wide range of symptoms. Engine components like ignition coils and oil cooler seals, along with transmission control modules and conductor plates, can require attention. While the interior and exterior have fewer widespread critical failures, issues like sagging headliners and malfunctioning door actuators can occur. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these known problem areas are essential for mitigating repair costs and ensuring the long-term reliability of this sophisticated luxury sedan.
