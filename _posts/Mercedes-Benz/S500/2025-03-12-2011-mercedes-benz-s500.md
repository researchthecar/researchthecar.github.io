The 2011 Mercedes-Benz S500 is a luxury sedan known for its comfort, advanced technology, and powerful performance. The S500 model specifically features a 4.7L V8 engine producing 429 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available in the 2011 S-Class lineup include a 3.0L V6 in the S350, a 5.5L V8 in the S550 (not available in all markets), a 6.0L V12 in the S600, and AMG variants with even more powerful engines. All engines are paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the S500 for its smooth ride, opulent interior, and advanced safety features. Some common complaints revolve around the high maintenance costs associated with luxury vehicles and the complexity of the electronic systems.

**Engine**

**4.7L V8 (M278)**

* **Oil Leaks From Camshaft Adjuster Solenoids**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the camshaft adjuster solenoid seals. Noticeable oil smell or visible oil accumulation on the engine.
    * Solution: Replace the camshaft adjuster solenoid seals or the complete solenoid if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **High Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, long cranking times, rough idle, stalling, or loss of power. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel pressure or fuel pump performance may be present.
    * Solution: Replace the high-pressure fuel pump.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Automatic (7G-TRONIC)**

* **Torque Converter Failure/Shuddering**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Can worsen over time.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.  Flushing the transmission may provide temporary relief but is usually not a permanent fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues (Specifically Solenoid Malfunctions)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, getting stuck in a gear, or complete loss of transmission function.
    * Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.  In some cases, individual solenoids can be replaced if the valve body itself is not damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ (depending on whether the whole valve body needs to be replaced)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Airmatic Suspension Compressor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car sits low, particularly on one side.  The Airmatic system warning light is illuminated.  The compressor may run constantly or not at all.
    * Solution: Replace the Airmatic suspension compressor. Check for leaks in the air struts that may have caused the compressor to overwork and fail.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Airmatic Strut Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The car sags overnight or after being parked for a period.  Hissing sound from the strut. Airmatic system warning light.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking Airmatic strut.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+ per strut
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **COMAND System Issues (Screen Freezing, No Audio)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The central COMAND screen freezes, becomes unresponsive, or displays error messages. No audio from the speakers.
    * Solution: The head unit itself can fail. Diagnose the specific component that is failing.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the component that has failed.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period, especially if the car is not driven frequently.
    * Solution: Perform a parasitic drain test to identify the circuit or component causing the drain. Common culprits include the COMAND system, seat control modules, or door control modules not shutting down properly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the source of the drain
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Parking Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Parking sensors failing to detect objects, or false positives (beeping when nothing is there).
    * Solution: Inspect and replace any faulty sensors, or repair the wiring to the sensors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the number of faulty sensors
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Mechanism Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroof jams, makes grinding noises, or fails to open or close completely.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the sunroof mechanism (tracks, motor, etc.).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz S500, while luxurious and powerful, can be prone to several issues that owners should be aware of. Engine oil leaks and high-pressure fuel pump failures are potential concerns in the engine department. The 7-speed transmission may exhibit torque converter or valve body problems, leading to costly repairs. The Airmatic suspension is also a common area of concern, with compressor and strut failures being frequently reported. Electrical glitches, particularly within the COMAND system and battery drain issues, can also be problematic. While some interior issues such as sunroof failures can occur, most of the major problems are associated with mechanical and electrical components, leading to potentially high repair costs. Potential buyers should consider a pre-purchase inspection and be prepared for the higher maintenance expenses typically associated with high-end luxury vehicles.
