### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz S500 offers a luxurious experience but requires diligent maintenance and awareness of its potential weak points. The most significant concerns revolve around the complex Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, which can be costly to repair if leaks or pump failures occur. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the SAM modules and window regulators, are also common. The 5.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but ignition system components and oil cooler seals can require attention. Transmission issues, especially with the conductor plate and TCM, are not uncommon. While the interior and exterior are generally well-built, specific electrical components within the climate control can fail. Prospective buyers should factor in potential repair costs for these known issues.
