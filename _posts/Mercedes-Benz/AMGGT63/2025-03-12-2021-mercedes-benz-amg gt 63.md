**Summary**

The most severe and costly problems tend to be related to the engine (turbocharger failure, oil leaks), transmission (slipping, rough shifting) and suspension (air suspension malfunctions). Electrical gremlins in the infotainment system and issues with exterior features like the panoramic sunroof also surface. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive (software updates), major repairs can run into the thousands of dollars. Due to the complexity and high cost of parts, owners should be diligent with maintenance and address any issues promptly to avoid further damage.
