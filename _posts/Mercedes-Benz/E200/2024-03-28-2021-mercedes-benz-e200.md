## 2021 Mercedes-Benz E200

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz E200 is a premium mid-size sedan that offers a luxurious driving experience. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 turbocharged engine that produces 197 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Higher trim levels offer a 3.0-liter inline-6 turbocharged engine with 362 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission.

While the E200 is generally praised for its refined interior, advanced technology, and smooth ride, there have been some reported issues with certain components.

**Engine**

* **2.0L Inline-4 Turbocharged**
    * **Intake Valve Deposits:** Carbon buildup on the intake valves can lead to reduced engine power and fuel efficiency. **Cleaning the intake valves** is required to resolve the issue. **$500 - $1,000+**
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** Premature failures of the turbocharger have been reported in some cases. **Replacing the turbocharger** assembly is necessary. **$2,500 - $3,500+**

* **3.0L Inline-6 Turbocharged**
    * **Fuel Injector Failure:** Malfunctioning fuel injectors can cause engine misfires, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. **Replacing the fuel injectors** is required. **$1,000 - $2,000+**
    * **Coolant Leak from Water Pump:** A leaking water pump can lead to overheating and engine damage. **Replacing the water pump** and associated gaskets is required. **$1,500 - $2,500+**

**Transmission**

* **9-Speed Automatic**
    * **Shifting Hesitation:** Occasional hesitation or delayed shifting has been reported, particularly during gear changes under acceleration. **Software updates** may be available to address the issue. **Varies**
    * **Transmission Fluid Leak:** Leaks from the transmission pan or seals can lead to fluid loss and transmission damage. **Replacing the leaking parts** is required. **$500 - $1,500+**

**Suspension**

* **Airmatic Suspension Malfunction:** Issues with the air struts or compressor can cause the suspension to fail, resulting in a rough ride or uneven vehicle height. **Replacing the faulty components** is required. **$2,000 - $5,000+**

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge with Keyless Entry:** Leaving the keyless entry fob near the vehicle can sometimes drain the battery prematurely. **Ensuring the key fob is kept away from the vehicle** when not in use can prevent the issue. **N/A**
