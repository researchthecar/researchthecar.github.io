The 2018 Mercedes-Benz E200 is a popular luxury sedan, praised for its refined ride, luxurious interior, and advanced technology features. However, some owners have reported certain issues. The E200 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine, producing 184 horsepower and 300 Nm of torque. Other engine options available in the 2018 E-Class range include a more powerful 2.0-liter turbo engine in the E300, a 3.0-liter V6 in the E400, and a 4.0-liter V8 in the AMG models. All engines are typically paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. What people typically like about the E200 is its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and sophisticated styling. What they sometimes dislike is the complexity of the infotainment system and potential for electrical glitches.
