The 2017 Mercedes-Benz E200 is part of the W213 E-Class generation, a popular luxury sedan known for its comfort, technology, and elegant design. While the E200 features a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing approximately 184 horsepower and 300 Nm of torque, other engine options available for the 2017 E-Class range include more powerful gasoline and diesel variants. Transmission options typically include a 9-speed automatic (9G-TRONIC). Owners often praise the E200 for its refined interior, smooth ride, and advanced driver-assistance systems. However, some common complaints revolve around electronic glitches, premature wear of certain components, and the cost of maintenance.
