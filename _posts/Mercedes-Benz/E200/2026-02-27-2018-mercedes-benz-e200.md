### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mercedes-Benz E200 demonstrates a strong overall reliability record, consistent with the brand's reputation for building durable luxury vehicles. The primary areas that may require attention beyond standard maintenance include potential oil leaks from the engine, occasional issues with the turbocharger, and fluid leaks or software glitches within the 9G-TRONIC transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. For models equipped with air suspension, leaks can be a concern. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not widespread enough to overshadow the E200's general dependability. Proactive maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are recommended for optimal long-term ownership.
