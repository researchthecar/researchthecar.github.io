### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz S450 is a luxurious vehicle with a generally solid foundation, but its complexity means certain components require attention. The engine, particularly the 4.7L V8, can experience timing chain and intake manifold issues. The 7-speed automatic transmission, while smooth, is prone to TCM and torque converter problems. The advanced Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, a hallmark of the S-Class, is a significant source of potential repair costs due to hydraulic leaks and pump failures. Electrical gremlins, especially within the COMAND infotainment system and keyless entry, are also noted. Interior components like seat functions and headliners can also develop issues over time. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential costs and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections, especially focusing on the suspension and powertrain.
