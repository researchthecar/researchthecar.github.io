### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz S450 is a luxurious vehicle with a generally solid foundation, but potential owners should be aware of specific common issues. The engine, particularly the 4.7L V8, can experience timing chain wear and oil leaks, requiring significant repair costs. The 7G-TRONIC transmission may develop shifting problems. The advanced Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, while providing an exceptional ride, is prone to hydraulic leaks and component failures, which can be very expensive to fix. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment and keyless entry systems, are also noted. Interior components like seat controls and the sunroof can also require attention. Despite these potential issues, many S450s are well-maintained and can offer a rewarding ownership experience if these common problems are addressed proactively or budgeted for.
