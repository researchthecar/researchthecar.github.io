### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mercedes-Benz S450 generally demonstrates good reliability, particularly in its powertrain. The 3.0L twin-turbo V6 engine and 9-speed automatic transmission are robust. However, potential owners should be aware of possible issues with the AIRMATIC air suspension system, which can be costly to repair if leaks or compressor failures occur. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the COMAND infotainment system's software and occasional parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Interior components like power seat motors can occasionally require attention. Overall, while not immune to problems, the S450's reliability is largely in line with expectations for a high-end luxury vehicle, with most reported issues being manageable with proper diagnosis and repair.
