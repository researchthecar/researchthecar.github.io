The 2016 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG S is a performance sedan lauded for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and sporty handling. It's powered by a hand-built 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 503 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT transmission. Owners often praise the car's exhilarating acceleration, aggressive exhaust note, and comfortable yet supportive seats.
