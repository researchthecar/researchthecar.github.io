### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE500 is a capable luxury SUV with a generally good reliability record. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to revolve around the optional AIRMATIC air suspension system, with potential for leaks and compressor failures. The powertrain, particularly the 4.7L twin-turbo V8 and 7-speed automatic transmission, can experience issues like turbocharger problems and transmission shudder, though these are not universal. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also noted. Owners opting for the standard suspension will likely avoid the complexities and potential costs associated with the AIRMATIC system. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the GLE500's long-term reliability and performance.
