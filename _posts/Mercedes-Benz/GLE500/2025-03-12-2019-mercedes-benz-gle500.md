The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE500 is a mid-size luxury SUV that offers a blend of comfort, performance, and technology. The GLE500 is powered by a 4.7L Twin Turbo V8 Engine that produces 402 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque and is mated to a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available for the 2019 GLE include a 3.0L Turbo V6, a 3.5L V6, and a 2.0L Turbo Inline-4. There's also the AMG GLE 43 and AMG GLE 63 variants that offer higher performance. Owners generally appreciate the GLE's luxurious interior, smooth ride, and powerful engine options. Common dislikes include the somewhat dated infotainment system (before the MBUX update), higher running costs, and occasional electronic glitches.

**Summary:**

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE500, while a luxurious and capable SUV, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the air suspension, electrical systems (infotainment and battery drain), and transmission. The engine itself seems relatively reliable, but turbo oil leaks are a possibility. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor software updates or component replacements to several thousand dollars for major suspension or transmission work. It's recommended to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic familiar with Mercedes-Benz vehicles to identify any potential problems before buying.
