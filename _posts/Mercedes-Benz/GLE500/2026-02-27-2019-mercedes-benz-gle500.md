### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLE500 generally presents a reliable ownership experience, particularly concerning its core powertrain. The 4.7L V8 engine is robust, though potential issues with turbochargers and oil leaks should be monitored. The 7-speed automatic transmission is smooth but can occasionally exhibit shuddering, often rectifiable with maintenance. The AIRMATIC air suspension is a common area for concern, with leaks in air springs or compressor failures being the most reported issues, leading to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Exterior lighting and interior climate control components can also require attention. Overall, while not immune to problems, the GLE500's issues are largely concentrated in specific, albeit sometimes costly, systems.
