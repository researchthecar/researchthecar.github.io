The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Maybach S600 represents the pinnacle of luxury and refinement within the Mercedes-Benz lineup. Powered by a robust 6.0L Twin-Turbo V12 engine producing 523 horsepower and 612 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7G-TRONIC 7-speed automatic transmission, the S600 delivers effortless performance and a supremely comfortable ride.
