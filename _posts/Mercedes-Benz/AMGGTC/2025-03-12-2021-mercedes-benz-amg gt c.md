The 2021 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT C is a high-performance sports car known for its stunning looks, powerful engine, and impressive handling. The AMG GT C specifically features a handcrafted 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 550 horsepower and 502 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Other engine options in the AMG GT lineup include the standard AMG GT with a lower-output version of the same V8, and the more potent AMG GT R with an even higher output version. Owners often praise the AMG GT C for its exhilarating performance, luxurious interior, and distinctive exhaust note. Common complaints often revolve around the firm ride, limited practicality due to its two-seater configuration, and relatively high running costs.
