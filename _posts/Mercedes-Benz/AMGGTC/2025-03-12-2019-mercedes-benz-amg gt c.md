**Summary**

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT C, while a stunning and powerful sports car, is not without its potential issues. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger problems can be costly to address. The dual-clutch transmission may exhibit rough shifting or hesitation and, in some cases, require extensive repairs. Electrical issues with the infotainment system and sensor failures can also occur.
