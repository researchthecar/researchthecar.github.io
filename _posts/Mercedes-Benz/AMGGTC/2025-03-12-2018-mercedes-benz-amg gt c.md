The 2018 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT C is a high-performance sports car known for its stunning design, exhilarating performance, and luxurious interior. The AMG GT C is powered by a handcrafted 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that produces 550 horsepower and 502 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available in the 2018 AMG GT range include a lower-output version of the same 4.0L twin-turbo V8 in the base AMG GT (469 hp), and a higher-output version in the AMG GT R (577 hp). All models utilize a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praise the AMG GT C for its impressive power, responsive handling, and striking aesthetics. Some common criticisms include the firm ride, limited cargo space, and high price point.

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various points on the engine, including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and turbocharger lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty gaskets or seals. Tightening loose connections on turbocharger lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+, depending on the location and complexity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the turbochargers can occur. Symptoms include decreased engine power, unusual noises (whining or whistling) from the engine bay, and possibly error codes.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for turbocharger replacement (parts and labor), varying depending on if one or both need replacing.

    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control unit (TCU) may resolve some shifting issues. In more severe cases, replacement of solenoids or other internal components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 for software updates; $1,000 - $4,000+ for component replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping can occur, particularly under heavy acceleration or high load conditions. Symptoms include the engine revving without a corresponding increase in speed, or a "slipping" sensation during gear changes.
    *   Solution: This may require a rebuild or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
