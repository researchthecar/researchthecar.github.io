### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz E43 AMG (W213) generally presents a strong reliability record for its performance class. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to its advanced technology and performance-oriented systems. Issues with the turbocharger wastegate actuators, potential coolant leaks from the thermostat housing, and occasional transmission software glitches are the most frequently cited engine and transmission problems. The optional AIR BODY CONTROL suspension can be prone to air spring leaks, a common issue with air suspension systems. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and battery drain, can also occur. Exterior and interior components, while not immune, show fewer widespread issues. Overall, the E43 AMG is a reliable performance sedan, but owners should be prepared for potential costs associated with its sophisticated features and AMG-specific components.
