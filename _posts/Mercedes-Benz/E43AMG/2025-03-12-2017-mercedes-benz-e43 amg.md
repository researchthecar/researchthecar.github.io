The 2017 Mercedes-Benz E43 AMG is a performance-oriented sedan that slots between the standard E-Class and the more powerful E63 AMG. It's equipped with a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 396 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-Tronic 9-speed automatic transmission and 4MATIC all-wheel drive. While praised for its brisk acceleration, agile handling, luxurious interior, and advanced technology, some owners have reported specific issues. Dislikes often center around the firm ride quality, particularly with the optional performance tires, and the high cost of maintenance and repairs. Other available engines in the 2017 E-Class lineup include a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 and a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6.
