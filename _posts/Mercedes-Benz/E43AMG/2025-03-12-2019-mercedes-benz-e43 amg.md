The 2019 Mercedes-Benz E43 AMG is a performance-oriented sedan that bridges the gap between the standard E-Class and the more aggressive E63 AMG. It features a handcrafted 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 engine producing 396 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission and 4MATIC all-wheel drive. Some owners love the car's blend of luxury and performance, praising its comfortable ride, responsive engine, and stylish interior. On the other hand, some owners dislike the complexity of the infotainment system and the high cost of maintenance and repairs. While the E-Class also comes with other engine options, including a 2.0L Turbo 4-cylinder, and a 3.0L inline-6 turbo with mild hybrid drive, we will be focusing on the E43 AMGâ€™s specific engine.
