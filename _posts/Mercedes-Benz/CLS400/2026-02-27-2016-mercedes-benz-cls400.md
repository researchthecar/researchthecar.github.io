### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLS400 generally demonstrates good reliability, consistent with its luxury segment positioning. The primary areas where owners might encounter issues are related to the twin-turbo V6 engine's turbocharger components and potential oil leaks from valve cover gaskets. The automatic transmission can occasionally experience issues with its control module or torque converter. For models equipped with air suspension, leaks are a known concern. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also reported. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not typically indicative of systemic failures across the entire model range. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining the CLS400's long-term dependability.
