### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLS400 demonstrates a commendable level of reliability for a luxury performance sedan. The powertrain, particularly the 3.0L twin-turbo V6 and 7-speed automatic transmission, is robust, though occasional issues with turbocharger actuators and transmission control modules can arise. The AirMatic suspension system, while offering superior comfort, is a notable area where owners might encounter costly repairs like air strut leaks or compressor failures; opting for the standard coil spring suspension mitigates this risk.
