The 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQS 580 4MATIC is a luxury electric sedan lauded for its opulent interior, cutting-edge technology, and impressive performance. The EQS 580 boasts a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system producing 536 horsepower and 633 lb-ft of torque. A less powerful EQS 450+ is also available, featuring a single rear-mounted motor. While owners generally appreciate the EQS 580's comfort, technology, and rapid acceleration, some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the infotainment system, software glitches, and the high price point.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Motor (EQS 580)**
*   **Loss of Power/Reduced Range**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a sudden loss of power or a significant reduction in the vehicle's stated range. This may be accompanied by error messages or warnings on the instrument cluster. It can be intermittent or persistent.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a Mercedes-Benz certified technician is needed to determine the root cause. This may involve checking the battery management system, individual battery modules, motor control units, and wiring harnesses. Software updates are often applied to address potential software-related issues impacting range or performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis costs can range from $200-$500 depending on labor. Repairs can range from software updates (typically covered under warranty) to battery module replacement, which could cost thousands of dollars if not under warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

**Battery Pack**
*   **Premature Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A few owners have reported experiencing faster-than-expected battery degradation, leading to reduced range over time. This is usually noticeable within the first few years of ownership.
    *   Solution: A battery capacity test by a Mercedes-Benz technician is required to assess the level of degradation. If the degradation exceeds the manufacturer's warranty limits, the battery pack or individual modules may be replaced under warranty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery capacity tests can range from $200 - $500. Battery replacements can range from $10,000 - $30,000, and would likely be covered by the battery warranty.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MBUX Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX infotainment system can experience various glitches, including freezing, lagging, screen blackouts, and unexpected reboots. Voice command recognition may also be inconsistent.
    *   Solution: Restarting the system may temporarily resolve the issue. Software updates from Mercedes-Benz often address these glitches. In some cases, a complete system reset or replacement of the MBUX control unit might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software updates are typically free or covered under warranty. System resets are a similar cost to software updates. Replacement of the MBUX control unit can cost $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions in the various sensors (parking sensors, lane keeping assist sensors, blind spot monitoring sensors) can occur. These malfunctions can lead to false alerts, system inoperability, or error messages.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with Mercedes-Benz diagnostic tools is needed to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor is typically required. Calibration of the system after sensor replacement is also necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per sensor, depending on the location and complexity of the replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Door Handle Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic door handles may sometimes fail to extend or retract properly. This can be due to a faulty actuator, sensor, or mechanical obstruction.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the cause of the door handle malfunction is required. This may involve checking the door handle mechanism, wiring harness, and control module. Replacement of the faulty component is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the part that needs to be replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power seat motors may sometimes fail, preventing adjustment of the seat position. This can affect one or more seat functions (e.g., forward/backward, up/down, lumbar support).
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with Mercedes-Benz diagnostic tools is needed to identify the faulty motor. Replacement of the motor is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ per seat motor, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system, designed for a smooth ride, can experience problems like sagging on one side, complete deflation, or failure to adjust ride height. These issues can stem from leaks in the air struts, a faulty compressor, or a malfunctioning control module.
    *   Solution: A thorough inspection of the air suspension system by a qualified technician is necessary. This includes checking for leaks, testing the compressor, and diagnosing the control module. Depending on the findings, repairs may involve replacing individual air struts, the compressor, or the control module. Recalibration of the system may also be needed after repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Replacing an air strut can cost $1,000 - $2,000+. A new compressor can range from $800 - $1,500+. Control module replacement can vary from $500 - $1,500+, depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQS 580, while celebrated for its luxury and technology, is not without its potential issues. Electrical glitches, particularly with the MBUX system, and air suspension problems are among the more common complaints. While some issues may be minor software annoyances, others, like battery degradation or suspension failures, can be costly to repair. The severity of these issues varies, but potential buyers should be aware of them and ensure thorough inspections and warranty coverage when considering this vehicle.
