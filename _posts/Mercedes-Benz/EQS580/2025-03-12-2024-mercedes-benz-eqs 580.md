The 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQS 580 4MATIC is a luxury electric sedan that boasts impressive performance and technology. The EQS 580 is powered by a dual-motor setup that delivers all-wheel drive and generates 536 horsepower and 633 lb-ft of torque. Other EQS models include the EQS 450+ and the AMG EQS. Owners often praise the EQS 580 for its opulent interior, smooth ride, and cutting-edge features like the MBUX Hyperscreen. However, some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the infotainment system, the regenerative braking feel, and the high price tag.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual Motor (536 hp, 633 lb-ft)**

*   **Reduced Power Output/Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances where the vehicle suddenly enters "turtle mode," severely limiting power output. This can occur even with a substantial charge remaining and without any warning messages initially. The cause is a sensor issue and the error message "Reduced power output. Visit workshop" will display.
    *   Solution: The dealer will need to identify the faulty sensor and replace it. Common sensors include the wheel speed sensors, temperature sensors in the battery pack, and sensors related to the electric motor cooling system. A software update may be applied in conjunction with the sensor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the sensor and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MBUX Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX system, which controls virtually all vehicle functions, can freeze, become unresponsive, or crash entirely. This can affect navigation, climate control, audio, and even safety features.
    *   Solution: A software update from Mercedes-Benz is typically required. In some cases, a hard reset of the system may be necessary, performed by a dealer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Usually covered under warranty; otherwise, diagnostic and software update labor can range from $150-$500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EQS, like other EVs, relies on a 12V battery to power auxiliary systems. Premature battery drain can lead to starting issues or failure of electronics. This is often attributed to software glitches keeping systems active when the vehicle is off.
    *   Solution: Dealer inspection to identify parasitic drain. Software updates and/or replacement of the 12V battery are typical fixes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery replacement $300 - $500; diagnostic and software updates $150 - $500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report issues with AC charging, including the vehicle failing to recognize the charging station or slow charging speeds. DC fast charging problems are less common but can occur.
    *   Solution: Verifying the charging station is functioning correctly is the first step. If the issue persists, a dealer inspection of the vehicle's charging port, onboard charger, and related software is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnostic fees $150 - $300. Repairs can range from software updates to replacement of the onboard charger ($1000 - $3000+).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Malfunctioning Door Handles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EQS features flush-mounted door handles that present when the vehicle is unlocked. These handles can sometimes fail to deploy or retract properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door handle mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per handle, including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **MBUX Hyperscreen Glare**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While visually stunning, the massive MBUX Hyperscreen can produce significant glare in certain lighting conditions, making it difficult to see information.
    *   Solution: Applying an aftermarket anti-glare screen protector can help reduce glare. Some owners also adjust screen brightness settings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+ for an anti-glare screen protector.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rattling/Creaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or creaking noises emanating from the interior trim, particularly around the dashboard or door panels.
    *   Solution: Dealer inspection to identify the source of the noise. Solutions may involve tightening or replacing trim pieces, applying sound-deadening material, or lubricating contact points.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EQS 580 comes standard with air suspension. Problems can include the car not maintaining the correct ride height, leaning to one side, or displaying error messages related to the air suspension system.
    *   Solution: Dealer inspection to identify leaks, faulty sensors, or compressor issues. Component replacement (air struts, compressor, sensors) may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per corner, depending on the part needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQS 580 presents a mix of cutting-edge technology and potential reliability concerns. Electrical issues, particularly those related to the MBUX system and 12V battery drain, seem to be among the most common complaints. Suspension problems can also occur, although less frequently. While some issues can be resolved with software updates, others may require more costly repairs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially debilitating problems that can affect the vehicle's usability. While many issues are covered under warranty, the potential for out-of-pocket expenses exists, particularly as the vehicle ages.
