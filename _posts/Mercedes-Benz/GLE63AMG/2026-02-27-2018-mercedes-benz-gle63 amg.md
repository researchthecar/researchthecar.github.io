### Summary Verdict

The primary areas of concern tend to be related to its high-performance components, such as the twin-turbo V8 engine's turbochargers and cooling system, and the specialized AMG transmission. The AIRMATIC air suspension can also be a source of costly repairs if leaks develop. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also noted.
