### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLE63 AMG demonstrates a generally strong reliability profile, particularly concerning its core powertrain. The 4.0L twin-turbo V8 engine is robust, though isolated reports of wastegate actuator issues and coolant leaks can occur. The 9-speed automatic transmission is smooth but may occasionally exhibit shifting anomalies requiring software updates or internal attention. The advanced AIRMATIC suspension system, while providing excellent ride comfort and adjustability, is a potential source of costly repairs due to air spring leaks or compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the MBUX infotainment system's software and occasional 12V battery drain, are also noted. Exterior and interior components are largely reliable, with minor issues like headlight condensation and seat motor malfunctions being the most common. Overall, the GLE63 AMG offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with its high-performance and technologically advanced systems.
