**Introduction:**

The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE63 AMG is a high-performance luxury SUV that combines power and comfort. It is offered with two engine options: a 4.0L V8 biturbo with 563 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L V8 biturbo with 603 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.0L V8 Biturbo (563hp)**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** Can cause reduced engine performance, excessive oil consumption, and blue smoke from the exhaust. Requires replacement of the affected turbocharger. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Intake Valve Carbon Buildup:** Over time, carbon deposits can accumulate on the intake valves, reducing airflow and causing engine misfires and power loss. Requires disassembly of the engine and cleaning of the valves. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $800 - $1,500+

**4.0L V8 Biturbo (603hp)**

* **Engine Coolant Leak:** Can occur at the coolant hoses or gaskets, resulting in a drop in coolant levels and overheating. Requires identification and replacement of the leaking parts. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shift Hesitation or Jerking:** Occasional rough shifting or delayed shifts can indicate problems with the transmission fluid, sensors, or solenoids. May require transmission fluid changes, sensor replacements, or solenoid repairs. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+
* **Transmission Slipping:** Loss of power while driving can be caused by worn clutch packs or transmission gears. Requires major transmission repair or replacement. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $3,000 - $10,000+
* **Recall:** NHTSA Campaign Number 20T015: Transmission control unit software may not properly control gear shifts, increasing the risk of a crash

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure:** Compressor may fail, resulting in suspension drop or uneven ride height. Requires replacement of the air suspension compressor. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $2,000+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge:** Electrical system may discharge too quickly, causing difficulty starting the vehicle. Can be caused by parasitic battery draw or a faulty battery. Requires identification and устранение of the underlying cause. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $500+
* **Recall:** NHTSA Campaign Number 20T007: Passenger seat occupancy sensor may not properly detect passenger weight, possibly leading to incorrect airbag deployment

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight assemblies, causing reduced forward lighting. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $400+

**Interior**

* **Infotainment System Malfunction:** Slow response, freezing, or display issues may be caused by software bugs or hardware failures. Requires software updates or component replacements. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+
* **Recall:** NHTSA Campaign Number 20T027: Sun Visor attachment points may not be properly welded, increasing the risk of visor detachment during a crash

**Summary:**
