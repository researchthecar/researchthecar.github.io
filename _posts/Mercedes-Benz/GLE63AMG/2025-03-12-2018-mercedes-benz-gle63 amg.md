**Summary**

The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE63 AMG offers impressive performance and luxury but can present owners with potentially costly maintenance and repair bills. Engine oil leaks and turbocharger issues are common concerns, along with air suspension and electrical system problems. Transmission issues can range from minor rough shifting to major repairs.
