### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz C200 (W203) offers a compelling mix of luxury and performance, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common reliability concerns. The gasoline engines, particularly the M271, are prone to timing chain issues, while diesel variants can experience glow plug and injector problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the 5G-Tronic, may develop issues with their control modules or conductor plates. Electrically, the Body Control Module and power window regulators are known weak points. Suspension components like control arm bushings can wear out, and exterior elements like headlight lenses may degrade. Interior climate control and display issues are also reported. Despite these potential drawbacks, many issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, allowing the C200 to remain a desirable vehicle.
