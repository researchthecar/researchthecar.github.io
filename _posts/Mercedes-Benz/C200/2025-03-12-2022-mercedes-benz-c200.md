The 2022 Mercedes-Benz C200 is a luxury sedan offering a blend of style, technology, and performance. The C200 is equipped with a turbocharged 1.5-liter inline-4 engine producing around 204 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available in the 2022 C-Class range include more powerful gasoline engines, diesel options in some markets, and plug-in hybrid variants. Owners generally praise the C200 for its elegant interior, comfortable ride, and advanced technology features. However, some common criticisms include the complexity of the infotainment system, the relatively small rear seats, and occasional software glitches.
