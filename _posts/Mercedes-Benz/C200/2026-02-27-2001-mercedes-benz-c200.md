### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Mercedes-Benz C200 (W203) offers a premium experience for its time, but potential buyers should be aware of common reliability concerns. The engines, particularly the supercharged petrol variant, can experience issues with accessory belts and sensors. Diesel models may face injector seal leaks and glow plug problems. Automatic transmissions, while generally robust, can develop issues with their control modules and valve bodies, leading to costly repairs. Manual transmissions are less prone to major issues but clutch wear is a consideration. Suspension components like control arm bushings are known to wear, impacting ride and handling. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster faults, are not uncommon. Exterior rust, especially on lower body panels, requires attention. Interior wear and tear on high-contact areas is typical, and HVAC components like the blower motor resistor can fail. Despite these potential issues, many C200s have proven durable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
