The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF, while not a widely known model (likely referring to a specific RV built on a Mercedes-Benz chassis, perhaps a Sprinter van conversion), would typically be equipped with a diesel engine. Common engine options for Mercedes-Benz Sprinter-based RVs around that time would be the 3.0L V6 diesel engine producing around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the fuel efficiency and robust nature of the diesel engine. Common complaints for RVs built on the Sprinter chassis typically revolve around ride quality and maintenance costs of the diesel engine components. The engine is typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Summary**

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF, like many RVs built on the Sprinter chassis, may experience issues related to its diesel engine, transmission, suspension, and the RV-specific components. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the issue. Engine issues such as DPF clogging and EGR valve failure can be costly to address. Suspension problems can impact ride quality and handling. Electrical and interior issues can affect the usability and comfort of the RV. Careful inspection and preventative maintenance are essential to minimize potential problems.
