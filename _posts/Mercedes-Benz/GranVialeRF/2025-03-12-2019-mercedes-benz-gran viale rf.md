The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF is a high-end recreational vehicle built on a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter chassis. It boasts luxurious amenities and comfortable living spaces, making it ideal for extended road trips. While specific engine options for the Gran Viale RF built on the Sprinter chassis may vary depending on the conversion company, a common choice is the 3.0L V6 turbo diesel engine, producing approximately 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. It is typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its smooth ride, fuel efficiency for its size, and the quality of the interior appointments. Common complaints often revolve around the relatively high price point, occasional issues with the electronics of the Sprinter chassis, and limited storage space compared to larger RVs.

**Summary:**

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF, while luxurious, can present owners with a range of issues, primarily related to the underlying Sprinter chassis's engine, transmission, and electrical systems. The DEF system and potential for oil leaks in the diesel engine, along with rough shifting in the 7-speed transmission, are notable concerns. RV-specific systems like plumbing and water systems are often a point of concern for owners. The cost of repairs can vary significantly, ranging from minor sensor replacements to more substantial work on the transmission or DEF system. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle's service history and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any potential problems.
