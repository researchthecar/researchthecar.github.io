The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF, also known as the Sprinter in some markets, is a versatile van prized for its spaciousness and utility. While often configured as a cargo van, passenger van, or chassis cab for various upfits, its robust build and Mercedes-Benz engineering make it appealing. Available engines included a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel and a 3.0-liter V6 diesel engine. The 2.1L diesel produces around 161 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque. The V6 offers more power and refinement. Many owners appreciate the Sprinter's high roof, which allows for standing room inside, and its relatively good fuel economy for its size. Downsides often include the higher initial cost compared to other vans, and potential maintenance expenses associated with the Mercedes-Benz brand.

**Summary**
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF (Sprinter) is a capable van, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the diesel engines and associated emissions systems. Oil leaks, DPF problems, and electrical malfunctions are among the more common complaints. The sliding door mechanism and suspension components can also be prone to wear and tear. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, especially those involving the SAM or major engine components. Overall, thorough maintenance and addressing issues promptly are crucial to ensuring the longevity and reliability of this vehicle.
