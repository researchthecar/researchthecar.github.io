### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF, while a luxurious and capable vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of premium European vehicles of its age. Powertrain components, particularly the diesel engines and automatic transmissions, can be prone to issues like DPF problems, AdBlue system faults, and torque converter wear, requiring significant repair costs. The AirMatic suspension system is also a notable area for potential expense due to leaks and compressor failures. Electrical systems, especially the infotainment and sensor arrays, can also present intermittent problems. While the standard suspension and exterior/interior components are generally robust, owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs associated with its advanced systems. Regular servicing and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for maintaining reliability.
