The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF, more commonly known as the Marco Polo, is a camper van built on the Mercedes-Benz Vito chassis. It offers a compact and luxurious camping experience. While engine choices vary depending on the specific market, a common option is the 2.1L inline-4 diesel engine, producing around 136 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque. Other engines offered may include more powerful diesel variants. Transmission options commonly included a 6-speed manual or a 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission. Owners often praise its comfortable interior, efficient use of space, and Mercedes-Benz build quality. Criticisms often involve its relatively high price, limited storage compared to larger motorhomes, and occasional electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**2.1L Inline-4 Diesel**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from various engine seals, specifically around the valve cover gasket and oil pan gasket. This can lead to a burning oil smell and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals. Ensure proper torque specifications are followed during reassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, especially with frequent short trips, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Attempt a forced regeneration of the DPF. If that fails, the DPF may need to be cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC PLUS Automatic Transmission**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts between gears. Hesitation during acceleration, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement using the correct Mercedes-Benz specification fluid. If the problem persists, valve body issues should be investigated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunctions (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with air suspension, the system may exhibit sagging, failure to maintain ride height, or warning lights. This can be due to leaks in the air struts, compressor failure, or sensor issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the leak or component failure using a diagnostic scan tool. Replace the affected air strut, compressor, or sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning Sliding Door (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The power sliding door can fail to open or close properly. This can be due to issues with the motor, wiring harness, or latch mechanism.
    * Solution: Inspect the wiring harness for damage or corrosion. Test the motor and latch mechanism. Replace the faulty component.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when parked for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Disconnect or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Malfunctioning Refrigerator (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The refrigerator fails to cool properly or maintain a consistent temperature. This can be due to a faulty compressor, thermostat, or refrigerant leak.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Leaks around the windows or roof, especially during heavy rain. This can lead to water damage and mold growth inside the van.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and seal it with appropriate sealant or weatherstripping. Repair any water damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF, while offering a luxurious camping experience, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most prevalent issues seem to revolve around the engine (oil leaks, DPF), transmission (rough shifting), and electrical systems (battery drain, refrigerator, sliding door malfunctions). Depending on the specific issue, repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems before purchase. If the vehicle is equipped with air suspension, it should also be inspected for leaks and proper operation.
