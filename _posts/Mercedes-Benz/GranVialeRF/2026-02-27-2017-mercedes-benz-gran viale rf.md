### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale RF demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core mechanical components. Owners can expect a durable vehicle, but attention should be paid to potential issues with the diesel engines' emissions systems (DPF, EGR) and turbochargers, especially on higher-mileage examples. The automatic transmission, while generally robust, can occasionally suffer from torque converter or fluid leak issues. The air suspension system is a notable area for potential expense, with leaks in springs or compressor failures being the most common concerns. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also documented. While interior components are generally well-built, specific electrical motors for seat adjustment and climate control blend doors can fail. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for maintaining the long-term reliability of this premium vehicle.
