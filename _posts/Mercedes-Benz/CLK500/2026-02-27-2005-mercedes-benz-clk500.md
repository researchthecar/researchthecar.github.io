However, as with many German luxury vehicles of this era, potential buyers should be aware of common electrical gremlins and wear-related issues in the transmission and suspension. Leaking oil cooler seals and intake manifold gaskets are notable engine concerns. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while robust, can develop issues with its control module or conductor plate. Suspension components like control arm bushings are also prone to wear. Electrical issues, such as window regulators and headlight ballasts, are not uncommon. Interior displays can also suffer from pixel degradation. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the CLK500's reliability and enjoyment.
