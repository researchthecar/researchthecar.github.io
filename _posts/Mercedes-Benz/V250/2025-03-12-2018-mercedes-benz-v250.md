The 2018 Mercedes-Benz V250 is a versatile and luxurious van, often praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and premium features. However, like any vehicle, it's not without its potential problems. The V250 is typically equipped with a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel engine, producing around 190 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options were available depending on the market, including other diesel variants and potentially a gasoline engine in some regions. Owners often appreciate the V250's practicality and upscale feel, but some common complaints revolve around the complexity of its electronics, the cost of maintenance, and occasional issues with specific components.
