The 2020 Mercedes-Benz V250 is a luxury van known for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and high-end features. Engine options typically include a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel engine, available in different states of tune. The V250d variant, for example, produces around 190 horsepower and 440 Nm of torque. A common complaint is its relatively high price tag compared to competitors. Some owners appreciate the refined interior and smooth ride, while others find the infotainment system complex and the diesel engine noisy at times. The V-Class often utilizes a 7G-TRONIC PLUS or 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission.
