The 2019 Mercedes-Benz V250 is a luxury van known for its spaciousness, versatility, and comfortable ride. It's popular for both family use and business transportation. While offering a premium experience, owners have reported some common issues. The 2019 V250 was primarily available with a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel engine (OM651) producing around 190 horsepower and 440 Nm of torque, paired with a 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission. Other engine options could include different power outputs of the same diesel engine, or, depending on the market, a petrol engine. Owners often praise the V250 for its luxurious interior and flexible seating configurations but sometimes dislike its size and occasional electronic glitches.
