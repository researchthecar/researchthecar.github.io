The 2017 Mercedes-Benz V250 is a luxury multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) known for its spacious interior, refined ride, and versatility. While offering a premium experience, some owners have reported encountering specific issues. The V250 came with a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel engine producing around 190 horsepower and 440 Nm of torque, paired with a 7G-TRONIC PLUS automatic transmission. The V-Class is generally liked for its comfortable ride, flexible seating configurations, and high-quality interior. Some common dislikes include the somewhat firm suspension (depending on the configuration), occasional electronic glitches, and higher maintenance costs compared to some competitors.

**Summary:**

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz V250, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, can be prone to certain issues. The most prevalent issues seem to revolve around the engine (oil leaks and DPF problems), the transmission (rough shifting), the air suspension (if equipped), and electrical glitches. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely. Engine oil leaks and minor electrical glitches can be relatively inexpensive to fix. However, DPF replacement, transmission repairs, and air suspension problems can be significantly more expensive. Potential buyers should have the vehicle inspected by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
