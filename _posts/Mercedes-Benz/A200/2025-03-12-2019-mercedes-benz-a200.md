The 2019 Mercedes-Benz A200 is a popular luxury compact car known for its stylish design, technology-rich interior, and comfortable ride. The A200 is powered by a 1.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 163 horsepower and 250 Nm of torque. Other engine options available globally include a 1.5-liter diesel and a more powerful 2.0-liter gasoline engine. Transmission options primarily consist of a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Owners generally appreciate the A200's upscale cabin, fuel efficiency, and advanced features like the MBUX infotainment system. Some common complaints include the sometimes-complicated MBUX system, a slightly firm ride on certain road surfaces, and the availability of only front-wheel drive in some markets.
