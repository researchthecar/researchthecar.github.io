The 2020 Mercedes-Benz A200 is a popular compact luxury car known for its stylish design, comfortable interior, and advanced technology. The A200 typically comes equipped with a 1.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 163 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options available depending on the market, including a diesel variant (A200d). The primary transmission is a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic. Owners often praise the A200 for its fuel efficiency and user-friendly infotainment system (MBUX). However, some common complaints include the sometimes-firm ride and the higher cost of maintenance and repairs compared to non-luxury vehicles.
