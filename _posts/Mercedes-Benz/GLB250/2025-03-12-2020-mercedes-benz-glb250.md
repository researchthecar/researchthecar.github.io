The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 is a compact SUV known for its versatility, optional third-row seating, and upscale interior. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A GLB250 4MATIC version with all-wheel drive is also available. While the GLB250 offers a blend of practicality and luxury that many owners appreciate, common criticisms include a sometimes-firm ride and the potential for a somewhat cramped third row. The engine is paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.
