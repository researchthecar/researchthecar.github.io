The 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 is a compact SUV that offers a blend of practicality and luxury. It comes standard with a 2.0-liter inline-4 turbocharged engine producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. An AMG version, the GLB35, offers a more powerful engine. People generally appreciate the GLB250 for its spacious interior, especially the available third-row seating (though cramped), its upscale cabin, and its comfortable ride. Common complaints include the sometimes-hesitant transmission, the relatively high price for the segment, and the somewhat underwhelming fuel economy compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0-Liter Inline-4 Turbocharged**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings and potentially engine knocking or damage if the oil level is allowed to get too low.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly. Consult a Mercedes-Benz dealership for diagnosis and potential repair. This may involve replacing the PCV valve or piston rings if consumption is excessive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$5,000+ depending on the severity and the required repair (PCV valve replacement is less expensive, piston ring replacement is significantly more).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Malfunctioning MBUX System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) system can experience glitches, including freezing, slow response times, and inaccurate voice command recognition.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Mercedes-Benz can often resolve these issues. A hard reset of the system might also be necessary. In some cases, a hardware replacement might be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue) to $1,500+ (if hardware replacement is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle is not driven frequently.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic draws. Ensure all lights and accessories are turned off when the vehicle is not in use. Replace the battery if necessary. A software update may also be required to address any system issues that are causing the drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on battery type and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Panoramic Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the panoramic sunroof, including difficulty opening or closing, excessive noise during operation, or water leaks.
    *   Solution: Inspect the sunroof tracks and seals for debris or damage. Lubricate the tracks. In some cases, the sunroof motor or complete sunroof assembly might need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 (for cleaning/lubrication) to $1,000+ (for motor or assembly replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling or Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the noise and secure loose panels or components. Apply felt tape or other sound-deadening materials to prevent further noise.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if the issue is simple and can be addressed by the owner) to $100 - $500+ (if professional diagnosis and repair are required).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Malfunctioning Seat Heaters/Ventilators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters or ventilators failing to function properly or at all.
    * Solution: Check the fuse for the seat heater/ventilator circuit. If the fuse is good, the heating/cooling element or the control module may be faulty and require replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the faulty component.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic**

*   **Hesitation or Jerky Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 8-speed dual-clutch transmission can exhibit hesitation when accelerating from a stop or jerky shifts, especially at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A software update from Mercedes-Benz can sometimes improve the transmission's shifting behavior. In some cases, replacing the transmission fluid or valve body might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue) to $500+ (for fluid replacement) to $2,000+ (for valve body replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Experiencing a delay in acceleration after pressing the accelerator pedal, and/or a sensation of the transmission failing to properly engage a gear. This can also be accompanied by unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Have the transmission fluid level checked and topped off. Flush the transmission and replace the fluid, checking for metal shavings in the old fluid. If the fluid is dark or contains metal, the transmission may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on whether the transmission can be repaired.
    *   Recalls: None Found
