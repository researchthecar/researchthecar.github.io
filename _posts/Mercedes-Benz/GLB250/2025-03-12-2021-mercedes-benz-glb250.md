The 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 is a compact SUV offering a blend of practicality and luxury. The GLB250 comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the GLB250's spacious interior and available third-row seating (making it somewhat unique in its class), while others find the ride quality firm and the engine noise somewhat intrusive. Common dislikes also include the complicated infotainment system and some lower-quality interior materials in certain areas. A more powerful AMG GLB 35 is also available, with a tuned version of the 2.0-liter engine.

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil changes than typically expected. Symptoms include the need to add oil between scheduled services and potentially seeing the low oil level warning light.
    *   Solution: The dealer should perform an oil consumption test to verify the oil loss. If deemed excessive, potential repairs could range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings, or in more severe cases, a short block replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A few owners have reported premature turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a loss of power, whistling or whining noises from the engine bay, and potentially the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger assembly is the common fix. Ensure the replacement part is an OEM or an equivalent quality aftermarket unit.

    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) is sometimes the fix. If that doesn't work, the transmission fluid may need to be changed. In severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission replacement may be needed.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping can occur where the RPMs increase, but the vehicle doesn't accelerate, or the vehicle feels like it shifts into neutral on its own.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body may be needed. In more severe cases, complete transmission replacement may be needed.
