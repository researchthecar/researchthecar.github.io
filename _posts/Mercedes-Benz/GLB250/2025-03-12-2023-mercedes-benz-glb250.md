The 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLB250 is a compact luxury SUV offering a blend of practicality and Mercedes-Benz refinement. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4, producing 221 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the GLB250's spacious interior for its class, available third-row seating (though cramped), and upscale features. Common complaints often revolve around the sometimes-hesitant dual-clutch transmission, the firmer ride quality, and the relatively high price point for the segment.
