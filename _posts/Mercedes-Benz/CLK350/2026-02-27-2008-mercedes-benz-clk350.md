### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLK350 is a reliable luxury vehicle, particularly concerning its core mechanical components like the engine and transmission, when properly maintained. However, potential owners should be aware of specific issues that can arise, such as intake manifold runner flap failures and balance shaft gear wear in the 3.5L V6 engine, and valve body or torque converter problems in the 7G-TRONIC transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM module and window regulators, are also noted. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not universally experienced, and many CLK350s provide years of dependable service. Proactive maintenance and thorough pre-purchase inspections are recommended.
