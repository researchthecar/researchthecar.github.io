The 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQS AMG represents the pinnacle of electric performance and luxury. Boasting a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system, it produces a staggering 649 horsepower and 700 lb-ft of torque (or up to 751 hp and 752 lb-ft with Race Start). The non-AMG EQS models feature different powertrains, with the EQS 450+ offering rear-wheel drive and around 355 horsepower, while the EQS 580 4MATIC delivers all-wheel drive and around 536 horsepower. People praise the EQS AMG for its exhilarating acceleration, plush interior, and cutting-edge technology. However, some criticisms include the high price tag, complicated infotainment system, and polarizing exterior styling.

**Electric Motor**

**Dual-Motor (EQS AMG)**

*   **Inconsistent Power Delivery/Sudden Power Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing intermittent or abrupt loss of power, particularly during periods of high demand (e.g., rapid acceleration or uphill driving). The issue manifests as a sudden decrease in available power, sometimes accompanied by error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: This issue can often be resolved with a software update. In some cases, replacing the battery pack is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 if it's a software issue under warranty. Battery replacements can be extremely costly, potentially exceeding $20,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Voltage Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature degradation of the high-voltage battery leading to reduced range. Symptoms may include the car not charging to full capacity, lower than expected range, and error messages related to battery health.
    *   Solution: The solution may range from a software update to manage battery usage more efficiently, to individual module replacement, or a full battery replacement if degradation is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Battery module replacement could range from $5,000-$10,000, while a full battery replacement could exceed $20,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AMG's air suspension system, designed for both comfort and performance, can experience issues such as sagging, uneven ride height, or failure to adjust properly. Error messages related to the suspension system are often displayed.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis typically involves checking for leaks in the air springs, faulty sensors, or a malfunctioning air compressor. Replacement of the affected components is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2,000+, depending on the component that needs replacement. Air springs are often the most expensive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MBUX Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MBUX system is known for its complexity and feature-rich interface. Some owners have reported experiencing glitches such as screen freezes, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, and software crashes.
    *   Solution: Simple resets may sometimes resolve minor issues. However, more persistent problems may require software updates or, in rare cases, hardware replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Most software updates are covered under warranty. Hardware replacements (e.g., head unit) can range from $1,000-$3,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (Parking Sensors, Driver Assist Systems)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EQS AMG relies on numerous sensors for parking assistance, lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, and other driver-assist functions. Malfunctions in these sensors can lead to warning lights, error messages, and the deactivation of safety features.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves identifying the faulty sensor through diagnostic tools. Replacement is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor, depending on the type and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Charging Port Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty with the charging port latching or releasing the charging cable, failure to initiate charging, or error messages during the charging process.
    *   Solution: Inspect the charging port for debris or damage. If the issue persists, the charging port mechanism may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sensor Alignment Issues (Radar/Camera)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the front bumper or grille is impacted, even slightly, the radar and camera sensors used for adaptive cruise control and other driver-assistance features can become misaligned. This results in system malfunctions and error messages.
    *   Solution: Recalibration of the sensors using specialized equipment. In severe cases, physical realignment or sensor replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for recalibration, higher if replacement is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the electric seat motors, preventing the seat from adjusting properly (forward, backward, up, down, or lumbar support).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty seat motor or the entire seat track assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+, depending on the specific motor and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Mercedes-Benz EQS AMG, while a technological marvel, has shown some common issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the electric motor's power delivery and the high-voltage battery, which can be extremely costly to repair. Electrical gremlins within the MBUX system and sensor malfunctions are also relatively common. While most of these issues are likely covered under warranty initially, potential owners should be aware of the potential for expensive repairs down the line, particularly concerning the battery.
