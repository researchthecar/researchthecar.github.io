The 2024 Mercedes-Benz GLC43 AMG is a performance-oriented compact SUV that sits between the standard GLC models and the high-performance GLC63 AMG. It boasts a handcrafted AMG-enhanced 2.0L inline-4 turbo engine with hybrid assist. This engine produces 416 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. While owners generally praise its sporty handling, luxurious interior, and distinctive styling, some common complaints revolve around the complex technology, firm ride, and potential reliability issues. Other engine options for the 2024 GLC class include the standard 2.0L inline-4 turbo (GLC 300), and later in the model year, the GLC63 S E Performance with a more powerful hybrid system. All GLC models utilize a 9-speed automatic transmission.
