### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz GL63 AMG is a powerful and luxurious SUV, but its performance-oriented nature and complex systems mean potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 5.5L twin-turbo V8 engine can experience issues like turbocharger failure and coolant leaks, while the AMG transmission may develop problems with its control module or torque converter. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, the potential for significant repair costs on the powertrain and suspension systems should be factored into ownership considerations.
