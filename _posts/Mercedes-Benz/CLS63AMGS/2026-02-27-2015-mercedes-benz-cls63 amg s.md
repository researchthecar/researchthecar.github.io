### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG S is a formidable performance vehicle with a generally robust mechanical foundation. The primary areas that may require attention are related to its advanced AIRMATIC suspension system, particularly air spring and compressor failures, and potential issues with the twin-turbocharged V8 engine's wastegate actuators and PCV system. The AMG SPEEDSHIFT transmission, while strong, can occasionally exhibit torque converter seal leaks or mechatronics unit problems. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not universally present and often stem from the complexity inherent in a high-performance luxury car. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maintaining the CLS63 AMG S's reliability and performance.
