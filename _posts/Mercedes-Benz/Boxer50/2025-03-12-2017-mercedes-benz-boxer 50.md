The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer 50 is a colloquial term) is a versatile van popular for commercial and recreational use. While known for its durability and functionality, certain issues have been reported by owners. Available engine options include the 2.1L Inline-4 Turbo Diesel (OM651) producing approximately 161 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque and the 3.0L V6 Turbo Diesel (OM642) producing around 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC). Owners often praise the Sprinter for its spaciousness, payload capacity, and fuel efficiency (particularly with the I4 diesel). However, some common complaints include the cost of maintenance and repairs, particularly for specialized components, and certain electrical gremlins.
