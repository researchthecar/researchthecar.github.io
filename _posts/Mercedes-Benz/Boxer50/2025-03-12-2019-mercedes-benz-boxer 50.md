The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer 50 is a less common designation) is a popular choice for commercial and recreational use, prized for its versatility and spaciousness. Engine options for the 2019 Sprinter include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine producing around 188 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 3.0L turbo-diesel V6 engine producing approximately 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. The gasoline engine is typically paired with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission, while the diesel often comes with a 7G-TRONIC 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter for its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and refined interior. However, some common complaints include the higher price point, potential for electronic glitches, and the cost of maintenance and repairs.
