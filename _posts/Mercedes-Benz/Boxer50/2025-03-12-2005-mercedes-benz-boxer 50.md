The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Boxer 50, also known as the Sprinter in some markets, is a light commercial van popular for its versatility and cargo capacity. The 2005 model year offered several engine options, including diesel variants, such as the 2.7L inline-5 cylinder diesel engine. There were a variety of transmission options available, most commonly an automatic transmission and a manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sprinter's cargo space and reliability, but common complaints revolve around repair costs and some specific component failures. This breakdown covers some of the most frequently reported issues.

**Transmission**

**Automatic Transmission**
* **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips between gears, hesitates when shifting, or shifts harshly.
    * Solution: Fluid flush may help with minor issues. Valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary for more severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights not working, sensors malfunctioning, or starting issues. This is often due to chafing or corrosion of the wiring harness.

**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz Boxer 50 (Sprinter) is generally a reliable van, but owners should be aware of potential issues, especially with the diesel engine and transmission. The "Black Death" injector seal leaks and turbocharger failures on the 2.7L diesel can be costly to repair. Electrical problems and rust are also common concerns. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or turbocharger replacements, can be significant expenses. Pre-purchase inspections are recommended to identify potential problems before buying a used 2005 Sprinter.
