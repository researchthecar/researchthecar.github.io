The 2014 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500, often referred to as the Boxer 50 in some markets, is a popular choice for commercial use due to its spacious cargo area and versatility. Engine options for the 2014 Sprinter 2500 include a 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel engine producing around 161 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0-liter V6 diesel engine generating approximately 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. The Sprinter is generally praised for its high roof options and cargo capacity. Some common complaints include the cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as some reliability concerns. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.
