### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz Boxer 50 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, with its diesel engines being a strong point. However, potential owners should be aware of common issues such as turbocharger and EGR problems in the 2.3L JTDm, and glow plug/injector issues in the 2.8L JTDm. Transmission reliability is good, though clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Suspension components like leaf springs and shock absorbers can require attention. Electrical gremlins, particularly with wiring harnesses, and rust on exterior panels are also points to inspect. Interior wear, especially on seats and HVAC blower motors, can occur. Overall, with diligent maintenance and inspection of these known weak points, the Boxer 50 remains a capable and dependable commercial vehicle.
