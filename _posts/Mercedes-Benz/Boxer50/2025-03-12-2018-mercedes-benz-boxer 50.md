The 2018 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter (Boxer 50 refers to the chassis type in certain markets but is generally understood as the Sprinter) is a versatile van known for its cargo capacity and customizable configurations. The 2018 Sprinter offered several engine options, including a 2.1L inline-4 diesel engine producing around 161 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 diesel engine producing approximately 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. A gasoline powered 2.0L inline-4 was available, producing around 188 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The 2.1L diesel was typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic Plus), while the V6 diesel and 2.0L gasoline engine were often paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Sprinter's reliability and functionality, though common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs and specific component failures.

**Summary**

The 2018 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter can be a reliable and versatile work van, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the diesel engines. Oil leaks and DPF problems are fairly common in the 2.1L diesel, while the 3.0L diesel is known for turbocharger and oil cooler failures. Suspension issues and electrical problems are also possibilities. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the specific issue, but major repairs, like turbocharger or DPF replacement, can be quite expensive. Overall, while not every Sprinter will experience these problems, due diligence and thorough inspection are recommended when considering a used 2018 model.
