The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Boxer 50, also known as the Sprinter in many markets, is a light commercial van prized for its versatility and cargo capacity. This model year offered various engine and transmission options. However, the "Boxer 50" designation specifically refers to a model common in European markets, often equipped with smaller diesel engines. While specific performance figures vary based on the exact engine code and market, a common diesel option might produce around 95-120 horsepower and 200-250 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the Sprinter's spacious interior and maneuverability in urban environments, but some have reported issues with reliability and the cost of maintenance.
