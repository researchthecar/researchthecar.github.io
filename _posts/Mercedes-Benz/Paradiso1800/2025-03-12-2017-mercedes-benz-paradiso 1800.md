The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Paradiso 1800 is a high-end luxury touring coach primarily used for long-distance passenger transport. While specific engine and transmission options are often customized based on the buyer's needs, it commonly features Mercedes-Benz diesel engines paired with automatic transmissions. Performance figures vary depending on the specific engine chosen, but typical diesel engines in this class produce around 400-500 horsepower and 1300-1600 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the Paradiso 1800 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and advanced safety features. Common complaints usually revolve around the high maintenance costs associated with commercial vehicles and the complexity of the onboard electronic systems.
