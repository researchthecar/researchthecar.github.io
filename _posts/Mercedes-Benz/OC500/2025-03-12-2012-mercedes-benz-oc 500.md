The 2012 Mercedes-Benz OC 500 is a chassis typically used for buses and coaches, not a consumer vehicle. Because of this, the complaints and issues are different than a standard passenger car. These vehicles are typically equipped with diesel engines. While exact engine and transmission options may vary based on the specific bus or coach builder, common engine options could include Mercedes-Benz diesel engines, and transmissions from ZF or similar manufacturers are frequently used. Generally, these vehicles are appreciated for their robust construction and suitability for heavy-duty applications, but disliked for their complexity and the specialized maintenance they require.

**Engine**

**Mercedes-Benz Diesel Engine (Specific Engine Type Varies)**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Running**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, decreased power, and potentially illuminated check engine light. Could be accompanied by excessive black smoke.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the root cause, which could be faulty fuel injectors, air leaks in the intake system, or issues with the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system. Replace faulty components and perform necessary calibrations or adaptations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from various points, overheating, low coolant levels, and potential damage to the engine due to overheating.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the leak (radiator, hoses, water pump, etc.) and replace the faulty component. Pressure test the system to confirm the repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the part leaking.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF Automatic Transmission (Specific Model Varies)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, the transmission slipping out of gear, or a general lack of smooth operation.
    *   Solution: Inspect transmission fluid level and condition. If low or contaminated, perform a fluid and filter change. If the issue persists, further diagnostics are needed, potentially involving valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6000+ depending on the severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission overheating warning light, reduced power, and potential damage to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission cooler for blockage or damage. Replace the transmission cooler if necessary. Address any underlying issues causing excessive heat generation within the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride height, the vehicle leaning to one side, the air compressor running continuously, and potential failure of the air springs.
    *   Solution: Inspect the air springs, air lines, compressor, and ride height sensors for leaks or damage. Replace faulty components and calibrate the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks and Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and a generally uncomfortable ride.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shocks and struts. Consider replacing all shocks and struts simultaneously for optimal performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Electrical malfunctions, intermittent failures of various systems, and difficulty diagnosing the root cause.
    *   Solution: Thoroughly inspect the wiring harness for damage, corrosion, or loose connections. Repair or replace damaged sections of the harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on complexity and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions in engine management, transmission control, or other systems due to faulty sensors (e.g., ABS sensors, speed sensors, temperature sensors).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor that is failing and replace it with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on location and accessibility.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the body panels, chassis, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust, repair any damaged metal, and apply rust-resistant coatings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inadequate heating or cooling, unusual noises from the HVAC system, and failure of the blower motor.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the HVAC malfunction. This could involve replacing the blower motor, repairing or replacing the compressor, or addressing leaks in the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the faulty component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Mechanism Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty adjusting seats, broken seat frames, or malfunctioning seat motors (if equipped with power seats).
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the faulty seat mechanism components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz OC 500, being a commercial chassis, faces issues related to heavy use and complex systems. Engine and transmission problems, especially those related to the diesel engines and ZF transmissions, can be costly. Suspension and electrical issues also add to the potential maintenance burden. The severity and cost of repairs vary significantly depending on the specific issue, but owners should be prepared for potentially high repair bills, especially as the vehicle ages.
