The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Coraza S2, also known as the SLK-Class, offered a blend of luxury and sporty performance in a compact roadster. Engine options included a 1.8L turbocharged inline-4 (SLK250) producing 201 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 (SLK350) producing 302 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.5L AMG V8 (SLK55 AMG) producing 415 hp and 398 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). Owners often praise the car's stylish design, retractable hardtop, and comfortable interior. Some criticisms include limited rear visibility, a somewhat firm ride (especially on models with sport suspension), and the potential for expensive repairs as the car ages.
