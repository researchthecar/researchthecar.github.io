The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLK63 AMG is a performance-oriented coupe and cabriolet that blends luxury with a potent engine. The most desirable feature of this vehicle is the high-powered engine, but many people dislike the low gas mileage of the engine. While other CLK models offered smaller V6 and V8 engines, the CLK63 AMG boasts a hand-built 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 475 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. This engine is mated to a 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission. Common complaints revolve around maintenance costs associated with an AMG model and potential issues stemming from its performance-focused components.

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLK63 AMG, while a desirable performance vehicle, can be prone to some costly repairs. The M156 engine, in particular, can suffer from camshaft wear and head bolt failures, leading to significant expenses. Transmission issues, particularly with the valve body, are also relatively common. Suspension problems are also present, but depend on if the vehicle has airmatic suspension. Electrical gremlins related to the EIS and SAM modules can also occur. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in higher maintenance costs when considering this vehicle.
