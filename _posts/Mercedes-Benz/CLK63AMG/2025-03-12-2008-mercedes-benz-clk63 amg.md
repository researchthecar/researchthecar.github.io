The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLK63 AMG is a high-performance coupe that packs a serious punch. The main engine option is the hand-built 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine, producing 475 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. This engine is paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). Some owners love the raw power and sound of the V8, while others dislike the relatively poor fuel economy and potential for expensive repairs. The CLK63 AMG stands out for its aggressive styling and luxurious interior.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (also known as camshaft sprocket bolts) are prone to failure. This can lead to engine damage if not addressed. Symptoms include a ticking or knocking noise from the engine, especially on startup or when cold. In severe cases, the engine can stall or experience reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replace the original camshaft adjuster bolts with updated, stronger bolts. The updated bolts are a revised design intended to prevent breakage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter/Tappet Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The hydraulic valve lifters (tappets) in the M156 engine can sometimes develop issues, leading to excessive ticking or knocking noises, particularly when the engine is cold or at idle. This can be caused by wear or oil starvation to the lifters.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected valve lifters. In some cases, a full top-end rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+ (depending on the number of lifters needing replacement and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold gaskets can deteriorate over time, leading to vacuum leaks. Symptoms include rough idle, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 7G-Tronic transmission's valve body can experience wear and tear, leading to erratic shifting, harsh gear changes, slipping, or failure to shift altogether.
    *   Solution: The valve body can be replaced or rebuilt. In some cases, a complete transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate, which is part of the valve body, can fail. This can cause the transmission to go into limp mode, resulting in limited gear selection and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replace the conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with air suspension, the air struts can leak, leading to a sagging ride height, especially overnight. The air compressor can also fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air struts or the faulty air compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut; $500 - $1,200 for the compressor
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **ABC (Active Body Control) Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ABC suspension system is known for being complex and prone to issues. Common problems include leaks in the hydraulic lines, pump failures, and strut failures.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the leaking hydraulic lines, replace the pump, or replace the struts. A complete flush and replacement of the ABC fluid is also often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, depending on the specific component needing repair or replacement. Can range from $500 for a simple hose repair to $3,000+ for a pump or strut replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EIS can fail, preventing the car from starting or causing intermittent electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the EIS. This often requires reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM units (front and rear) control various electrical functions. They can sometimes fail, leading to issues with lights, wipers, or other electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty SAM unit. Requires programming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary:**

The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLK63 AMG, while offering exhilarating performance, is known for potential issues with its engine (specifically the M156 V8), transmission, and, if equipped, the air or ABC suspension. The camshaft adjuster bolt issue is a major concern due to the potential for significant engine damage. Electrical issues, such as EIS and SAM failures, can also occur. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or suspension work. Due to the age and complexity of these vehicles, a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Mercedes-Benz mechanic is highly recommended.
