The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE550e is a plug-in hybrid SUV that combines luxury with efficiency. The GLE550e features a 3.0-liter V6 biturbo engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 436 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2017 GLE include a 3.5L V6, a 3.0L biturbo V6, a 4.7L biturbo V8, and a 5.5L biturbo V8. Transmission options include a 7-speed automatic or 9-speed automatic. Owners often praise its comfortable ride, luxurious interior, and fuel efficiency in hybrid mode. Some common dislikes include the complexity of the infotainment system, the higher price point compared to non-hybrid models, and limited all-electric range.

**Electric Motor**

**3.0L V6 biturbo + Electric Motor**
* **Battery Capacity Degradation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Over time, the high-voltage battery's ability to hold a charge diminishes, leading to a reduced all-electric driving range and a decrease in overall fuel efficiency. Some owners report significantly lower range than the original EPA estimates.
    * Solution: Battery replacement is the primary solution. Some owners have reported success with software updates that recalibrate the battery management system, but this is not a guaranteed fix.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $10,000 - $20,000+ for battery replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Hybrid System Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: A warning light illuminates on the dashboard, accompanied by a message indicating a problem with the hybrid system. Symptoms can include reduced power, inability to switch to electric-only mode, and erratic engine behavior.
    * Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is required to identify the specific component causing the issue (e.g., hybrid control module, inverter, electric motor). Repair may involve replacing the faulty component or reprogramming the system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+, depending on the component
    * Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**3.0L V6 biturbo**
* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations, including the valve cover gaskets, timing chain cover, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, the smell of burning oil, and low oil levels.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals is the typical solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+, depending on the location and severity of the leak
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic 7-Speed Automatic**
* **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing rough or delayed shifts, particularly when shifting between gears at lower speeds. Hesitation can also occur when accelerating from a stop or when downshifting.
    * Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate the problem. If the issue persists, further diagnosis may be required to identify potential problems with the valve body or other internal components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+, depending on the severity and required repairs
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure (Airmatic)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Airmatic suspension system can experience failures, leading to a sagging vehicle, uneven ride height, and error messages on the dashboard. Problems can arise from faulty air struts, a malfunctioning air compressor, or leaks in the air lines.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty components is the common solution. This may involve replacing one or more air struts, the air compressor, or repairing/replacing the air lines.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,500 for compressor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Issues (COMAND)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The COMAND infotainment system can experience a variety of issues, including freezing, slow response times, and display malfunctions. Bluetooth connectivity problems and navigation errors are also common complaints.
    * Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. If the problem persists, replacement of the COMAND unit may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 for software updates, $500 - $2,000+ for unit replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Parking Sensors, Blind Spot Monitoring)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors can malfunction, leading to inaccurate readings or system failures. Common examples include parking sensors that provide false alarms, blind spot monitoring systems that fail to detect vehicles, and lane departure warning systems that operate erratically.
    * Solution: Diagnosis is required to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor is the typical solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can sometimes fail, leading to difficulty opening or closing the sunroof, unusual noises during operation, or water leaks.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, track, or seals may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Adaptive Headlight Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The adaptive headlights, which are designed to adjust their beam pattern based on driving conditions, can experience malfunctions. Symptoms include headlights that fail to turn, flicker, or aim improperly.
    * Solution: Diagnosis is needed to determine the cause. The issue may be due to a faulty headlight bulb, a defective control module, or a problem with the wiring harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+

**Summary**

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE550e, while offering a luxurious driving experience and fuel efficiency, can present owners with several potential issues. The hybrid system components, particularly the battery, are a significant concern due to their high replacement cost and potential for degradation. Suspension problems and electrical issues, such as infotainment malfunctions, are also prevalent. While the severity and cost of these issues vary, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor them into their purchasing decision. Addressing issues, especially battery degradation, can cost upwards of $10,000+
