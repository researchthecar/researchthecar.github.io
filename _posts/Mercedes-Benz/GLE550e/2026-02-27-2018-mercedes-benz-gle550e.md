### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLE550e, while generally well-built, presents potential reliability concerns primarily related to its complex hybrid powertrain and optional AIRMATIC suspension. The hybrid battery and associated electronics are significant cost factors if issues arise. Transmission issues, though not rampant, can be costly to repair. The AIRMATIC suspension, while providing a superior ride, is also a known area for potential expensive repairs like strut leaks or compressor failure. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system, can be an annoyance. Owners should be prepared for potentially higher maintenance costs compared to non-hybrid or non-air-suspended vehicles, especially as the vehicle ages and mileage increases.
