The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLS350 is a stylish four-door coupe that offers a blend of luxury and performance. In addition to the CLS350, other engine options included the CLS500/CLS550 (depending on the market), and the high-performance CLS63 AMG. The CLS350 features a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing approximately 272 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the CLS for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior. Common complaints include higher maintenance costs compared to other vehicles in its class and some electrical issues. This particular version of the vehicle was only offered with one transmission option.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating. Often caused by oil sludge buildup.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

*   **Intake Manifold Runner Flap Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, rough idle, check engine light. The intake manifold runner flaps control airflow into the engine, and failure of the motor can disrupt this.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold runner flap motor or the entire intake manifold assembly if the motor is not available separately.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (depending on whether the motor can be replaced separately)

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (7-Speed Automatic)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at low speeds; difficulty shifting; unusual noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, transmission slipping, getting stuck in a gear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body may be required. Sometimes cleaning and refurbishment of the valve body are sufficient.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ (depending on the severity and whether replacement or repair is needed)

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission stuck in limp mode, inability to shift gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the conductor plate inside the transmission. This usually requires dropping the transmission pan and replacing the filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500+

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, ride height not adjusting properly, compressor running constantly, "Visit Workshop" message on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty component(s), such as air struts, compressor, or valve block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+ per air strut, $500 - $1500+ for the compressor, $300 - $800+ for the valve block.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a few days of being fully charged, difficulty starting the car.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the parasitic draw by systematically checking each electrical circuit. Common culprits include the COMAND system, seat control modules, or alarm system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+ (depending on the complexity and the component causing the draw)

*   **COMAND System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, inability to read CDs/DVDs, navigation issues, Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software update, replacement of the COMAND unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the severity and whether repair or replacement is required)

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Key not recognized, inability to start the car, steering wheel lock malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EIS module and potentially reprogramming of the keys.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust bubbles forming on the fenders, doors, and around the trunk lid.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, bodywork, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ per panel, depending on the severity.

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof not opening or closing smoothly, unusual noises during operation, water leaks.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the sunroof tracks, repair or replace the sunroof motor, or replace damaged components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+

*   **Seat Control Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat not moving, memory functions not working.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty seat control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Recalls:**
*   2017080012 - Rectification of vehicles due to possible malfunction of emergency call system.
*   2017080016 - Rectification of vehicles due to the insufficient corrosion resistance of the brake booster.
*   2019040003 - Rectification of vehicles due to the incorrect positioning of the emergency call system antenna.
*   2019060002 - Rectification of vehicles due to possible leak on fuel filter flange.
*   2020020009 - Rectification of vehicles due to possible impairment of the crash sensors.
*   2020030006 - Rectification of vehicles due to a possible problem with the communication between the engine control unit and the central gateway module.

**Summary**

The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLS350, while admired for its styling and luxury, can present owners with a range of potential issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly concerning the camshaft adjusters, intake manifold, torque converter and valve body, can be costly to address. Suspension issues, if equipped with Airmatic, can also be expensive. Electrical issues like battery drain, COMAND malfunctions, and EIS failures can add to the maintenance burden. Body rust may also develop in some climates. Overall, owning a 2008 CLS350 requires budgeting for potentially significant repair costs to keep the vehicle in good working order.
