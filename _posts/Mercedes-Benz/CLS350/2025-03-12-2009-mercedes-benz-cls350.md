The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLS350 is a stylish four-door coupe offering a blend of luxury and sporty performance. While the CLS350 came standard with a 3.5L V6 engine producing around 272 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission, other engine options available globally included more powerful V8 variants. Owners generally praise the car's distinctive design, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior. Common complaints often revolve around higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury brands, complex electronics that can be prone to issues, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (M272)**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor performance, engine misfires, and potential illumination of the check engine light. Error codes related to camshaft position can be read using an OBD2 scanner.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the number of solenoids replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Balance Shaft Sprocket Wear (Early M272 Engines)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine noise (ticking or rattling), rough idling, and potential check engine light illumination. This is more prevalent in earlier M272 engines (pre-2008), but still a possibility. Error codes are related to camshaft/crankshaft correlation.
    *   Solution: Engine disassembly and replacement of the balance shaft sprocket and potentially the timing chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ due to the extensive labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at low speeds. The transmission may also hesitate when shifting, and you may hear unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on whether the torque converter is replaced or rebuilt.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and potential slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle sits lower than normal on one or more corners, the Airmatic pump runs excessively, and a warning message appears on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air spring(s). Addressing leaks in the air lines or the compressor may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per air spring, depending on location and labor. Compressor replacement can add $500 - $1,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose steering or wandering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints (often requires replacing the entire control arm).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per control arm.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the car, the key may not turn in the ignition, or the car may not recognize the key.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EIS unit and reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical malfunctions, such as lights not working, wipers malfunctioning, or other electrical components failing. Can be caused by water intrusion.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the specific issue and replacement or reprogramming of the faulty SAM unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the SAM unit and the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Door Panels/Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust bubbling under the paint, particularly on the lower sections of the doors and around the wheel arches.
    *   Solution: Rust removal, bodywork, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per panel depending on the severity and the quality of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may not open or close properly, may make grinding noises, or may become stuck.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLS350 offers a luxurious driving experience but can be susceptible to several common issues. Engine problems like camshaft adjuster solenoid failure and, more seriously, balance shaft wear can be expensive to fix. Transmission issues with the 7G-Tronic, such as torque converter problems and valve body malfunctions, are also prevalent. Airmatic suspension leaks (if equipped) can contribute to significant repair costs. Electrical problems stemming from the EIS or SAM units can lead to various malfunctions. Furthermore, exterior rust and sunroof malfunctions are additional concerns. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in potential maintenance costs when considering this vehicle. The severity of the issues ranges from minor electrical glitches to major mechanical repairs, with costs potentially exceeding several thousand dollars for some problems. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
