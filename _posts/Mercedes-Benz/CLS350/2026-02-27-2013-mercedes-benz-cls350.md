### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz CLS350 offers a compelling blend of style and performance. While its core powertrain is generally robust, potential buyers should be aware of specific issues that can arise, particularly concerning the timing chain tensioners on the M276 engine and potential leaks. The 7-speed transmission can sometimes exhibit shifting anomalies. If equipped with the AirMatic suspension, be prepared for the possibility of costly repairs related to air struts or the compressor.
