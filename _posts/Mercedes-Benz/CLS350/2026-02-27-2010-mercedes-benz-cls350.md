### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz CLS350 offers a compelling blend of style and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 3.5L V6 engine (M272) is prone to issues with the intake manifold runner flaps and balance shaft gears, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission, while generally smooth, can suffer from torque converter, valve body, or TCM problems. Optional air suspension systems are a known weak point, with leaks and compressor failures being common. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the SAM module, can also manifest. Despite these potential issues, many CLS350s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to emerging problems. Thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
