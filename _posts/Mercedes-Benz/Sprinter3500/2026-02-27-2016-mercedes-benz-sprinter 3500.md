### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly for its class. The diesel engines, while powerful, can be prone to issues related to emissions systems like the DPF and EGR valve, especially if not maintained or driven under conditions that don't allow for proper regeneration. Turbocharger problems are also a possibility. The automatic transmission is generally dependable, though fluid leaks and torque converter issues can arise. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are subject to wear due to the van's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are not uncommon in high-mileage vehicles. Exterior concerns primarily revolve around potential rust, and interior issues are less frequent, with HVAC blower motors being a notable component that can fail. Regular maintenance and addressing warning lights promptly are key to maximizing the longevity and reliability of the Sprinter 3500.
