### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly for its class. The diesel engines, while powerful and efficient, can be prone to DPF and AdBlue system issues, especially with inconsistent driving patterns. Transmission concerns are generally minor, often resolved with maintenance or software updates. Suspension components like leaf springs may require attention on heavily used vehicles. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and potential battery drains, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Regular maintenance, adherence to DPF regeneration cycles, and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for maximizing the longevity and reliability of the Sprinter 3500.
