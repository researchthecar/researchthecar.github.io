### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 is a workhorse van that generally performs well. The most frequently reported issues revolve around the diesel engine's emissions system (DPF and EGR), and potential turbocharger problems. Transmission issues, while less common, can include leaks and torque converter problems. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks can wear out, especially under heavy use. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM, and rust formation on the body are also points to monitor. Regular maintenance, proactive inspection of the emissions system, and addressing rust early are key to maintaining the long-term reliability of this commercial vehicle.
