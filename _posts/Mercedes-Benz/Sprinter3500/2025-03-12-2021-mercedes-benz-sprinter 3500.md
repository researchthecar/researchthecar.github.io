The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 is a popular commercial van known for its versatility and customization options. It's often praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available technology. However, some owners have reported issues, which can vary depending on the configuration. Engine options include a 2.0L I4 Turbocharged gasoline engine producing 188 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 Turbocharged diesel engine producing 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engine options are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While the Sprinter offers a range of configurations to suit various needs, some common complaints include electrical glitches, issues with the emissions system in diesel models, and problems with the sliding door mechanism. Some drivers like that there are so many ways to customize the vehicle to suit their needs. Some drivers don't like the cost of maintenance on the vehicle.
