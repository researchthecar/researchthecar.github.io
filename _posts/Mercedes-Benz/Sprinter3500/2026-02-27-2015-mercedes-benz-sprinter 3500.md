### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 generally offers good reliability for its class, with the powertrains being a strong point. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and AdBlue systems on the diesel engines, particularly with the 2.1L variant. The 7-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit shifting problems. Electrical gremlins, often related to the Body Control Module, and wear on suspension components like leaf springs are also noted. Interior wear on high-use areas like seats is common in commercial applications. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for maintaining the longevity and reliability of this workhorse van.
