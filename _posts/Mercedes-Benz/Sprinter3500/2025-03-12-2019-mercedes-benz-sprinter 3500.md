The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 is a popular choice for businesses and individuals needing a versatile and capable van. This model year offered several engine and transmission options, including a 3.0L V6 diesel engine producing 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available include a 2.0L gasoline engine. Owners often praise the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride (especially with upgraded suspension), and numerous customization options. However, common complaints include the high purchase price, relatively poor fuel economy (especially with the diesel engine), and potential for expensive repairs.
