The 2022 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 is a popular choice for commercial use and camper van conversions due to its spacious cargo area, versatile configurations, and robust build quality. Engine options for the 2022 model include a 2.0L Inline-4 Turbocharged Diesel engine producing 161 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 Turbocharged Diesel engine producing 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. The vehicle is generally praised for its comfortable ride (especially with upgraded suspension), high roof options, and customization potential.
