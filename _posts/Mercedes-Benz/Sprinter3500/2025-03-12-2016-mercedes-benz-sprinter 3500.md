The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 is a popular choice for commercial use, recreational vehicle conversions, and passenger transport. Engine options include a 2.1L inline-4 diesel (161 hp, 266 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.0L V6 diesel (188 hp, 325 lb-ft of torque). The 2.1L is generally paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L uses a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the Sprinter for its spacious interior, versatility, and fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.1L engine). Common complaints include expensive maintenance and repairs, some reliability issues, and a relatively firm ride.
