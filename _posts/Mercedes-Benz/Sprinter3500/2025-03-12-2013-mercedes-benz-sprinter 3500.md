**Summary**

The 2013 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 can be a reliable workhorse, but potential owners should be aware of common issues. Engine problems like DPF clogging (2.1L I4) and oil cooler leaks (3.0L V6) can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and valve body, are also a concern. Suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior issues exist as well. While the Sprinter offers great utility, the potential for costly repairs necessitates thorough inspection and maintenance.
