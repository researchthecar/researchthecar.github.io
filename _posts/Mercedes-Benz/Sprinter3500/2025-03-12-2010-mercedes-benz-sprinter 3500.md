The 2010 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 is a popular choice for businesses and individuals needing a reliable and spacious cargo or passenger van. The 2010 model year offers a 3.0L V6 diesel engine that produces 154 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. It was also available with a 3.5L gasoline V6 engine that produces 258 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. People appreciate the Sprinter's high roof, which allows for easy standing inside, its ample cargo capacity, and its diesel engine's fuel efficiency. However, some dislike its relatively high cost, somewhat truck-like handling, and potential for expensive repairs.
