### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 3500 generally offers good reliability for its class, particularly with its robust diesel engines. The most commonly reported technical issues tend to revolve around the emissions control systems (AdBlue, EGR) on the 2.1L engine and turbocharger or glow plug concerns on the 3.0L. The automatic transmission can occasionally suffer from torque converter issues or fluid leaks. Suspension components, specifically leaf springs, may require attention on heavily used vehicles. Electrical gremlins, often related to sensor failures or battery drain, are also noted. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not universally present and often depend on usage and maintenance history. Overall, the Sprinter 3500 remains a dependable workhorse, but owners should be aware of these potential maintenance points.
