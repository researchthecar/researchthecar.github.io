The 7G-Tronic transmission can develop problems with the torque converter and valve body, leading to costly repairs. Suspension issues, especially with the Airmatic system (if equipped), can also be expensive to address. Electrical problems related to the EIS and SAM modules are also possible. While some of these issues may be minor, others can be significant and costly to repair, potentially making the overall ownership experience more expensive than anticipated.
