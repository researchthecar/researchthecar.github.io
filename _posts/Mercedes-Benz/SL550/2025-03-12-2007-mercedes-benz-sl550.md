The SL550 came standard with a 5.5L V8 engine producing 382 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic). While offering a blend of performance and luxury, some owners have reported various issues. Common praises include the powerful V8 engine, refined interior, and the convenience of the hardtop convertible. Complaints often revolve around the cost of maintenance and repairs, particularly with the complex systems like the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension.

**Engine**
