### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz SL550 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 4.7L twin-turbo V8 can experience timing chain tensioner wear and oil leaks, which are costly to repair. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, representing a significant expense. Electrical issues, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and the Keyless Go function, can also arise. The complex retractable hardtop mechanism is another area where actuator or motor failures can occur. While the transmission is generally robust, these other systems require diligent maintenance and potential budget allocation for repairs as the vehicle ages.
