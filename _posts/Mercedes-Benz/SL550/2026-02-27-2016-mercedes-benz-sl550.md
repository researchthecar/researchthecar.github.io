### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz SL550 is a well-engineered luxury convertible with a generally strong reliability record for its powertrain. The primary areas that may require attention are related to the complex Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system, which can be prone to hydraulic leaks and sensor issues, leading to potentially significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. The retractable hardtop mechanism, while sophisticated, can also develop issues with its actuators or motors over time. Despite these potential concerns, the SL550 remains a desirable vehicle for those seeking performance and luxury, provided regular inspections and prompt attention to any developing issues.
