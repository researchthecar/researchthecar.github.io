### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz SL550 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance. While its core powertrain is robust, potential owners should be aware of common issues related to the Active Body Control (ABC) suspension, particularly hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. The retractable hardtop mechanism can also present issues with actuators and seals. Electrical gremlins, especially with sensors and the infotainment system, are not uncommon. Engine-wise, timing chain wear and oil leaks are the primary concerns. Transmission issues, such as TCM failure, can also arise. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners find the SL550 to be a rewarding vehicle, provided regular maintenance and prompt attention to any developing problems.
