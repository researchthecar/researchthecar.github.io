### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Mercedes-Benz ML320 (W163) is a capable luxury SUV, but potential buyers and current owners should be aware of common issues. The 3.2L V6 engine can experience intake manifold leaks and spark plug well issues. The 5-speed automatic transmission is generally robust but can suffer from TCM or conductor plate failures. Suspension components, particularly bushings and the optional Airmatic system, are prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are also reported. Exterior rust and interior headliner sagging are cosmetic concerns to watch for. Despite these potential issues, addressing them proactively can maintain the ML320's comfort and utility.
