### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Mercedes-Benz ML320 is a capable luxury SUV, but it is not without its potential issues. Common problems tend to revolve around the transmission's conductor plate, engine gasket leaks (especially intake manifold), and electrical components like window regulators and the instrument cluster.
