The 2002 Mercedes-Benz ML320 is a mid-size luxury SUV known for its blend of comfort, capability, and Mercedes-Benz prestige. The ML320 comes equipped with a 3.2L V6 engine producing 215 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. The vehicle was also available with a 4.3L V8 and a 5.0L V8 in the ML430 and ML500 respectively. All engine options were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the ML320's smooth ride, solid build quality (when new), and luxurious features. Common complaints revolve around the vehicle's age, leading to increased maintenance costs and potential issues with aging components.

**Summary**

The 2002 Mercedes-Benz ML320, while a comfortable and capable SUV in its time, is now showing its age. The most common issues relate to oil leaks, transmission problems (especially the conductor plate), and suspension wear. Electrical problems such as instrument cluster pixelation and window regulator failure are also fairly common. The severity and cost of these issues can vary greatly depending on the vehicle's condition and maintenance history, with some repairs potentially exceeding $1000. Prospective buyers should have a thorough inspection performed by a qualified mechanic before purchasing, paying close attention to potential leaks, transmission performance, and suspension condition. Air suspension equipped models are more prone to expensive failures than those with standard springs.
