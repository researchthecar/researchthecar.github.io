### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz ML320, particularly with its 3.0L V6 diesel engine, presents a generally reliable package but is not without its potential issues. The most common concerns revolve around the diesel engine's emissions system (DPF, intake manifold flaps) and the sophisticated 7G-Tronic transmission, which can be costly to repair if components like the TCM or torque converter fail. Optional air suspension systems can also be a source of expensive repairs due to leaks. Electrical components like window regulators and headlight modules can also require attention. While many owners report satisfaction, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and factor in potential maintenance costs, especially for higher-mileage examples.
