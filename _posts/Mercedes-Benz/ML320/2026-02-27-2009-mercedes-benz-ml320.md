### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz ML320, particularly the diesel variant, is a capable luxury SUV but is not without its potential mechanical and electrical challenges. The 3.0L V6 turbodiesel engine is prone to issues with the intake manifold runners, EGR system, and turbocharger, which can be costly to repair. Gasoline models with the 3.5L V6 may face balance shaft wear and intake manifold flap problems. Transmission issues, especially with the 7G-TRONIC, can include TCM failures and torque converter problems. Optional air suspension systems are known to develop leaks or compressor failures. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM module, can arise. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in maintenance costs.
