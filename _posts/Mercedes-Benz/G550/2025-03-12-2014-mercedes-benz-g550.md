The 2014 Mercedes-Benz G550 is a luxury SUV known for its iconic boxy design, off-road capabilities, and powerful performance. In 2014, the G550 was equipped with a 5.5-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine producing 382 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Some people admire the G550's ruggedness, luxurious interior, and status symbol, while others dislike its high price tag, poor fuel economy, and somewhat dated driving dynamics compared to modern SUVs. Other engine options in previous years of the G-Wagon have included AMG variants with higher horsepower outputs, but in 2014, the G550 was the standard model offering. The 2014 G550 offered the 7G-Tronic transmission, which is what all information is about below.
