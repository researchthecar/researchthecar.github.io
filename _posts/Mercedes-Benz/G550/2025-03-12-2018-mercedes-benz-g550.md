The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G550 is a luxury SUV known for its iconic boxy design, off-road capabilities, and opulent interior. It's powered by a 4.0L twin-turbo V8 engine producing 416 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. While owners often praise its distinctive style, robust build, and powerful engine, some common complaints revolve around its high price tag, fuel inefficiency, and occasionally, some reliability concerns related to its complex systems.
