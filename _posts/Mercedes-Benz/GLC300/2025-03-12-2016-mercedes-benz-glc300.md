While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix (e.g., loose trim), others can be more significant and costly (e.g., high-pressure fuel pump or air suspension failure). Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision and budget. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
