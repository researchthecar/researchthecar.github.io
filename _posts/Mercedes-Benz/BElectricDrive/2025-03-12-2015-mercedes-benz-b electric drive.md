The 2015 Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive is a fully electric hatchback known for its smooth ride, comfortable interior, and practical cargo space. It boasts a 132 kW (177 hp) electric motor producing 251 lb-ft of torque, providing decent acceleration for its class. Owners generally appreciate the near-silent operation and the elimination of gasoline costs. However, the limited range compared to newer EVs and the dated infotainment system are common criticisms. There are no other engine or transmission options available for this vehicle, as it is solely electric.
