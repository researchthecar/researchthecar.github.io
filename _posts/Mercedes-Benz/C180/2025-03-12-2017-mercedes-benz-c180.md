The 2017 Mercedes-Benz C180 is a popular entry-level luxury sedan known for its elegant styling, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. It offers a blend of practicality and sophistication. The C180 is powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 156 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options available in the C-Class range include more powerful four-cylinder and V6 engines. Owners generally appreciate the C180's refined interior, smooth handling, and fuel economy, but some dislike its somewhat underwhelming performance compared to higher-spec C-Class models and potential maintenance costs associated with owning a luxury vehicle.
