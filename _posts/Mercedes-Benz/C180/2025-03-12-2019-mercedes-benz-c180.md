The 2019 Mercedes-Benz C180 is a popular luxury sedan, known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and advanced technology features. The C180 is equipped with a 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine producing around 156 horsepower and 250 Nm of torque. Other engine options available in the C-Class range include more powerful four-cylinder engines, V6 options, and even AMG variants with significantly higher performance.
