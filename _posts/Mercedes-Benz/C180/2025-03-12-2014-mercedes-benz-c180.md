The 2014 Mercedes-Benz C180 is a popular entry-level luxury sedan known for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and fuel efficiency. The C180 is equipped with a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, producing approximately 156 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options for the 2014 C-Class include the C200 (2.0L turbo four-cylinder) and C250 (2.0L turbo four-cylinder).
