### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS63 AMG is a powerful and generally reliable luxury SUV. The most commonly reported non-wear-and-tear issues tend to be concentrated in the sophisticated AIRMATIC air suspension system, particularly leaks in air springs or compressor failures. The potent 5.5L twin-turbo V8 engine, while robust, can occasionally experience turbocharger issues or intercooler coolant leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as COMAND system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Transmission reliability is good, though the control module can occasionally require attention. Overall, the GLS63 AMG offers a strong reliability record for its class, but owners should be prepared for potentially high repair costs associated with its advanced systems.
