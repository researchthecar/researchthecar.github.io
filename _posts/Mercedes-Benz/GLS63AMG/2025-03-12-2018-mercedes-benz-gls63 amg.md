The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLS63 AMG is a high-performance SUV that blends luxury with potent power. Its main powerplant is a handcrafted 5.5-liter biturbo V8 engine, producing 577 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of torque. The GLS63 AMG is known for its brisk acceleration, comfortable ride (despite its sporty tuning), and luxurious interior appointments. However, some owners have voiced concerns over maintenance costs, fuel economy, and the complexity of its electronic systems. Other GLS models offered different engines, including the GLS450 with a 3.0-liter V6, and the GLS550 with a 4.7-liter V8. All GLS models in 2018 were equipped with a 9-speed automatic transmission.
