The 2009 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale Articulado is a high-capacity articulated bus designed for urban transport. It was primarily available with a Mercedes-Benz OM 457 hLA diesel engine, typically producing around 220 kW (295 hp) and significant torque suited for hauling heavy loads. While appreciated for its passenger capacity and reliability in public transit applications, some owners and operators have reported specific issues. Common likes include its durability and efficiency in high-volume routes, while dislikes often center around maintenance costs and the complexity of its systems.

**Engine**

**Mercedes-Benz OM 457 hLA Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor fuel economy, rough idling, black smoke from the exhaust, difficulty starting. This is often due to wear and tear or contamination of fuel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injectors. Cleaning the fuel system and using high-quality fuel filters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per injector, plus labor.
