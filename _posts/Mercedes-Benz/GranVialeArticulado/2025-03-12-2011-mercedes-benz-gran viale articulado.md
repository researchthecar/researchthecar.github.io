The 2011 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale Articulado is a city bus known for its high capacity and relatively comfortable ride. It typically features a Mercedes-Benz OM 457 LA engine, a 12.0-liter inline-6 diesel, producing around 220 kW (295 hp) and substantial torque. The bus utilizes either a ZF or Voith automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate its reliability and passenger capacity, however, they may find its size challenging to maneuver in tight urban environments. Common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty vehicles, particularly concerning the air conditioning system and suspension components.
