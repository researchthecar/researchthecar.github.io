The 2010 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale Articulado is a low-floor articulated bus popular in urban transit systems. While primarily used in commercial applications, understanding its common issues is important for fleet managers and operators. Engine options typically include diesel variants like the Mercedes-Benz OM926LA, a 7.2-liter inline-6 diesel engine producing around 326 horsepower and 950 lb-ft of torque. The Gran Viale Articulado is appreciated for its high passenger capacity, accessibility features, and durability. However, issues can arise related to its complex systems and heavy-duty usage. Dislikes often center around maintenance costs and the challenges of operating such a large vehicle in dense urban environments.
