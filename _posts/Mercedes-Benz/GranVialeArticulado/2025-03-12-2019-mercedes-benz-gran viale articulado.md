Here's the information regarding common issues and complaints for the 2019 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale Articulado, formatted as requested.

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale Articulado is a specialized bus, not typically sold to individual consumers. As such, information on specific owner complaints is scarce and difficult to verify. The Gran Viale Articulado is generally powered by a diesel engine, often a Mercedes-Benz OM470 or OM936 series, paired with an automatic transmission (likely a ZF or Allison). Power output varies based on the specific engine and configuration but falls in the range of 300-400 horsepower and 900-1250 lb-ft of torque. Due to its commercial nature, user reviews focus on reliability, fuel efficiency, and passenger comfort rather than typical consumer vehicle aspects like styling or infotainment. Common dislikes often relate to maintenance costs and the complexity of the vehicle's systems.

**Engine**

**Mercedes-Benz OM470 Diesel**

* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, black smoke from exhaust, engine misfires, fault codes related to injector performance.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty injector(s). Recoding of the injector(s) to the engine control unit (ECU) might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per injector (depending on labor and location)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, increased turbo lag, whistling noises from the engine, black smoke, potential oil leaks from the turbocharger.
    * Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Check and clean or replace the oil feed and drain lines. Inspect the intercooler for damage or blockage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Mercedes-Benz OM936 Diesel**

* **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, black smoke, increased fuel consumption, engine warning light. Often caused by carbon buildup.
    * Solution: Replace the EGR valve. Clean the EGR cooler. Inspect and clean related hoses and pipes.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**ZF Automatic Transmission (Specific Model Unspecified)**

* **Shifting Problems/Slippage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Delayed or harsh shifting, slippage between gears, difficulty engaging gears, transmission warning light.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission service (fluid and filter change). Inspect the valve body for wear or damage and replace if necessary. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (service) - $6000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Allison Automatic Transmission (Specific Model Unspecified)**

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, loss of power, overheating transmission, unusual noises from the transmission area.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter. Flush the transmission cooler lines. Check the transmission fluid level and condition.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Component Failure (Air Bags, Compressors)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Uneven ride height, sagging on one side, failure to maintain ride height, loud compressor noises, suspension warning lights.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty air spring(s) or air suspension compressor. Check for leaks in the air lines and fittings. Calibrate the air suspension system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3000+ per component (depending on complexity and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Multiplex Wiring Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems affecting various systems (lighting, door controls, HVAC), communication errors between control units, parasitic battery drain.
    * Solution: Diagnose the wiring harness for shorts, opens, or corrosion. Repair or replace damaged wiring or connectors. Update software for affected control units.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ (depending on the complexity and location of the issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures (ABS, Wheel Speed, etc.)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard (ABS, ESP, etc.), erratic system behavior, fault codes stored in the ECU.
    * Solution: Identify the faulty sensor and replace it. Check the wiring and connectors associated with the sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Door Mechanism Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Doors not opening or closing properly, difficulty latching, air leaks around the doors.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the door latch mechanism, hinges, or seals. Adjust door alignment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inadequate heating or cooling, uneven temperature distribution, blower motor failures, strange odors.
    * Solution: Diagnose the HVAC system for refrigerant leaks, faulty actuators, or a blocked evaporator core. Repair or replace the affected components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Gran Viale Articulado, being a heavy-duty commercial vehicle, faces reliability challenges common to buses. Issues range from engine and transmission problems to suspension and electrical faults. Repair costs can be significant, particularly for engine and transmission work. The severity of these issues can be moderate to severe, potentially leading to vehicle downtime and increased operating expenses. Regular maintenance and adherence to service schedules are essential to mitigate these risks.
