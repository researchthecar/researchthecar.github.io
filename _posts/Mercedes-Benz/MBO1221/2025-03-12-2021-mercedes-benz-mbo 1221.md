The 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W205) offered a blend of luxury and performance, continuing the tradition of the model line. The C300 was a popular choice, featuring a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 255 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options included the AMG variants with more powerful engines. The C300 was generally well-received for its comfortable ride, elegant interior, and user-friendly technology. Some common complaints included the somewhat firm ride on rough roads, the complicated infotainment system, and certain reliability concerns. All C300s came with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission.
