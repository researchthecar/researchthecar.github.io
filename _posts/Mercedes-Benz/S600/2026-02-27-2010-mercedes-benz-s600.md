### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Mercedes-Benz S600, while a marvel of engineering, presents a mixed reliability profile. Its V12 engine and sophisticated ABC suspension system are areas where owners are most likely to encounter significant repair costs. Issues with ignition coils, turbochargers, and hydraulic leaks in the ABC system are not uncommon and can be expensive to rectify. The transmission, while generally robust, can suffer from TCM or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, particularly within the infotainment and lighting systems, also warrant attention. Despite these potential drawbacks, the S600 offers an unparalleled luxury experience, but prospective buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair expenditures, especially as the vehicle ages.
