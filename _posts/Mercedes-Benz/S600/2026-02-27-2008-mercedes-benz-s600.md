### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz S600 is a pinnacle of automotive luxury and engineering, but its complexity translates to potential reliability concerns, especially as it ages. The V12 engine, while powerful, can be prone to ignition and cooling system issues. The advanced Active Body Control suspension is a common source of expensive hydraulic leaks and component failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with window regulators and various sensors, are also noted. Transmission issues, though less frequent, can be costly to resolve. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, the sophisticated systems require diligent maintenance and can lead to significant repair bills. Prospective buyers should budget for potential maintenance and repairs.
