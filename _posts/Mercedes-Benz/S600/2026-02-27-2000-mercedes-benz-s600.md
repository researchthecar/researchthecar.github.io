### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Mercedes-Benz S600 is a complex luxury vehicle where reliability is highly dependent on its sophisticated V12 engine and advanced electronic and hydraulic systems. Common issues tend to be concentrated in areas like the Active Suspension System (ABC) with potential hydraulic leaks and pump failures, and the 5-speed automatic transmission's control modules and conductor plates. Electrical gremlins, often related to Body Control Modules and window regulators, are also noted. While the core engine is robust, ignition coils and oil/coolant leaks can arise. Owners should budget for potentially costly repairs, especially for the ABC system and electronics, and prioritize regular, specialized maintenance to mitigate these risks.
