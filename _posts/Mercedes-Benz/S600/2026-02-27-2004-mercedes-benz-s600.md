### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Mercedes-Benz S600 is a pinnacle of automotive luxury and engineering, but its complexity translates to potential reliability concerns, especially as the vehicle ages. The V12 bi-turbo engine, while powerful, can be costly to maintain, with ignition coils, intercooler systems, and turbochargers being common areas for concern. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which are expensive to repair. Electrical gremlins, particularly within the COMAND infotainment system and keyless entry, are also noted. Transmission issues, though less frequent, can involve the control module or torque converter. While the exterior and basic interior components are generally robust, the advanced systems require diligent maintenance and can lead to significant repair bills. Prospective buyers should be prepared for higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs.
