### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz S600 is a pinnacle of automotive luxury and engineering, but its complexity translates to potential reliability concerns, especially as it ages. The V12 twin-turbo engine, while powerful, can be prone to ignition coil and turbocharger issues, along with coolant leaks. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system is a common source of expensive hydraulic leaks and pump failures. Electrically, owners may encounter glitches with the infotainment system, keyless entry, and parasitic battery drain. The transmission, while generally robust, can suffer from TCM or torque converter problems. While the exterior and interior are typically well-built, the advanced systems require diligent maintenance and can lead to significant repair costs. Prospective buyers should factor in the potential for high maintenance and repair expenses.
