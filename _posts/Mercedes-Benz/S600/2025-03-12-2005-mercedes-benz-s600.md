    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Delayed or harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+ (including transmission removal and reinstallation)

**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz S600, while a luxurious and powerful vehicle, is known for its high maintenance costs and potential for expensive repairs. Common issues include coil pack and valve cover gasket failures in the engine, conductor plate problems in the transmission, and ABC system malfunctions in the suspension. Electrical issues with the SAM and EIS units are also frequently reported. Rust can be a problem, especially in areas with harsh winters. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (e.g., individual coil pack replacement) to major (e.g., ABC system overhaul or engine rebuild). The cost to fix these problems can vary widely, from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect any potential purchase and factor in potential maintenance costs.
