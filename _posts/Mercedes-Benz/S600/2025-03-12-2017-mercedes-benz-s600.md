The 2017 Mercedes-Benz S600 represents the pinnacle of luxury and performance within the S-Class lineup. This model year offered a supremely comfortable ride, advanced technology, and handcrafted interiors. While the S-Class generally enjoys a reputation for reliability, certain issues have surfaced among owners. The S600 boasts a 6.0L Bi-Turbo V12 engine producing 523 horsepower and 612 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC PLUS). Other S-Class models offer a range of engines including various V6, V8, and hybrid options, along with 9-speed automatic transmissions in some models. Common owner praises revolve around the opulent interior, smooth ride quality, and powerful engine. Criticisms sometimes focus on the high maintenance costs and complexity of the vehicle's many electronic systems.
