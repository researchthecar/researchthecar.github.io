The 2001 Mercedes-Benz S600 is a flagship luxury sedan known for its powerful V12 engine, opulent interior, and advanced technology for its time. Besides the S600's 5.8L V12, other engine options included a 4.3L V8 in the S430 and a 5.0L V8 in the S500. The V12 engine in the S600 produces 362 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque, providing effortless acceleration. Owners often praise the car's smooth ride, comfortable seats, and quiet cabin. Downsides include high maintenance costs, complex electronics that can be prone to failure, and poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**5.8L V12 (M137)**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, check engine light. Often, one or more of the individual coil packs fail, leading to misfires on specific cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil pack (depending on brand and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks visible on the engine, burning oil smell. The valve cover gaskets on the M137 engine can harden and crack over time, leading to oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (depending on labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, hesitation, stalling, check engine light. The MAF sensor can become dirty or fail, leading to incorrect air-fuel mixture.
    *   Solution: Replace MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (depending on brand and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission stuck in gear, limp mode, check engine light. The conductor plate inside the transmission can develop electrical faults.
    *   Solution: Replace conductor plate.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ (depending on labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping during gear changes, harsh or delayed shifts. This can be caused by worn clutches, low fluid level, or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Transmission flush, valve body repair/replacement, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (flush) - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found
