The 2000 Mercedes-Benz S600 is the top-of-the-line variant of the W220 S-Class, known for its luxurious features and powerful V12 engine. Alongside the S600's 5.8L V12 producing 362 hp and 391 lb-ft of torque, the W220 S-Class also offered various V6 and V8 engine options, along with a diesel option in some markets. Available transmissions were a 5-speed automatic on most models, with the S600 receiving a heavier-duty version. Owners often praise the S600 for its smooth ride, powerful engine, and opulent interior. Common complaints revolve around the high cost of maintenance and repairs, particularly concerning the complex electronics and hydraulics.

**Engine**

**5.8L M137 V12**
*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals. Proper diagnosis is essential to pinpoint the exact source of the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the source of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light caused by faulty ignition coils. The V12 engine has two spark plugs per cylinder, increasing the chance of coil failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coils and spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on how many need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Poor engine performance, hesitation, and a check engine light. The MAF sensor can become contaminated or fail, leading to incorrect air-fuel mixture calculations.
    *   Solution: Replace the MAF sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Transmission Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 722.6 transmission, while generally reliable, can experience slipping or harsh shifting, especially with age and mileage. This can be due to worn friction plates, valve body issues, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In severe cases, a full transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid/filter) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling, or transmission not engaging.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic System Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Airmatic system is prone to leaks and failures, leading to a sagging suspension, warning lights, and a harsh ride. Common failure points include air struts, the air compressor, and valve block.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component that is failing. Replace faulty air struts, the air compressor, or the valve block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per strut, $500 - $1000+ for the compressor, $300 - $800+ for the valve block.
