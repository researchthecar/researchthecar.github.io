### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz S600, while a luxurious and powerful vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical of high-end, complex German sedans. The V12 engine, while potent, can be prone to ignition coil failures and oil leaks. The sophisticated Active Body Control (ABC) suspension system is a notable area for potential costly repairs due to hydraulic leaks. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and parasitic battery drains, are also reported. Transmission issues, such as TCM failure, can also arise. Owners should be prepared for potentially high repair costs, especially for the ABC system and engine-related components, and prioritize regular, specialized maintenance to mitigate these risks.
