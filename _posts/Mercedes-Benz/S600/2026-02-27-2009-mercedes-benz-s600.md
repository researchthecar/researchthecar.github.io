### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz S600, with its complex V12 twin-turbo engine and advanced ABC suspension, offers unparalleled luxury but comes with potential for significant repair costs. Key areas of concern include the engine's ignition coils and turbochargers, the transmission's control module and conductor plate, and the ABC suspension's hydraulic components. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Keyless Go and infotainment systems, are also noted. While the exterior and general interior are relatively robust, the sophisticated systems require diligent maintenance and can be expensive to repair when issues arise. Prospective buyers should factor in the potential for high maintenance and repair expenses.
