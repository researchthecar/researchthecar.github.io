The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Viaggio 1050, produced by Beijing-Benz, a joint venture between Daimler AG and BAIC Motor, is a sedan exclusively for the Chinese market. It is based on the first-generation Mercedes-Benz A-Class platform (W176). Engine options include a 1.4-liter turbocharged engine producing around 150 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine making approximately 188 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners often praise the Viaggio for its comfortable ride, stylish interior, and Mercedes-Benz badge prestige, while criticisms often revolve around its smaller rear passenger space compared to competitors, and occasional concerns about the reliability of the dual-clutch transmission.
