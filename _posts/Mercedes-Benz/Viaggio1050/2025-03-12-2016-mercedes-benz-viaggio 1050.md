The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Metris, known as the Viaggio 1050 in some markets, is a versatile mid-size van aimed at both commercial and personal use. It typically comes with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine producing around 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A diesel engine might be available in some regions. The engine is generally paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Metris for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency compared to larger vans, and cargo capacity. Downsides can include a somewhat basic interior, and some report a firmer ride than expected.
