The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Metris, known as the Viaggio 1050 in some markets, is a versatile mid-size van designed for both commercial and personal use. It's powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC PLUS) is standard. People generally appreciate the Metris/Viaggio for its maneuverability, cargo capacity, and Mercedes-Benz build quality. However, some dislike its relatively basic interior compared to Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and potential for higher maintenance costs.
