The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Viaggio 1050, if we are considering the vehicle I believe you are referring to which is the Fiat Viaggio, was a compact sedan primarily sold in the Chinese market. It was based on the Dodge Dart platform. The sole engine option was a 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, available in two different power outputs (120 hp and 150 hp), and it was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DCT). Owners generally appreciated its comfortable ride and spacious interior, but some criticized its fuel economy and perceived build quality.
