### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its chassis and exterior components. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the diesel exhaust systems (DPF and AdBlue) for both engine options, and potential issues with the glow plug system on the V6 diesel. The automatic transmission is generally robust, though occasional software or fluid-related issues can arise. Electrical components, especially the infotainment screen, may require software updates or resets. While not indicative of widespread failure, these points highlight potential maintenance and repair considerations for owners to be aware of.
