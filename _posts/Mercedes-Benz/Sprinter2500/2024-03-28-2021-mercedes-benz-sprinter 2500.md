## 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 marks the third generation of the German automaker's full-size van series. The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 model offers a cavernous cargo area, advanced safety features, and potent engine options. Its capabilities, however, are not without their shortcomings.

It comes standard with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that delivers 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. The 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V6 generates 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both powertrains are paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission, while rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional.

Owners appreciate the Sprinter 2500's spacious interior, cutting-edge technology, and robust build quality. On the downside, some users cite issues with reliability, high repair costs, and a stiff ride quality.
