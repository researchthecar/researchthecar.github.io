The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 is a versatile van popular for commercial use, camper conversions, and passenger transport. It offers a blend of practicality, capability, and Mercedes-Benz refinement. Engine options for the 2021 Sprinter 2500 include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine producing 188 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L turbocharged diesel V6 producing 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter for its spacious cargo area, comfortable ride (especially with upgraded suspension), and available technology features. Common criticisms include the higher price point compared to competitors and potentially higher maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Four-Cylinder Gasoline Engine**

*   **Crankshaft position sensor failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls intermittently, difficulty starting the engine, check engine light illuminated.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
