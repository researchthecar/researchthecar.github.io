The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 is a versatile van known for its spacious cargo area, customizable configurations, and robust build quality. The standard engine is a 2.1-liter inline-4 diesel producing 161 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. An optional 3.0-liter turbo diesel V6, generating 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, provides increased power. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter's fuel efficiency for its class, payload capacity, and comfortable driving experience. Common criticisms include relatively high maintenance costs and occasional issues with the emissions control systems.

**Summary**

The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500, while appreciated for its functionality, is prone to several issues. Engine problems, particularly with the turbocharger and DPF on the 2.1L diesel and oil cooler leaks on the 3.0L diesel, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter failures, also contribute to high repair bills. Suspension problems like sagging leaf springs are common. Electrical issues, such as glow plug module and wiring harness problems, can also occur. While some repairs are relatively minor, others can be substantial, making thorough inspection and maintenance crucial for prospective buyers.
