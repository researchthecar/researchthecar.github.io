The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 is a versatile van popular for commercial use and camper conversions. In 2012, it was available with two engine options: a 2.1L 4-cylinder diesel engine producing 161 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 diesel engine producing 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder diesel), and comfortable ride. Common complaints include the relatively high cost of maintenance and repairs, and some reliability concerns.
