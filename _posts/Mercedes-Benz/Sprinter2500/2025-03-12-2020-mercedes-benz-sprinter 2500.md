The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 is a versatile van popular for commercial use and camper conversions. The most common engine option is the 3.0L V6 diesel engine, producing 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. Other available engines include a 2.0L 4-cylinder gasoline engine. Both engines are typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission, though earlier models may have had a 5-speed. Owners often praise the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and customizable configurations. Common complaints include the high price point, relatively poor fuel economy (especially for the diesel), and some reliability concerns.
