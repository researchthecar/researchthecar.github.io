The 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 is a versatile van popular for commercial and recreational use. The 2016 Sprinter 2500 offers two engine choices: a 2.1L Turbocharged 4-Cylinder Diesel engine producing 161 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Turbocharged Diesel V6 engine producing 188 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are known for their reliability and fuel efficiency. The 4-cylinder is coupled with a 7-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 gets a 5-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the Sprinter's cargo capacity, customizable configurations, and comfortable ride. However, some common complaints include the van's turning radius, relatively high maintenance costs, and occasional electrical glitches.
