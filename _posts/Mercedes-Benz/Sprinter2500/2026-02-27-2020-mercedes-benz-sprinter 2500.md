### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its core mechanical components like the chassis and standard suspension. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the diesel emissions systems (DPF and AdBlue) for both engine options, and potential electrical gremlins within the infotainment or lighting systems. The V6 diesel, while powerful, has a history of glow plug and turbocharger issues that can be costly to repair. The 4-cylinder diesel is generally more reliable but susceptible to DPF regeneration problems, especially in urban driving cycles. Transmission issues are infrequent but can involve fluid leaks or software glitches. Regular maintenance and mindful driving practices, particularly for emissions systems, are key to maximizing the longevity and reliability of the Sprinter 2500.
