### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 is a workhorse van with a generally solid reputation. The most frequently reported issues tend to revolve around the diesel emissions systems (DPF and AdBlue) for the 2.1L engine, and some specific components like glow plugs and turbochargers for the 3.0L. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter, can also arise. While suspension and electrical components can experience failures, they are less widespread. Owners should be prepared for potential costs associated with emissions system maintenance and repairs, especially if the van is used for frequent short trips that hinder DPF regeneration. Overall, with proper maintenance and attention to these known issues, the Sprinter 2500 can remain a reliable asset for commercial use.
