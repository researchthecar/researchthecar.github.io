### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 demonstrates good overall reliability for a commercial vehicle, with most reported issues stemming from its heavy-duty application or specific diesel engine components. The diesel engines, particularly the 2.1L and 3.0L variants, can experience issues related to emissions systems like the DPF and AdBlue, as well as glow plugs and EGR valves. Transmission issues are less common but can involve leaks or torque converter problems. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are subject to wear given the van's load-carrying nature. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, can occur. Exterior and interior components, while generally durable, may show wear from constant use. Proactive maintenance and addressing warning lights promptly are key to mitigating potential problems and ensuring the longevity of the Sprinter 2500.
