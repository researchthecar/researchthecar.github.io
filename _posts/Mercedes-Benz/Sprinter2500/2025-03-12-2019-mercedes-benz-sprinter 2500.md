The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 is a popular choice for commercial use and camper van conversions, offering a blend of utility and Mercedes-Benz refinement. The standard engine is a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 gasoline engine producing 188 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. An optional 3.0L turbocharged diesel V6 producing 188 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque is also available. Both engines are typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC PLUS). People often praise the Sprinter's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride (for a commercial van), and available technology features. Common complaints include high maintenance costs, some reliability concerns, and the relatively high price point compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**2.0L Turbocharged Inline-4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per injector, depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Turbocharged Diesel V6 Engine**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, DEF level warning light, reduced engine power, or failure to start. Problems can arise from faulty DEF sensors, DEF pumps, or clogged DEF injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the specific component failure, followed by replacement of the faulty sensor, pump, or injector. Cleaning of clogged components might be possible in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+, depending on the specific component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the engine area, noticeable oil consumption, and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the oil cooler and associated seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. Can also manifest as delayed engagement or slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission flush and fluid change might temporarily alleviate the symptoms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ (includes transmission removal and installation).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, difficulty shifting into certain gears, or complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some instances, cleaning and recalibration may resolve the issue, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+ depending on the shop and if the entire valve body is replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a rough ride, particularly when loaded. Cracking or breaking of leaf springs can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs might be recommended for vehicles frequently carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring, depending on the spring type and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights on the dashboard, including ABS, ESP, and TPMS lights. Symptoms depend on the specific sensor that has failed, ranging from inaccurate readings to complete system malfunction.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ per sensor, depending on the location and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting the engine, slow cranking, or complete failure to start. Can be related to a failing battery or parasitic draw on the battery.
    *   Solution: Battery testing to determine its condition, followed by replacement if necessary. Investigation of potential parasitic draws if the battery repeatedly drains.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ for battery replacement. Additional cost for diagnosing and repairing parasitic draws.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Failure (Diesel Only)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, rough idle, excessive smoke upon startup, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty glow plug(s), followed by replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$600
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, sticking or binding, and unusual noises during operation. Problems can arise from worn rollers, damaged tracks, or faulty latch mechanisms.
    *   Solution: Inspection and lubrication of the sliding door mechanism. Replacement of worn rollers, damaged tracks, or faulty latches as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+, depending on the severity of the damage and parts required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Issues**

**Summary**

The 2019 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500, while lauded for its versatility and utility, faces a range of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the diesel V6 (DEF system and oil cooler leaks), and transmission problems (torque converter and valve body) can be costly. Electrical issues, sensor failures, and suspension issues such as rear leaf spring failure can also arise. Sliding door and HVAC problems represent other potential areas of concern. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major and expensive repairs. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common issues and ensure a thorough inspection and maintenance history check before purchasing.
