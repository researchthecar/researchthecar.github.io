### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly for its class. The diesel engines, while powerful and efficient, can be prone to emissions-related issues like DPF problems and AdBlue system faults, especially with inconsistent driving patterns. Transmission issues are less common but can be costly if they arise. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, may require attention due to the van's heavy-duty nature. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drains and sensor failures, are also noted. Owners should be mindful of these potential issues and adhere to recommended maintenance schedules to ensure longevity and optimal performance.
