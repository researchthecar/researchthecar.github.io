The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Metris MBO 1218 is a versatile mid-size van aimed at both commercial and personal use. While predominantly offered with a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 gasoline engine producing around 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, it's often praised for its maneuverability and cargo capacity. Some owners, however, have reported issues with the vehicle's reliability and certain components. The Metris is equipped with a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. People have liked the van because of the compact size, powerful engine, and high MPG. Some people disliked the Metris because of the high price, bland interior, and safety options that cost extra.
