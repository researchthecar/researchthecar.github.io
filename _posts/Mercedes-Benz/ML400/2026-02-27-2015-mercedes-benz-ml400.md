### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz ML400 offers a compelling package of luxury and performance. While its core powertrain and chassis are generally robust, potential owners should be aware of specific issues that can arise. Common concerns include turbocharger problems and oil leaks from valve cover gaskets on the V6 engine, as well as potential failures within the 7-speed automatic transmission's control module or torque converter. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. If the vehicle is equipped with air suspension, leaks are a possibility. Despite these potential issues, many ML400s remain reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
