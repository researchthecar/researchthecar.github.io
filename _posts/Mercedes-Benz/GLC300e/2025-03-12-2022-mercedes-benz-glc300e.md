The 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLC300e is a plug-in hybrid SUV that blends luxury with efficiency. The GLC300e is equipped with a 2.0-liter inline-4 turbo engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 315 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. This powertrain is mated to a 9G-TRONIC 9-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options for the standard GLC300 include a similar 2.0L turbo without the hybrid components in the GLC 300. High performance AMG versions offer more powerful engines and transmissions. Owners often praise the GLC300e for its comfortable ride, upscale interior, and fuel efficiency due to its hybrid capabilities. However, some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the infotainment system, the limited all-electric range, and occasional electrical glitches.
