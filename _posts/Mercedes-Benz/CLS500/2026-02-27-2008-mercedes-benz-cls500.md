### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz CLS500 is a luxurious and powerful vehicle, but its advanced systems can lead to specific reliability concerns as it ages. The 5.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but leaks from oil cooler seals and intake manifold gaskets are common. The 5-speed automatic transmission, while durable, can suffer from TCM or conductor plate issues. The optional AirMatic suspension is a significant point of potential expense, with leaks in struts and compressor failures being prevalent. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and headlight ballasts, are also noted. Interior components like seat controls and HVAC resistors can also require attention. Despite these potential issues, many CLS500s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and prompt repair of known faults.
