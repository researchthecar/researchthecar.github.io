### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz CLS500 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The 5.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but leaks from oil cooler seals and intake manifold gaskets are known. The 5-speed automatic transmission can suffer from TCM or conductor plate failures, leading to shifting problems. Suspension components, particularly air suspension parts if equipped, and control arm bushings can require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators, headlight ballasts, and SAM unit issues, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age. Interior components like sagging headliners and seat heater failures also appear. Despite these potential drawbacks, with diligent maintenance and prompt repair of identified issues, the CLS500 can remain a reliable and enjoyable luxury vehicle.
