The 2013 Mercedes-Benz CLS500 is a stylish and luxurious four-door coupe, praised for its elegant design, comfortable ride, and powerful engine. The CLS500 boasts a 4.7-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 402 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. A 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC PLUS) is the only transmission available for this model.
