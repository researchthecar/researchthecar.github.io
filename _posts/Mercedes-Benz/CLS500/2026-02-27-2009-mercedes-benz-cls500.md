### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz CLS500 offers a compelling blend of luxury and performance, but potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 5.0L V8 engine, while generally robust, can develop leaks from oil cooler seals or intake manifold gaskets. The 5-speed automatic transmission, particularly the 722.6 variant, may experience issues with its control module or conductor plate, leading to shifting problems. The optional AirMatic suspension is a notable area for potential expense, with common failures including air strut leaks and compressor issues. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and headlight ballast failures, can also arise. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, these specific components represent the most common areas requiring attention on this model.
