While praised for its exhilarating performance, luxurious interior, and distinctive AMG styling, owners have reported various issues. Common complaints include high maintenance costs, premature wear of certain components, and issues related to the air suspension system. The ML350 and ML550 were also available, but this document focuses solely on the ML63 AMG.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**
* **Camshaft Adjuster/Camshaft Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, especially on cold starts or at idle. Reduced engine performance, check engine light. Worn camshaft lobes and/or faulty camshaft adjusters (also known as cam phasers) are the cause.
    * Solution: Replacement of camshafts, camshaft adjusters, and associated parts. In some cases, the cylinder head may also need to be inspected and repaired or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Head Bolt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, overheating, milky oil, engine misfires, and white smoke from the exhaust. Can lead to catastrophic engine damage. This is a known issue with early M156 engines (generally pre-2011, with 2007 being particularly vulnerable).
    * Solution: Replacement of all head bolts with updated, stronger bolts. This is a very labor-intensive job.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Intake Manifold Air Flap Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idle, loss of power, poor fuel economy. The intake manifold air flap motor controls the flaps that optimize airflow into the engine.
    * Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold air flap motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000-$1,500
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the engine, burning oil smell, low oil level. Common leak points include valve cover gaskets, oil cooler lines, and front timing cover.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+, depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**
* **Conductor Plate Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, transmission slipping, getting stuck in a gear, "limp mode" (transmission locked in 2nd or 3rd gear), check engine light.
    * Solution: Replacement of the conductor plate (also known as the valve body control unit) inside the transmission.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Delayed or harsh shifting.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Airmatic Air Suspension Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, air compressor running constantly, "Visit Workshop" warning message related to the air suspension, harsh ride.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the Airmatic system. This may involve replacing air struts, air compressor, valve block, or air lines.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ per corner, depending on the component needing replacement. Compressor replacement is generally $800-$1500.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, needing to jump-start the car frequently. Can be caused by a faulty component not shutting down properly.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the battery drain. This may involve testing various modules and components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+, depending on the source of the drain.
    * Recalls: None Found
* **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Key not recognized, difficulty starting the vehicle, no response from the ignition when the key is inserted.
    * Solution: Replacement of the EIS module. This requires programming by a qualified technician.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Multiple electrical issues, such as malfunctioning lights, wipers, or other electrical accessories. SAM modules control various electrical functions in the vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG offers impressive performance but is known for potential issues, particularly with its engine, transmission, and air suspension. The M156 engine is notorious for head bolt and camshaft adjuster issues which can be very expensive to repair. Air suspension failures are also common and can lead to significant repair bills. While other issues exist, these are the most prevalent and costly to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering this vehicle. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified Mercedes-Benz mechanic are highly recommended.
