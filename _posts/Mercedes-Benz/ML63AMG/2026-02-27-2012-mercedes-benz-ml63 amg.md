### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG offers a compelling blend of performance and luxury, but its high-performance nature means potential owners should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The 5.5L twin-turbo V8, while powerful, can experience issues with wastegate actuators, intake manifold runners, and the PCV system. The AMG SPEEDSHIFT transmission is generally robust but can develop torque converter seal leaks or TCM problems. The AIRMATIC suspension, a common feature, is prone to air spring bladder or compressor failures, and the optional Active Curve System can be costly to repair if hydraulic components fail. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parking sensors, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally well-built, these mechanical and electrical components represent the primary areas where owners might face significant repair costs beyond standard maintenance.
