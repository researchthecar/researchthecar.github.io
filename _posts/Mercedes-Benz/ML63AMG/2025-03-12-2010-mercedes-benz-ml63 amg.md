While the ML63 AMG delivers impressive power and luxurious features, it also has some common issues owners have reported. Owners often appreciate the vehicle's powerful engine and aggressive styling, but common complaints revolve around high running costs, especially fuel consumption and maintenance. Only one engine and transmission option was available.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (also known as camshaft housing bolts) are known to be weak and prone to failure. Symptoms include a ticking noise, misfires, and eventually engine damage if left unaddressed. This can also lead to metal debris circulating within the engine. The bolts are prone to shearing off.
    *   Solution: Replace the original camshaft adjuster bolts with updated, stronger bolts. It is recommended to replace all bolts preemptively. Cleaning the engine of any debris is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on damage and if engine needs to be pulled.

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold on the M156 engine is made of plastic and can crack or warp over time. Symptoms include rough idling, loss of power, and a check engine light. Leaks can cause vacuum issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold with a new one, using updated gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

*   **Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The M156 engine can be prone to oil consumption, especially as mileage increases. This is often attributed to worn valve stem seals and piston rings.
    * Solution: Replacing valve stem seals or piston rings, or ultimately rebuilding the engine.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9) 7-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 722.9 transmission's valve body is prone to wear and failure. Symptoms include rough or delayed shifting, slipping gears, and transmission malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. A conductor plate replacement is often recommended simultaneously.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, stalling, and poor acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ML63 AMG utilizes an Airmatic suspension system that is prone to leaks and compressor failures. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting low, a non-functional suspension, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking air struts or the air compressor. Diagnose the system to pinpoint the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut; $600 - $1,500+ for compressor.

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can be a common issue, often related to the electronic control units (ECUs) not properly shutting down or a faulty component drawing power when the vehicle is off.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and isolate the source of the drain. This may involve testing individual circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the source.

*   **EIS/ESL Failure**
