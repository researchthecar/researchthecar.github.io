### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG is a powerful and luxurious SUV, but its performance-oriented nature and complex systems can lead to specific reliability concerns. The M156 engine, while potent, is known for potential camshaft wear and oil/coolant leaks, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission may exhibit shifting issues or torque converter problems. The optional AIRMATIC suspension is prone to air spring leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly with sensors and the infotainment system, are also reported. While the standard suspension, exterior, and interior are generally robust, potential buyers should be prepared for higher maintenance and repair costs associated with the performance components.
