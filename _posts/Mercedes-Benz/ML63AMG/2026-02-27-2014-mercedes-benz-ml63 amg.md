### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG is a powerful and luxurious SUV, but its performance comes with potential reliability considerations. The twin-turbo V8 engine, while potent, can experience issues with wastegate actuators and the PCV system. The AMG Speedshift transmission may encounter problems with the torque converter or TCM. The sophisticated Active Body Control suspension is a common source of expensive hydraulic leaks and pump failures.
