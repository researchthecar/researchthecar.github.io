The 2018 Mercedes-Benz C350e is a plug-in hybrid variant of the popular C-Class sedan. It combines a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 engine (208 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque) with an electric motor (80 hp). This powertrain delivers a combined output of 275 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 7G-TRONIC PLUS 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the C350e for its fuel efficiency, smooth ride, and luxurious interior. Some common complaints include the limited electric range, the smaller trunk space due to the battery pack, and the complexity of the hybrid system, which can lead to some reliability concerns.

**Electric Motor**

* **Electric Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The vehicle displays a "Check Engine" light or a specific error code related to the electric motor. The car may experience a loss of power, reduced electric range, or inability to switch to electric-only mode.
    * Solution: Replacement of the electric motor. This involves disconnecting the high-voltage battery, removing the old motor, and installing the new one.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+

**Battery Pack**

* **Reduced Battery Capacity/Range**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable decrease in the electric driving range. The battery may not fully charge, or it discharges rapidly.
    * Solution: In some cases, a software update can improve battery management. If the degradation is severe, battery pack replacement is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $15,000+ (Battery replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Management System (BMS) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The BMS controls charging and discharging. Failure can cause charging problems, error messages, and potential damage to the battery pack.
    * Solution: Replacement of the BMS module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**7G-TRONIC PLUS Transmission**

**Summary**

The 2018 Mercedes-Benz C350e, while offering a blend of luxury and efficiency, can present owners with several potential issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the COMAND system and various sensors, are relatively common and can be moderately expensive to repair. The hybrid system components, such as the electric motor and battery pack, can be costly to replace. Suspension issues, specifically with the air suspension (if equipped), can also lead to significant repair bills. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision. Regular maintenance and careful inspection can help mitigate some of these risks.
