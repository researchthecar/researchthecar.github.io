**Summary**

The 2005 Mercedes-Benz C230 can be a fun and stylish vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of its common issues. Engine and transmission problems, especially conductor plate and timing chain related issues, can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins and suspension wear are also prevalent. Rust can be a significant concern, particularly in areas with harsh weather conditions. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can quickly escalate into significant expenses, potentially exceeding several thousand dollars. Thorough inspection of these areas is recommended before purchase.
