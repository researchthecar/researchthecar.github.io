**Introduction**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz C230 is a luxury sedan powered by a 2.5L V6 engine that produces 201 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. It is available with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. The C230 is known for its refined ride, comfortable interior, and strong performance, but it also has a few common issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

* **2.5L V6 Engine**

   * **Intake Manifold Runner Control Failure:** The intake manifold runner control valve can fail, causing the engine to run rough and lose power. The solution is to replace the valve, which costs around $200 - $300+.
   * **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure:** The crankshaft position sensor can fail, causing the engine to stall or fail to start. The sensor costs around $100 - $150+, and labor to replace it is around $100 - $200+.

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

   * **Slipping or Hesitation:** The transmission may slip or hesitate when shifting gears. This can be caused by worn clutch packs or a faulty valve body. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission, which costs around $2,000 - $3,000+.

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Noise:** The front suspension can make a clunking or rattling noise when driving over bumps. This is typically caused by worn strut mounts or control arms. Replacing the worn components costs around $500 - $800+.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely, especially if the car is not driven regularly. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from the electrical system, such as a faulty alternator or a light that stays on when the car is turned off. The solution is to find and fix the source of the draw, which can cost anywhere from $100 - $500+.

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** The headlights can develop condensation inside the lens, especially after washing the car. This is a cosmetic issue that can be fixed by replacing the headlight assembly, which costs around $500 - $800+ per headlight.

**Interior**

* **Navigation System Malfunction:** The navigation system may malfunction, causing it to freeze or give incorrect directions. The solution is to update the software or replace the navigation unit, which costs around $500 - $1,000+.
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may malfunction, causing it to blow warm or cold air when it is set to a different temperature. This can be caused by a faulty blend door actuator or a failed control module. Replacing the actuator costs around $200 - $300+, while replacing the control module costs around $500 - $800+.

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz C230 is a reliable and enjoyable car, but it does have a few common issues that owners should be aware of. The most serious and expensive issue is the transmission slipping or hesitation. The other issues are generally less severe and less expensive to fix. Overall, the C230 is a good choice for drivers who want a luxury sedan with a comfortable ride and strong performance.
