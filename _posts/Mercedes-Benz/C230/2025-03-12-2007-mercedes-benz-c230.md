**Summary:**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz C230, while offering a luxurious experience, is prone to certain issues, particularly with its engine, transmission, electrical systems, and suspension. Oil leaks and camshaft sensor failures are common engine problems. The 7-speed automatic transmission can experience rough shifting. Electrical issues, particularly related to the EIS and SAM units, can be costly to address. Suspension wear, specifically control arm bushings, is also a common issue. Rust can develop on the exterior. Overall, owners should be prepared for potential maintenance and repair costs associated with a vehicle of this age and complexity.
