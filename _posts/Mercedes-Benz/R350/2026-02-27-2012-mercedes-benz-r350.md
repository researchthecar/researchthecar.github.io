### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Mercedes-Benz R350 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components are generally robust, specific issues like intake manifold runner flap failures and timing chain wear on the 3.5L V6 engine require attention. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can experience torque converter and valve body problems. Owners with the optional air suspension should be aware of potential leaks and compressor failures. Electrical gremlins, particularly CAN bus communication errors, can be complex to diagnose. Interior electronics, such as the COMAND system and climate control actuators, are also noted areas for potential repair. Despite these potential issues, many R350s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and prompt repair of identified problems.
