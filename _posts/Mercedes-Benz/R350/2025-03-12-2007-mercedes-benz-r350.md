The 2007 Mercedes-Benz R350 is a luxury wagon that aimed to blend the comfort of a sedan with the versatility of an SUV. The most common engine available was a 3.5L V6 engine producing around 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and luxurious features. However, common complaints often revolve around reliability issues and higher maintenance costs. Other engine options available in certain markets included diesel and larger gasoline V8s. All engine options were typically paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-Tronic).

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, check engine light illuminated. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to camshaft position may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on location and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Balance Shaft Gear Wear (M272 Engine - Early Production)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine noise, rough running, check engine light. This is a known issue with earlier M272 engines.
    *   Solution: Replacing the balance shaft. This is a major engine repair requiring significant disassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ as it is labor-intensive.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Flap Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idle, loss of power, poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacing the intake manifold.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, getting stuck in gear, transmission slipping, check engine light. Diagnostic trouble codes related to transmission control unit (TCU) faults may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the conductor plate (also known as the valve body plate) inside the transmission. This usually requires draining the transmission fluid, removing the valve body, replacing the conductor plate, and reprogramming the TCU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Can also present as harsh shifting or slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on whether the transmission needs to be removed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or more corners, ride height issues, "Visit Workshop" message related to the suspension system. Compressor may run constantly or fail.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty air struts, air compressor, or air lines. Leaks in the system are common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air struts can range from $500-$1500+ per strut. Compressor replacement is usually in the $500-$1000+ range. Air line repairs vary depending on the leak location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Car battery dying frequently, especially after sitting for a few days. Can be due to a parasitic drain.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the source of the parasitic drain. This can involve testing various electrical components to identify the culprit. Common causes include faulty door modules, seat control modules, or the COMAND system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **COMAND System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Radio not working, navigation issues, screen freezing or going blank, Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting the COMAND system, which may involve software updates, replacing faulty components (like the head unit), or repairing wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the issue and whether a new or refurbished unit is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues (Especially in areas with road salt)**

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz R350, while offering a blend of luxury and practicality, is prone to several common issues. The most concerning are the potential engine problems (balance shaft gear wear) and transmission issues (conductor plate/torque converter failure), which can be quite expensive to repair. Electrical problems and air suspension issues (if equipped) can also contribute to higher ownership costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into the overall cost of ownership, budgeting for potential repairs.
