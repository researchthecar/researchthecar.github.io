The 2009 Mercedes-Benz R350 is a luxury crossover wagon that offered a blend of passenger space, cargo capacity, and a refined driving experience. It came with either a 3.5L V6 engine producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque or a 3.0L turbodiesel V6 engine. Both engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. People often praised the R350 for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available all-wheel drive. Criticisms often revolved around its bulky styling, higher maintenance costs compared to non-luxury vehicles, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz R350, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, does have some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine issues like balance shaft sprocket wear (on the 3.5L V6) and oil cooler leaks (on the diesel) can be expensive to repair. Transmission problems, particularly conductor plate and valve body issues, are also relatively common and costly. The air suspension (if equipped) is another potential source of expensive repairs. Electrical issues, such as EIS or SAM module failure, can also arise. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, making a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic highly recommended.
