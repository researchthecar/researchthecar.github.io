The 3.5L V6 engine has known issues with intake manifold flaps and balance shaft gears, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can also develop problems with its valve body and torque converter. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SAM module, are not uncommon. While the suspension and exterior are generally robust, air suspension systems (if equipped) can be a source of expense. Interior electronics, such as the COMAND system, may experience occasional glitches. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of maintenance and potential repairs, especially for higher-mileage examples.
