The 2013 Mercedes-Benz R350 is a luxury crossover wagon that offers a unique blend of passenger space and cargo capacity. The R350 came standard with a 3.5L V6 engine producing 302 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. While owners generally appreciate the R350's comfortable ride and luxurious interior, some common complaints include electrical issues, suspension problems, and certain engine-related concerns.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (M276)**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, potential engine misfires. The camshaft adjuster solenoid, responsible for controlling oil flow to the camshaft adjusters, can fail, leading to improper camshaft timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty camshaft adjuster solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure/Timing Chain Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially in colder temperatures. In severe cases, potential engine damage. The timing chain tensioner may fail, or the timing chain may stretch over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioner, and potentially other related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Runner Flap Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, decreased engine performance, potential rough idling. The intake manifold runner flaps, which control airflow into the engine, may fail or become stuck.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, transmission getting stuck in gear. The valve body, responsible for controlling hydraulic pressure within the transmission, may experience wear or failure of internal components.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or shaking during acceleration, abnormal transmission noises. The torque converter may experience internal damage, leading to inefficient power transfer.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging of the vehicle, uneven ride height, failure to maintain ride height, compressor failure. The airmatic suspension system uses air springs to provide a comfortable ride, but these components can leak or fail over time.
    *   Solution: Replacement of air springs, air compressor, or associated valves/sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per air spring; $500-$1500+ for compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Air Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, especially overnight. The rear air springs are known to leak over time, particularly the seals and the bladder itself.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600-$1500+ for both rear air springs
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, needing frequent jump starts. The R350 can experience parasitic battery drain due to faulty modules or wiring.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the underlying electrical fault. This might involve replacing a module or repairing wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical malfunctions, including lighting issues, wiper problems, and inability to start the vehicle. The SAM modules control various electrical functions and can fail due to water intrusion or electrical surges.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reprogramming of the faulty SAM module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof not opening or closing properly, unusual noises, water leaks. The sunroof mechanism can become misaligned, and the seals can deteriorate.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof mechanism or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Navigation/Infotainment System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, unresponsive screen, system reboots, lack of GPS functionality. The navigation and infotainment system can experience software glitches or hardware failures.
    *   Solution: Software update, replacement of the head unit, or repair of the navigation module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Mercedes-Benz R350, while offering a luxurious and comfortable ride, is prone to certain issues. Engine-related problems, particularly those involving the camshaft adjusters and timing chain, can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can also experience issues, especially with the valve body and torque converter. If equipped with air suspension, that system is a common source of problems. Electrical issues, such as battery drain and SAM module failure, are also relatively prevalent. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering the purchase of a used 2013 Mercedes-Benz R350. While some issues may be relatively minor, others can be significant and expensive to address, especially the airmatic suspension.
