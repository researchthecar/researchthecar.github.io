### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Mercedes-Benz R350 exhibits a mixed reliability record. The most significant concerns revolve around the M272 engine's balance shaft and intake manifold issues, as well as potential problems with the 722.6 transmission's control module and torque converter. Optional air suspension systems can also be a source of costly repairs. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, electrical components like window regulators and headlight ballasts have been reported to fail. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potentially higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs, especially if purchasing a vehicle with higher mileage or without a comprehensive service history.
