**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Balance Shaft Sprocket Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the balance shaft sprocket can occur. Symptoms include a check engine light with codes related to camshaft timing or correlation (typically P0016, P0017, P0018, P0019), engine noise (rattling or ticking), and potentially rough running.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the balance shaft and potentially the timing chain, tensioner, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Cam Magnet) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the camshaft adjuster solenoids (also known as cam magnets) can occur. Oil can wick into the engine wiring harness, potentially causing further electrical issues. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, oil smell, and potentially misfires or other engine performance problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking camshaft adjuster solenoid and cleaning or replacement of the affected wiring harness sections. A revised camshaft adjuster solenoid (part number A2710510177) is available to prevent wicking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gaskets. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low engine oil level.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic 722.9 7-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 722.9 transmission's valve body can experience wear and tear on its internal components (solenoids, valves, and springs), leading to shifting problems. Symptoms include hard or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, slipping, and being stuck in gear.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. In some cases, individual solenoids can be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission conductor plate (also known as the electrohydraulic control unit) houses the transmission control module (TCM) and various sensors. Failure of the conductor plate can cause various shifting problems, including being stuck in gear, erratic shifting, and a complete loss of transmission function.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the conductor plate and reprogramming of the TCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If equipped with Airmatic air suspension, common issues include air leaks in the air struts/springs, compressor failure, and valve block issues. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting low on one or more corners, the suspension not leveling correctly, a noisy or non-functioning compressor, and "Suspension Malfunction" warnings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaking air struts/springs, replacement of the air compressor, and/or replacement of the valve block.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut/spring; $500 - $1,200+ for compressor replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the EIS can prevent the vehicle from starting or cause intermittent starting problems. The key may not be recognized, or the steering wheel may not unlock.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EIS and potentially reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SAM controls various electrical functions, and failure can cause a wide range of issues, including lighting problems, wiper malfunctions, and other electrical gremlins.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty SAM unit and reprogramming.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Tail Light Assembly Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the plastic lens on the rear tail light assemblies. This can allow moisture to enter, damaging the bulbs and electrical components.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the tail light assembly.

**Summary**

The 2010 Mercedes-Benz R350, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, can be prone to various issues that can result in significant repair costs. Engine-related problems like balance shaft wear and oil leaks can be expensive to address. Transmission issues, particularly valve body and conductor plate failures, are also common concerns. Air suspension problems, if equipped, can further add to the ownership costs. Electrical issues relating to the EIS and SAM modules can also arise. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor them into their purchasing decision and budget for potential repairs.
