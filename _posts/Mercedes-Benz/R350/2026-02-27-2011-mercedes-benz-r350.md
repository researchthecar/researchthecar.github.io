### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Mercedes-Benz R350 presents a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its standard coil spring suspension and interior components. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with the gasoline V6 engine, specifically the intake manifold runner flap actuator and balance shaft wear, which can be costly to repair. For diesel models, DPF and AdBlue system maintenance are key considerations. The 7-speed automatic transmission can experience valve body or torque converter problems. Optional air suspension systems, while offering comfort, are prone to leaks and compressor failures. Addressing these potential issues proactively through diligent maintenance and prompt repairs can help ensure a positive ownership experience.
