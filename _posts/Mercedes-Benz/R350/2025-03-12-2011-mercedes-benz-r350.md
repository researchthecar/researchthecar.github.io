The 2011 Mercedes-Benz R350 is a luxury minivan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available all-wheel drive. The R350 offered two engine options: a 3.5L V6 producing 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L diesel V6 producing 210 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the R350 for its practicality and car-like handling, while some criticized its styling and perceived lack of prestige compared to SUVs.
