### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz R350 is a comfortable and capable luxury crossover, but potential buyers should be aware of specific reliability concerns. The M272 V6 engine is prone to issues with the intake manifold runner flaps and balance shaft/timing chain wear, which can be costly to repair. The 7G-TRONIC transmission can experience problems with its control module and torque converter. While the suspension and electrical systems are generally robust, air suspension components (if equipped) can develop leaks, and window regulators are a common failure point. Exterior and interior components tend to be reliable, with no widespread issues reported. Proactive maintenance and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended.
