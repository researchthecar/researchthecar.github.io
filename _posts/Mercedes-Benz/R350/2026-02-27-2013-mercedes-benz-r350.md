### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz R350 presents a mixed reliability profile. The powertrain, particularly the 3.5L V6 engine and 7G-TRONIC transmission, has documented issues such as intake manifold runner flap failure, timing chain wear, valve body malfunctions, and torque converter problems, which can be costly to repair. Suspension components, especially if equipped with air suspension, can also develop leaks. Electrical gremlins like window regulator failures and sensor issues are not uncommon. However, the exterior and interior generally hold up well with no widespread critical failures reported. Owners should be prepared for potential maintenance costs related to the engine and transmission, while other areas tend to be more robust.
