# 2016 Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG

### Overview
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG, a high-performance variant of the iconic G-Class, is renowned for its extreme power and luxury. However, its complex engineering and high-output twin-turbo V12 engine can present unique reliability considerations. While the G65 AMG is built with robust materials, its specialized nature means that certain components, particularly those related to its potent powertrain and advanced systems, may require more attentive maintenance and can be prone to specific, albeit often costly, issues. Owners should be aware of potential challenges in areas like the engine and electrical systems, which are more likely to experience non-routine problems compared to more mainstream vehicles. Despite these potential concerns, the G65 AMG remains a desirable vehicle for its exclusivity and performance.

### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG, while a marvel of engineering, demands significant attention to its specialized components. The 6.0L V12 engine, with its twin-turbochargers, is the primary area where owners may encounter costly repairs, including turbocharger failures and ignition coil issues. The transmission, while generally robust, can experience problems with its control module or torque converter. Suspension components, particularly the adaptive damping system and any air suspension elements, are also potential sources of expense. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment system and various sensors, can also arise. The exterior and interior generally hold up well, but the powertrain and associated systems are where reliability concerns are most concentrated. Regular, expert maintenance is crucial for mitigating these risks.
