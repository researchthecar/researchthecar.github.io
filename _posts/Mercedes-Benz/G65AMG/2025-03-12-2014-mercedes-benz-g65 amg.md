The 2014 Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG is a high-performance SUV known for its powerful engine and luxurious features, but also for its rugged, boxy design. While it offers impressive off-road capabilities and a prestigious image, it also faces criticism for its high running costs and limited fuel efficiency. The G65 AMG is equipped with a 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 603 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. The G-Wagen also came with a 5.5L Twin Turbo V8 engine rated at 536 Horsepower and 560 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L Turbo Diesel V6. All engine options are paired with a 7G-Tronic automatic transmission. Common owner dislikes include the fuel economy, and the high cost of maintenance.
