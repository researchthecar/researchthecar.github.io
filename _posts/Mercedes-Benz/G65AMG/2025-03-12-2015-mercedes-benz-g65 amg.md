The 2015 Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG is a high-performance, ultra-luxury SUV known for its iconic boxy design, powerful engine, and exceptional off-road capabilities. Beyond the G65, the 2015 G-Class also offered the G550 with a 4.0L V8 engine. However, the G65 AMG boasts a handcrafted 6.0L twin-turbo V12 engine, producing a staggering 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. The G65 AMG is exclusively paired with a 7G-TRONIC seven-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its unique blend of luxury, performance, and ruggedness. Conversely, common criticisms include its high price tag, poor fuel economy, and somewhat dated interior compared to other luxury SUVs.
