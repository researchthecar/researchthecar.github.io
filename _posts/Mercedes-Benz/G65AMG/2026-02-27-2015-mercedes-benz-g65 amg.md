### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG is a highly specialized and powerful vehicle. While its core mechanical components are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with the twin-turbo V12 engine's turbochargers and cooling system, as well as the automatic transmission's control module and torque converter. The adaptive damping system in the suspension can also be a source of repair costs. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are not uncommon in high-end vehicles of this era. Despite these potential concerns, the G65 AMG remains a desirable and capable machine, with most issues being repairable, albeit at a premium cost reflective of its luxury and performance status.
