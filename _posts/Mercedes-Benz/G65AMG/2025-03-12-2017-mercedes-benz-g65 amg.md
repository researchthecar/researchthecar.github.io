The 2017 Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG is a high-performance SUV known for its luxurious features, rugged off-road capabilities, and powerful engine. In 2017, the G-Class was available with other engine options like the G550 with a 4.0L V8 biturbo engine producing 416 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque, and the G63 AMG with a 5.5L V8 biturbo engine producing 563 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of torque. The G65 AMG, however, boasts a handcrafted 6.0L V12 biturbo engine delivering 621 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. It's paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the G65's distinctive styling, powerful engine, and luxurious interior. Common complaints revolve around its high price, poor fuel economy, and somewhat dated driving dynamics compared to more modern SUVs.

**Engine**

**6.0L V12 Biturbo (M279)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a fairly common issue on the M279 V12 engine. These leaks can originate from various locations including the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or turbocharger lines. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves locating the source of the leak, followed by replacement of the affected gasket or seal. For turbocharger line leaks, the lines themselves may need replacing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the leak location and extent of the work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The V12 engine uses individual coil packs for each cylinder. These coil packs can fail over time due to heat and age. Symptoms include misfires, rough idling, decreased power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) will indicate which cylinder is misfiring.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack. It's often recommended to replace all coil packs at the same time to avoid future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per coil pack, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The G65 AMG's V12 engine utilizes two turbochargers. Issues can include wastegate actuator failure, oil leaks within the turbocharger, or even complete turbocharger failure. Symptoms include a loss of power, whistling or screeching noises from the engine bay, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis confirms the turbocharger issue, followed by repair or replacement of the affected unit. Wastegate actuators can sometimes be replaced separately, while a complete turbo failure necessitates turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ per turbocharger, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 722.9 transmission, while generally reliable, can experience valve body issues. These can manifest as harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or a complete failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body or solenoids is typically the solution. Sometimes, a software update can address minor issues, but physical replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+, including labor and parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The G65 AMG utilizes an air suspension system for a smooth ride and adjustable ride height. Common issues include leaks in the air struts, compressor failure, or problems with the air suspension control module. Symptoms include a sagging vehicle (especially overnight), a constantly running air compressor, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the leak or faulty component. Air struts can be replaced individually or in pairs. Compressor replacement is also common. In some cases, the air suspension control module may need to be reprogrammed or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per strut, $800-$1500 for compressor, $500-$1500 for control module replacement (all including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the complexity of the vehicle, various sensors throughout the car can malfunction. Common ones include oxygen sensors, crankshaft position sensors, and ABS sensors. Symptoms can vary depending on the sensor, but often involve a check engine light, poor engine performance, or issues with safety systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis identifies the faulty sensor, followed by replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the sensor and labor required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **COMAND System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The COMAND infotainment system can experience various glitches and malfunctions. These can include screen freezing, unresponsive buttons, navigation errors, or Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. If that doesn't work, the COMAND unit may need to be reprogrammed or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and the need for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While Mercedes-Benz has improved rust prevention, some G-Wagons, especially those driven in areas with harsh winters or coastal environments, can experience rust, particularly around body seams, door edges, and undercarriage components.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involves removing the rust, treating the affected area, and repainting. In severe cases, body panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can be prone to issues, including getting stuck, making excessive noise, or leaking.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves inspecting the sunroof tracks, motor, and seals. Lubrication may resolve minor issues. More significant problems may require component replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the issue and parts required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Mercedes-Benz G65 AMG, while a luxurious and powerful vehicle, can be prone to some significant issues. Engine-related problems, especially oil leaks and turbocharger issues on the V12 engine, can be costly to repair. Air suspension and electrical gremlins are also fairly common and can contribute to overall ownership costs. While not necessarily widespread, the potential for these issues should be considered when purchasing a used G65 AMG. The severity of the issues ranges from minor sensor malfunctions to major engine or transmission repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Thorough inspection and maintenance records are crucial when evaluating a used G65 AMG.
