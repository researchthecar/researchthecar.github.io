The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLC63 AMG is a performance SUV that blends luxury with the raw power of AMG engineering. The GLC63 AMG is available with a hand-built 4.0L Biturbo V8 engine producing 469 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque in the standard GLC63, and a more potent version producing 503 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque in the GLC63 S. Both versions are mated to an AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GLC63 AMG for its exhilarating acceleration, sporty handling, and luxurious interior. However, some common complaints include the firm ride quality, particularly on rough roads, and the high running costs associated with a performance vehicle.
