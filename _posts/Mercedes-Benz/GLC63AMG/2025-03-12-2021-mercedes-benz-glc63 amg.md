The 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLC63 AMG is a performance SUV that blends luxury with raw power. It's available in both standard SUV and coupe body styles, offering a distinct aesthetic. While the GLC lineup features other engines such as a 2.0L turbo 4 cylinder, and other AMG variants with slightly lower outputs, the GLC63 AMG boasts a hand-built 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 469 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. The AMG-enhanced SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9-speed transmission is standard. Owners often praise the GLC63 AMG for its blistering acceleration, agile handling, and luxurious interior. However, some common complaints revolve around the firm ride quality, high fuel consumption, and the complex infotainment system.
