The 2020 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is a high-performance luxury sedan known for its powerful engine, agile handling, and luxurious interior. It came standard with a handcrafted 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing 603 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. The E63 S variant also utilizes the same 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine, but is tuned to produce even more power at 603 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission (AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9-speed). Owners often praise the car's explosive acceleration, comfortable ride (especially with the air suspension), and its blend of luxury and performance. Criticisms sometimes include the high price tag and the potential for costly maintenance and repairs.
