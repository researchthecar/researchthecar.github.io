The 2010 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is a high-performance sedan known for its powerful engine and luxurious features. The E63 AMG was only offered with one engine option: the naturally aspirated 6.2L M156 V8 engine which produced 518 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with the AMG Speedshift MCT 7-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the car's raw power, handling, and luxurious interior. However, they often note the high running costs, including fuel consumption and maintenance, as well as potential reliability issues.
