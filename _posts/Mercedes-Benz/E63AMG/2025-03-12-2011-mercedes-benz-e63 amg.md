The 2011 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is a performance sedan known for its powerful engine and luxurious features. The primary engine option is a 6.2L naturally aspirated V8 producing 518 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque (though some models had the optional AMG Performance Package that bumped those figures to 550 hp and 590 lb-ft, respectively.) The transmission is a 7-speed MCT (Multi-Clutch Transmission) automatic. Owners generally love the car's raw power, comfortable interior, and distinctive styling. Common dislikes often involve the car's high running costs, including fuel consumption, maintenance, and potential repair bills.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (early M156 engines) are prone to failure. Symptoms include engine ticking noise, loss of power, and eventually engine damage if not addressed. Broken bolts can cause catastrophic engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the original bolts with the updated, stronger version. This is a preventative measure often recommended even before symptoms appear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of damage, if any). This can include engine removal if bolts have broken and entered the engine.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve lifters can experience wear and develop a ticking noise, especially when cold. Over time, this can lead to reduced engine performance and potential damage to the camshafts.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected valve lifters. In some cases, camshaft replacement might also be necessary if they are worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+ (depending on the extent of wear and components needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Higher-than-normal oil consumption is sometimes reported, particularly in engines with higher mileage or those not properly maintained.
    *   Solution: Inspect for leaks, check valve stem seals, and consider piston ring condition. Depending on the cause, repairs can range from simple seal replacement to a more involved engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8,000+ (depending on the source of the consumption, and complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed MCT (Multi-Clutch Transmission)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rough or jerky shifting, especially at lower speeds or during downshifts. Hesitation when accelerating can also occur.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid and filter change, ensuring the correct fluid type is used. If the problem persists, valve body issues may require repair or replacement. Transmission adaptation reset may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ (depending on the repair needed; fluid change is at the lower end, valve body replacement at the higher end)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration felt throughout the car, especially during acceleration and deceleration. Clunking noises can also be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the transmission mount.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (Airmatic)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Airmatic air suspension system is prone to leaks and compressor failures. Symptoms include the car sitting unevenly, a suspension malfunction warning light, and the compressor running constantly or not at all.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair air leaks (usually in the air struts or air lines). Replace the air compressor if it is failing. Air struts might need replacement if they are leaking or failing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on which components need replacing; individual struts can be expensive)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery can drain quickly, especially if the car sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the parasitic draw using diagnostic tools. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the source and complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Control Module Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning power seats. Seat no longer moves forward, backward, up, or down.
    *   Solution: Replace the seat control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture build-up inside the headlight housing.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headlight housing. Depending on severity some have success using a heat gun to dry it out, but this is a temporary fix at best.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on whether you replace one or both).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Delamination/Discoloration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop a sticky or gooey texture, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard is often the only permanent solution. Some owners opt for reupholstering or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $4,000+ (for full dashboard replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Command System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Navigation, audio, or display malfunctions within the COMAND system. This can include freezing, unresponsive buttons, or distorted audio.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. If the problem is hardware-related, the COMAND unit might need repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ (depending on the issue and repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is a high-performance vehicle with inherent maintenance requirements. The most concerning issues revolve around the engine (camshaft adjuster bolts, valve lifters, and oil consumption) and the air suspension system. The transmission can also present issues, and electrical problems are not uncommon in modern Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Repair costs can be significant, especially for engine or suspension work. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic experienced with Mercedes-Benz AMG models to identify any existing or potential issues.
