The 2018 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is a high-performance sedan known for its powerful engine, luxurious interior, and advanced technology. The heart of the E63 AMG is a hand-built 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that produces 603 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. The E63S variant boasts even higher output. This engine is paired exclusively with a 9-speed automatic transmission (MCT - Multi Clutch Technology). Owners typically praise the car's exhilarating acceleration, sharp handling, and opulent cabin. Some criticisms include its relatively high price, firm ride (even in comfort mode), and potential for costly repairs.
