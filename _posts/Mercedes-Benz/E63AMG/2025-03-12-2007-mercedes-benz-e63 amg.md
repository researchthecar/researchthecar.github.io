This engine delivers 507 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque, making it a thrilling driving experience. It was equipped with a 7G-Tronic automatic transmission. People often praise the E63 AMG for its robust engine, comfortable interior, and blend of luxury and performance. Some common dislikes include its high fuel consumption, potential for costly repairs, and complex electronics.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (also known as camshaft sprocket bolts) are prone to failure. These bolts can shear off, leading to significant engine damage. Symptoms may include a ticking or rattling noise from the engine, especially on cold starts, check engine light, or complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the original camshaft adjuster bolts with updated, higher-strength bolts. This often involves removing the valve covers, camshafts, and installing the new bolts to the specified torque.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and if performed at a dealer or independent shop).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter/Hydraulic Tappet Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or clicking noise, especially at idle or low RPMs, indicating worn or failing hydraulic valve lifters. The noise may diminish as the engine warms up, but often returns.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty valve lifters is necessary. This can be a labor-intensive job, as it requires access to the valve train components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on how many lifters need replacement and labor rates).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold is made from plastic, and it is known to crack which can cause a vacuum leak. This will lead to a rough idle, misfires, and reduced engine performance. The check engine light will likely be illuminated as well.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold with an updated plastic or aluminum version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7G-Tronic (722.9)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, or complete loss of gear engagement. These symptoms often stem from worn valve body components, such as solenoids or valve bores.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body is usually the recommended solution. In some cases, individual solenoids can be replaced. Flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on whether the valve body is rebuilt or replaced and whether it's done at a dealer or independent shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The conductor plate, which houses the transmission control unit (TCU) and various sensors, is known to fail. Symptoms include transmission going into limp mode (stuck in a single gear), erratic shifting, or a complete loss of transmission function. Diagnostic codes will typically indicate issues with the TCU or sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the conductor plate and potentially the TCU. Requires programming the new TCU to the vehicle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (Airmatic)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E63 AMG is equipped with an Airmatic air suspension system, which can be prone to issues. Common problems include air leaks in the air struts, a failing air compressor, or a faulty valve block. Symptoms include the car sitting unevenly, a noisy air compressor, or the car not raising or lowering properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty air struts, air compressor, or valve block. Diagnosing the exact cause of the problem is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per strut, $500 - $1,500 for the compressor, $300 - $800 for the valve block (parts and labor costs vary widely).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Electronic Control Unit (ECU) or Module Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electronic modules, such as the ECU, SAM (Signal Acquisition Module), or door control modules, can fail. This can lead to a wide range of issues, including engine performance problems, electrical component malfunctions, or communication errors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is critical to identify the faulty module. Replacement and programming of the new module are typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per module (depending on the module and complexity of programming).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the car sits for an extended period. This can be due to a parasitic drain caused by a faulty module or electrical component.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic drain through a process of elimination, testing individual circuits and components. Repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the source of the drain and the repair needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*No Issues Found*

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can fail, causing it to become stuck, noisy, or not operate smoothly.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, regulator, or other components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2007 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, while a thrilling performance sedan, is prone to several issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most significant concern revolves around the 6.2L M156 engine, particularly the camshaft adjuster bolts, valve lifters and intake manifold. Transmission issues related to the valve body and conductor plate are also common. Suspension problems with the Airmatic system can also be costly to address. Electrical gremlins, such as module failures and battery drain, can add to the ownership expenses. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, so a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are crucial before purchasing this vehicle. Addressing these issues proactively can help ensure a more enjoyable and reliable ownership experience.
