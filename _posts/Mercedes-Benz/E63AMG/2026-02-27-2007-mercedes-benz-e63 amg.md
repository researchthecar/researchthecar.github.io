### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is a powerful and luxurious performance sedan. While its core powertrain is generally strong, potential owners should be aware of specific issues common to high-performance vehicles of this era. The M156 engine can develop camshaft wear and oil leaks, while the 7G-Tronic transmission may experience torque converter or valve body problems. The advanced suspension systems, particularly ABC, can be costly to repair if leaks or pump failures occur. Electrical gremlins, often related to the SAM unit, are also a possibility. Interior components like headliners can degrade over time. Despite these potential issues, with diligent maintenance and proactive addressing of known problems, the E63 AMG can remain a rewarding and reliable performance car.
