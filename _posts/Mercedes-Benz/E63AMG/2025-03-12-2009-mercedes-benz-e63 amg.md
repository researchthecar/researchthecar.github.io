The 2009 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is a high-performance luxury sedan known for its powerful engine and sporty driving dynamics. It came exclusively with a 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 engine, producing 507 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission). Owners generally appreciate the car's robust engine, comfortable ride, and luxurious interior, but often mention concerns about fuel economy, maintenance costs, and some specific mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**6.2L M156 V8**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Bolts Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original camshaft adjuster bolts (also referred to as camshaft holding bolts or timing chain guide rail bolts) in the M156 engine are known to be prone to failure, especially in earlier production years like 2009. These bolts can shear off, leading to significant engine damage including internal failure. Symptoms may include a ticking noise from the engine, rough running, or even complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the old bolts with the updated, stronger bolts. In cases where the original bolts have failed, the mechanic will have to inspect the engine for further damage such as damaged camshaft adjusters, timing chain, or valve train components. It is often recommended to replace the timing chain and related components at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+, depending on the extent of damage and what needs replacing. Replacing the bolts preventatively can be less costly, around $1,000 - $3,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Lifter (Hydraulic Tappet) Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve lifters (hydraulic tappets) in the M156 engine can experience premature wear, leading to excessive valve noise (ticking or knocking sound, especially when the engine is cold).
    *   Solution: Replace the worn valve lifters. This often involves removing the camshafts and replacing all the lifters to ensure uniform performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Higher than expected oil consumption can occur in the M156 engine. This can be due to worn valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: A leakdown test can help determine where the oil is being lost. The most common solutions are to replace the valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ depending on whether valve stem seals or piston rings need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed sports transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT 7-speed transmission can experience harsh shifting, particularly between lower gears. Delayed engagement when shifting from Park or Neutral into Drive or Reverse is also sometimes reported.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, it may require valve body repair or replacement. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush/filter change: $300 - $600; Valve body repair/replacement: $1,500 - $3,500; Transmission rebuild/replacement: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter problems can manifest as shuddering at low speeds, particularly when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Airmatic Suspension Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Airmatic suspension system can suffer from leaks in the air struts, compressor failure, or issues with the valve block. Symptoms include the car sitting unevenly, a suspension malfunction warning light, or the inability to adjust the ride height.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component that is failing (strut, compressor, valve block). Replace the faulty component. It is often recommended to replace air struts in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Air strut replacement: $1,000 - $2,500 per strut; Compressor replacement: $800 - $1,500; Valve block replacement: $500 - $1,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, especially when the car is not driven frequently. This can be caused by a faulty module not going into sleep mode, a parasitic drain from an aftermarket accessory, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the battery drain using a multimeter. Replace the faulty component or address the parasitic drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the cause of the drain, from $100 for a battery replacement to $500+ for diagnosing and fixing a parasitic draw.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions in various ECUs can lead to a wide range of issues, including engine misfires, transmission problems, and malfunctioning accessories.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific ECU that is failing. Reflash or replace the ECU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the ECU and the complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headlights on these models can sometimes experience issues such as fogging, condensation buildup, or failure of the HID bulbs or ballasts.
    *   Solution: Clean or reseal the headlight assembly. Replace the HID bulbs or ballasts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Bulb replacement: $100-$300; Ballast Replacement $400-$800, Headlight Assembly Replacement $800-$2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Command System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The COMAND (Cockpit Management and Data) system can experience glitches, screen failures, or problems with the navigation system.
    *   Solution: Software update, replacement of the COMAND unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update $100-$300, Replacement $1,000-$3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters may stop working due to a broken heating element or a faulty control module.
    *   Solution: Replace the heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG offers exhilarating performance, but it's crucial to be aware of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the camshaft adjuster bolts, can be very costly. Transmission and suspension issues are also common and can add to the ownership expense. Electrical and interior problems are less common, but still possible. Overall, prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic experienced with Mercedes-Benz vehicles and be prepared for potentially higher-than-average maintenance costs.
