### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is a robust performance sedan, but its high-strung nature means certain components, particularly in the engine and transmission, can require attention. Issues with turbocharger wastegates, intercooler leaks, and the 7-speed MCT transmission's torque converter or mechatronics unit are the most commonly cited non-wear-and-tear problems. Electrical gremlins, especially with the COMAND infotainment system and parking sensors, can also arise. While the suspension and general interior/exterior build are generally reliable, owners should be prepared for potentially significant repair costs associated with the specialized AMG components. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for maintaining this high-performance vehicle.
