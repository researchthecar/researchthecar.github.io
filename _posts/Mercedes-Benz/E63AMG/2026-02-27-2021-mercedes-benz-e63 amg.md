### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG demonstrates strong overall reliability, characteristic of its premium segment. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to its high-performance nature and complex systems. Potential issues include coolant leaks and wastegate actuator problems within the potent 4.0L V8 engine, and occasional harsh shifting from the SPEEDSHIFT MCT transmission. The advanced AMG RIDE CONTROL+ suspension can be susceptible to air spring leaks. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and premature 12V battery drain, are also noted. Exterior lighting can sometimes experience condensation. Interior climate control issues, like blower motor failure, are less common but possible. While these issues exist, they are generally manageable with proper diagnosis and repair, and do not detract significantly from the vehicle's overall appeal as a performance luxury sedan.
