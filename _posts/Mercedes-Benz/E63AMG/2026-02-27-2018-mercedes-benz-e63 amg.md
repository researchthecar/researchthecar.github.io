### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is generally a robust performance sedan. The primary areas that have seen some documented issues are related to the complex powertrain and suspension systems, specifically wastegate actuators on the V8 engine, potential leaks in the intercooler system, and occasional transmission shifting anomalies. The air suspension, while offering excellent ride quality, can be prone to leaks over time. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. However, these issues are not universally reported and often fall within the expected range for a high-performance vehicle of this caliber. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any warning signs are crucial for maintaining its reliability.
