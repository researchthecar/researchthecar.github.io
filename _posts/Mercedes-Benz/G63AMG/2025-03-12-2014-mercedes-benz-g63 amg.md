The 2014 Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG is a high-performance SUV known for its luxurious appointments, rugged off-road capabilities, and distinctive boxy design. Its powerful engine and advanced drivetrain deliver impressive acceleration and all-terrain performance. A few common dislikes include the vehicle's high price tag, considerable fuel consumption, and somewhat dated interior design compared to newer models. The 2014 G63 AMG is equipped with a 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 536 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed automatic transmission (7G-TRONIC). The G550 from this year has a naturally aspirated 5.5L V8 with 382 horsepower.

**Engine**

**5.5L Twin-Turbo V8 (M157)**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are a common issue, often originating from the valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing, or the rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. In severe cases, the oil filter housing itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+, depending on the source and complexity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbochargers on the M157 engine can fail due to oil starvation, excessive heat, or general wear and tear. Symptoms include reduced power, increased turbocharger noise (whining or screeching), and potentially error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty turbocharger(s). It's often recommended to replace both turbos simultaneously for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+, depending on labor and parts costs (genuine Mercedes vs. aftermarket).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light Related to Oxygen Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oxygen sensor failures are relatively common, leading to a check engine light. Symptoms may include decreased fuel efficiency and/or slightly rougher engine operation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oxygen sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+, depending on the sensor location and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.5L Naturally Aspirated V8**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC (722.9)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or when downshifting.
    *   Solution: This issue is sometimes resolved with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter shudder or failure can occur, leading to vibrations, poor acceleration, and potential transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter, potentially along with a transmission flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The G63 AMG utilizes an air suspension system, which can be prone to leaks in the air struts, compressor failures, or issues with the air distribution valve. Symptoms include a sagging vehicle, ride height issues, error messages on the dashboard, and a noisy air compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air struts, air compressor, or air distribution valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ per strut, $800-$1500+ for compressor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Electronic Gremlins**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical issues can arise, including problems with the infotainment system, navigation, parking sensors, and other electronic features. These issues can manifest as intermittent failures, error messages, or non-functional components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific electrical fault and replacing the affected component or wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable, depending on the nature of the issue. $100 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, particularly if the vehicle is left unused for extended periods.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the parasitic drain (e.g., faulty module, improperly installed aftermarket accessories) and addressing it. In some cases, a new battery may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause. Battery replacement approximately $300-$500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in specific regions)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop, especially in areas prone to salt exposure (snowy regions). Common areas include under the door seals, around the wheel wells, and the frame.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which involves sanding, treating, and repainting affected areas. More severe rust may require panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ per affected area.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof mechanism can experience problems, such as getting stuck, making excessive noise, or leaking.

**Summary**

The 2014 Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG, while a desirable vehicle, can present owners with a range of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly oil leaks and turbocharger failures on the 5.5L twin-turbo V8, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, especially harsh shifting, are also a concern. Air suspension issues, electrical gremlins, and potential rust are additional factors to consider. The severity of these issues varies, but it's essential to be aware of these potential problems when considering purchasing a used 2014 G63 AMG. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for more extensive repairs. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified Mercedes-Benz mechanic is highly recommended.
