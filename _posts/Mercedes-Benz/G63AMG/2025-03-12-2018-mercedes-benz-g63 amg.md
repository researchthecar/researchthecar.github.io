The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG is a high-performance SUV known for its ruggedness, luxurious interior, and powerful engine. The sole engine option for this model year is a hand-built 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, producing 563 horsepower and 561 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 7G-TRONIC automatic transmission. People often praise the G63 for its iconic styling, off-road capabilities, and impressive performance, while common complaints include its high price tag, poor fuel economy, and somewhat dated interior design compared to more modern SUVs.

**Engine**

**5.5L Twin-Turbocharged V8**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine bay, reduced power, check engine light. Often caused by oil starvation or bearing failure within the turbocharger.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger(s). It is often recommended to replace both turbos at the same time to ensure even performance.

**Summary**

The 2018 Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG, while a desirable vehicle, can suffer from some notable issues. The most significant potential problems revolve around the engine (turbocharger failures and oil leaks), transmission (rough shifting), and air suspension (leaks and malfunctions). Electrical glitches with the COMAND system and sensor failures are also relatively common. The cost of repairing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major repairs like turbocharger or suspension replacements. Owners should be diligent with maintenance and address any unusual symptoms promptly to mitigate potential problems.
