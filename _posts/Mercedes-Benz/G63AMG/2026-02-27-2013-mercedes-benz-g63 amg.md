### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG is a highly capable and luxurious SUV, but its performance-oriented nature and complex systems mean potential for specific technical issues. The twin-turbo V8 engine, while powerful, can experience issues with wastegate actuators and the PCV system. The AMG transmission may encounter torque converter seal leaks or TCM problems. The adaptive suspension dampers are also a noted area for potential failure. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the COMAND infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, can also arise. While many components are robust, owners should be prepared for potentially costly repairs related to these specific areas, especially as the vehicle ages.
