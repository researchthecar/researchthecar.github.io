The 2022 Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG is a high-performance SUV known for its iconic boxy design, luxurious interior, and powerful engine. It's equipped with a handcrafted 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine producing 577 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. The G63 is paired with a AMG SPEEDSHIFT TCT 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its off-road capabilities, distinctive styling, and strong performance.
