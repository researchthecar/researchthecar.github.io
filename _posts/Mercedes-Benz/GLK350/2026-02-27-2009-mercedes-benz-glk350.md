### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 presents a generally solid reliability record, but like many German luxury vehicles of this era, it is not immune to specific, potentially costly issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 3.5L V6 engine, particularly the intake manifold runner actuator and balance shaft gear wear, which can lead to substantial repair bills. The 7-speed automatic transmission can also experience problems with the valve body or torque converter. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and headlight modules, are also noted. While suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically robust, owners should be prepared for potential maintenance related to the powertrain and electrical systems. Regular servicing and prompt attention to warning lights are crucial for mitigating these risks.
