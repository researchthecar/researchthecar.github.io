**Engine**

**3.5L V6 (M276)**
* **Oil Filter Housing/Cooler Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common around the oil filter housing and/or oil cooler. This can result in oil dripping onto the engine or the ground, and a burning oil smell may be present.
    * Solution: Replacement of the oil filter housing and/or cooler, along with associated gaskets, is the standard repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

* **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Cam Magnet) Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the camshaft adjuster solenoids (also called cam magnets). This can result in oil dripping onto the engine or the ground.
    * Solution: Replacement of the cam magnets and sealant. An updated part number may be available.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**Transmission**

**7G-TRONIC (722.9)**

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can progress to harsh shifting and eventual transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, sometimes along with a transmission flush and filter replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or getting stuck in a gear. Can also cause the transmission to go into limp mode.
    * Solution: Replacement or repair of the valve body. This may involve replacing solenoids or other internal components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Squeaking, creaking, or knocking noises coming from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. May also experience vague steering feel.
    * Solution: Replacement of the front strut mounts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600

**Electrical**

* **EIS (Electronic Ignition Switch) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Key not recognized, difficulty starting the vehicle, or complete failure to start. The EIS is responsible for reading the key and communicating with the engine control unit.
    * Solution: Replacement of the EIS, which requires programming to match the vehicle's key and immobilizer system.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

* **SAM (Signal Acquisition Module) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic electrical behavior, such as lights not working, wipers malfunctioning, or other electronic components failing. SAM units control various electrical functions in the vehicle.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to determine which SAM unit is failing (front or rear), followed by replacement and programming of the new SAM unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ depending on the SAM unit.

**Exterior**

* **Rear Tail Light Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the clear plastic lens of the rear tail lights. This can allow moisture to enter the tail light assembly, potentially damaging the bulbs and circuitry.
    * Solution: Replacement of the entire tail light assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per tail light.

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may become stuck, make excessive noise during operation, or fail to close properly. This can be due to damaged tracks, a faulty motor, or debris interfering with the mechanism.
    * Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of the problem, followed by repair or replacement of the affected components (tracks, motor, etc.).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the severity.

**Summary**

The 2012 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues listed above. The oil leaks and torque converter issues are relatively common and can be costly to repair. EIS and SAM failures are also potential concerns. While some issues are minor, others can be quite expensive, so a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
