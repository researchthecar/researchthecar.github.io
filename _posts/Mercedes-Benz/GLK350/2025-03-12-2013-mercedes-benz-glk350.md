The 2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK350 has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, such as camshaft adjuster failure and oil leaks, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems with the 7G-TRONIC transmission, including torque converter issues and valve body failures, are also prevalent and can lead to expensive repairs. Suspension issues, specifically with the lower control arm bushings and rear subframe bushings, can affect handling and ride quality. Electrical problems, such as EIS failure and SAM module issues, can also occur. Overall, while the GLK350 offers a luxurious driving experience, potential buyers should be prepared for potentially higher-than-average maintenance and repair costs, with repairs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the issue.
