**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Camshaft Adjuster Solenoid (Camshaft Magnet) Oil Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from the camshaft adjuster solenoid (also known as a camshaft magnet). This can cause a burning oil smell and, if left unattended, can contaminate other components.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking camshaft adjuster solenoid and clean any surrounding areas affected by the oil leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light with Camshaft Position Sensor Fault Codes**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates with codes related to camshaft position sensors (e.g., P0016, P0017, P0018, P0019). These codes can indicate a faulty sensor or a problem with the camshaft timing.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft position sensor(s). In some cases, the camshaft adjuster may also need to be inspected.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per sensor
