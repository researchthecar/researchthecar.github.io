The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLA180 is a subcompact luxury crossover known for its stylish design and fuel efficiency. The GLA180 comes equipped with a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 122 horsepower and 200 Nm of torque. Other engine options available in the GLA range include the GLA 200, GLA 250, and the performance-oriented AMG GLA 45, each offering increased power and performance. The GLA180 is typically paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Owners often praise the GLA180 for its comfortable ride, upscale interior, and manageable size, making it easy to maneuver in urban environments. Common complaints include the somewhat cramped rear seating, the limited cargo space compared to some competitors, and the sometimes-hesitant response of the dual-clutch transmission at low speeds.
