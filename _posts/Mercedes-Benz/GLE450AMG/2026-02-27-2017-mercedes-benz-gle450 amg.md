### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLE450 AMG is a powerful and luxurious SUV, but its complexity can lead to specific reliability concerns. The 3.0L twin-turbo V6 engine, while potent, can experience issues with turbochargers and coolant leaks. The 9-speed automatic transmission may develop problems with harsh shifting or leaks. Owners with the optional AIRMATIC air suspension should be prepared for potential leaks or compressor failures.
