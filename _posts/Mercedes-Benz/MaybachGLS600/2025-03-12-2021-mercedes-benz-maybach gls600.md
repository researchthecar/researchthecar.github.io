The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Maybach GLS600 represents the pinnacle of luxury SUVs, offering a serene and opulent driving experience. It's powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine producing 550 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9G-TRONIC nine-speed automatic transmission. While lauded for its lavish interior, exceptional ride quality (thanks to the E-Active Body Control suspension), and advanced technology, some owners have reported certain issues. Dislikes often center on the high price tag and potential complexity of the advanced systems, which can lead to maintenance concerns. There is no other engine/transmission options for the Maybach GLS600.

**Suspension**

*   **E-Active Body Control Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-Active Body Control system, designed to provide a smooth and level ride, can sometimes experience failures. Symptoms include the vehicle leaning excessively in corners, the system displaying error messages on the instrument cluster, or the inability to adjust the suspension settings.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified Mercedes-Benz technician is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause. Repairs may involve replacing faulty sensors, hydraulic pumps, or control modules related to the E-Active Body Control system. A software update may sometimes resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MBUX System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: A software update is often the first step to resolving MBUX issues. If the problem persists, a system reset or replacement of the MBUX control unit may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,500+ (control unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Issues (Parking Sensors, Driver Assist Systems)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The advanced driver-assistance systems, such as parking sensors, lane keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control, rely on numerous sensors. These sensors can sometimes malfunction, leading to false alarms, system deactivation, or impaired functionality.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves scanning the vehicle's computer for error codes and testing the individual sensors. Faulty sensors will need to be replaced and potentially recalibrated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive battery drain can leave owners stranded with a dead battery. This issue may stem from a parasitic draw caused by a faulty module, improperly shut down electronics, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic test to measure current draw is required. Once the source of the parasitic draw is identified, the faulty component can be repaired or replaced. Replacing the battery itself might be necessary if it has been damaged due to repeated deep discharges.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Diagnostic Testing) - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the sunroof or moonroof, including difficulty opening or closing, unusual noises, or leaks.
    *   Solution: The cause of the problem may be a faulty motor, damaged tracks, or a malfunctioning seal. Repairing or replacing the affected components is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Trim Pieces Coming Loose**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Certain interior trim pieces, particularly those made of wood or metal, may come loose or detach over time.
    *   Solution: Loose trim pieces can typically be reattached using adhesive or replacement clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+

    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Running Board Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic running boards, designed to deploy when the doors are opened, may fail to extend or retract properly.
    *   Solution: Inspecting the motors, hinges, and sensors of the running board mechanism. Replacing faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Mercedes-Benz Maybach GLS600 is a highly luxurious vehicle with advanced systems. While it delivers an exceptional experience, potential issues related to the complex E-Active Body Control suspension, the MBUX infotainment system, sensor malfunctions, and other electrical and interior components should be considered. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more significant mechanical or electronic failures. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the nature and extent of the problem, potentially reaching several thousand dollars for major repairs. Overall, while not widespread, awareness of these potential issues is prudent for prospective buyers.
