### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Mercedes-Benz LO 915 demonstrates good overall reliability, consistent with Mercedes-Benz's reputation in the commercial vehicle sector. The primary areas that may require attention beyond routine maintenance include the turbocharger and EGR system on the OM904LA engine, and potential wear on clutch components in manual transmissions. Electrical system issues, particularly wiring harness corrosion, can arise due to the demanding operational environment. While body panel corrosion is a possibility, it is often manageable with timely intervention. The LO 915 remains a solid choice for commercial applications when properly maintained, with most reported issues being repairable and not indicative of systemic design flaws.
