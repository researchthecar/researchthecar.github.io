The 2009 Mercedes-Benz LO 915 is a light-duty truck/bus chassis popular in Latin America and other developing markets. It was commonly equipped with the Mercedes-Benz OM 904 LA engine. This engine is a 4.3L inline-4 turbodiesel, producing around 150 hp and 430 lb-ft of torque. Other engines that may have been available depending on market include the OM 906 LA, a 6.4L inline-6 turbodiesel. Transmission options typically included manual transmissions, such as the G85-6. Owners generally appreciate the LO 915 for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and robust construction. However, some dislike its relatively basic features and ride quality compared to more modern vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2009 Mercedes-Benz LO 915, while generally reliable, faces some common issues related to its engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Engine issues mainly revolve around injector and turbocharger issues for the OM 904 LA and EGR valve issues for the OM 906 LA, while transmission problems are associated with hard shifting and synchronizer wear. Suspension concerns relate to leaf spring and shock absorber wear. Electrical problems stem from wiring harness and alternator failures. Rust formation is an exterior concern, and dashboard cracking can affect the interior. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly, but addressing these issues promptly is crucial for maintaining the vehicle's reliability and safety.
