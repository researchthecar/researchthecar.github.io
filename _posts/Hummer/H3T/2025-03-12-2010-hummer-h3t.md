The 2010 Hummer H3T is a unique mid-size pickup truck known for its distinctive Hummer styling and off-road capabilities. It came standard with a 3.7L inline-5 engine producing 242 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, as well as an available 5.3L V8 producing 300 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. The inline-5 engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 was exclusively paired with the 4-speed automatic. People liked the H3T for its rugged appearance, off-road prowess, and relative rarity. Common dislikes included its fuel economy, somewhat cramped interior, and the dated design even at the time.

**Engine**

**3.7L Inline-5**

*   **Camshaft Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, poor acceleration, and potential engine misfires. The camshaft actuator can wear prematurely, leading to improper timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft actuator and potentially the camshaft itself, depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cylinder Head Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine misfires. The cylinder head can develop cracks, leading to coolant leaks into the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level, blue smoke from the exhaust, and the need to add oil frequently between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, the solution could range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive engine work such as replacing piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Active Fuel Management (AFM) Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough idling, engine misfires, and potential engine damage. The AFM lifters can fail, leading to camshaft damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed AFM lifters, camshaft, and potentially other related components. Disabling the AFM system is also a common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60E 4-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, and potential transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Could range from a fluid flush and filter change to a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, poor acceleration, and potential transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**NV3500 5-Speed Manual (3.7L Only)**

*No Issues Found*

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal, reduced ride quality, and potential for bottoming out.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs or installation of add-a-leaf kits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Transfer Case Encoder Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Service 4WD light, inability to shift between 2WD, 4HI, and 4LO, and grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the transfer case encoder motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as lights not working, power windows malfunctioning, and issues with the security system.

**Summary**

The 2010 Hummer H3T, while stylish and capable, has a range of potential issues. The engine issues, especially the camshaft actuator and cylinder head issues with the 3.7L engine, and AFM lifter failure in the 5.3L, can be costly to repair. Transmission slipping is a common issue. The suspension and electrical problems also contribute to potential repair bills. Rust on the frame is a significant concern, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase. The cost of repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage.
