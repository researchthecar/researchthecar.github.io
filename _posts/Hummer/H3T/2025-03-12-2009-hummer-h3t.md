The 2009 Hummer H3T is a mid-size pickup truck known for its off-road capabilities and distinctive Hummer styling. Engine options included a 3.7L inline-5 cylinder engine producing approximately 242 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 engine producing approximately 300 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual (available only with the I5 engine) and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the H3T's ruggedness and unique appearance, but dislike its relatively poor fuel economy and somewhat cramped interior for its size.

**Engine**

**3.7L Inline-5 Cylinder**

*   **Cylinder Head Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss with no visible leaks, overheating, white smoke from the exhaust. Often occurs around cylinder #5.
    *   Solution: Replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the front of the engine, especially upon startup. Can lead to poor performance and eventual engine failure.
    * Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Often noticeable after the engine has aged.
    *   Solution: Replacing valve seals or piston rings to resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lifter Failure (Specifically AFM/DOD Lifters)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, misfires, and reduced power. Commonly affects engines equipped with Active Fuel Management (AFM), also known as Displacement on Demand (DOD).
    *   Solution: Replace the failed lifters and potentially the camshaft. Consider disabling AFM/DOD system to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60-E 4-Speed Automatic (Used with both I5 and V8)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough shifts, delays in engaging gears, slipping, and/or complete loss of gear engagement.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the transmission. Solenoids, valve body, or internal hard part failure are the most common causes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, stalling, or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Excessive tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Humming or grinding noise from the front wheel area that increases with speed. Play in the wheel when shaken.
    *   Solution: Replace the wheel bearing assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, or lights. Can cause starting issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and reprogram or replace the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Chafing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems caused by wires rubbing against the chassis or other components, leading to shorts.
    *   Solution: Locate the chafed wires, repair or replace them, and protect the harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the severity and location of the damage)

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises from behind the dashboard, failure of the HVAC system to direct air properly (e.g., only blowing hot air or not switching between vents).
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty HVAC actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the location of the actuator)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Hummer H3T, while a capable and stylish truck, is prone to several common issues. Engine problems, particularly cylinder head cracking on the 3.7L I5 and oil consumption and lifter failure on the 5.3L V8, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the 4L60-E are also prevalent. Suspension and electrical problems can add to the overall maintenance costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect any H3T before purchasing, and ideally obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic. Some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, but engine or transmission overhauls can be significant financial burdens.
