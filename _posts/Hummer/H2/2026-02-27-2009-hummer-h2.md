### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Hummer H2, while a capable and distinctive vehicle, requires diligent maintenance and awareness of potential problem areas. The V8 engine, though powerful, can be prone to coolant and oil leaks as it ages, necessitating regular inspections. The automatic transmission is a common source of concern, with overheating and slipping issues requiring significant repair costs. Suspension components, particularly ball joints, can wear out, and electrical gremlins like window regulators and instrument cluster failures are not uncommon. Exterior chrome trim can also degrade. Despite these potential issues, the interior generally holds up well. Prospective buyers should factor in potential repair costs for these common issues when considering a used 2009 H2.
