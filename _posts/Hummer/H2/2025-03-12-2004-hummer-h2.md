The 2004 Hummer H2 is a large, off-road capable SUV known for its distinctive styling and powerful presence. It came standard with a 6.0L V8 engine, producing approximately 316 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Hummer H2 for its ruggedness, spacious interior, and attention-grabbing appearance. Common complaints include poor fuel economy, large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and relatively low-quality interior materials for the price point.

**Engine**

**6.0L V8 (LQ4)**

* **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Low or no oil pressure reading on the gauge, even when oil levels are adequate. This can also trigger a check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the oil pressure sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, rough idle, and potential overheating. A coolant smell may also be present.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Knock Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light. The engine control unit (ECU) may retard timing to prevent knock, further reducing power.
    * Solution: Replace the knock sensor(s) and check wiring harness for damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (cost can vary depending on sensor location and accessibility)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60-E 4-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, especially between 1st and 2nd gear.
    * Solution: Could be caused by a number of problems, including low fluid, worn valve body, or a faulty shift solenoid. A fluid flush and filter change may temporarily improve the condition. Depending on the diagnosis, a rebuild or replacement of the transmission may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $3000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine revs high without corresponding increase in vehicle speed. Loss of power while driving and delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    * Solution: This can be caused by low fluid, worn clutches, or a failing torque converter. A rebuild or replacement of the transmission may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2500 - $4500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, the "service ride control" message appearing on the driver information center, and the air compressor failing to engage or running constantly.
    * Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor, check for leaks in the air lines and air struts/springs, and ensure the system's electrical connections are secure.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the brand of replacement and labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per wheel
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gauges failing to read correctly or not reading at all, the driver information center malfunctioning, and intermittent power loss to the cluster.
    * Solution: Replacement or repair of the instrument cluster. Repair can involve soldering or replacing faulty components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery dying overnight or after the vehicle sits for a short period.

**Summary**

The 2004 Hummer H2 is prone to a variety of issues ranging from engine and transmission problems to electrical and suspension malfunctions. Engine-related issues such as oil pressure sensor failure and intake manifold gasket leaks can be relatively inexpensive to fix. Transmission problems, however, can be quite costly, especially if a rebuild or replacement is required. The suspension system, particularly the air suspension, can also present challenges. Electrical issues like instrument cluster failures are common. Although these issues can range in severity and cost, diligent maintenance and prompt repairs can help extend the life and reliability of the vehicle. Rust is a common problem in areas with harsh winters or high humidity.
