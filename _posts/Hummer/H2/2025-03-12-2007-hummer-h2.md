The 2007 Hummer H2 is a large, imposing SUV known for its off-road capabilities and distinctive styling. It came standard with a 6.0L V8 engine producing around 325 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4L65-E four-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the H2's ruggedness and spacious interior, while others criticize its poor fuel economy and cumbersome size for daily driving. Common complaints often revolve around the vehicle's age and the maintenance required for a large, complex SUV.

**Engine**

**6.0L V8**

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil pressure sensor can fail, causing inaccurate readings on the dashboard gauge or triggering a check engine light. It may falsely indicate low oil pressure even when levels are adequate.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold bolts on the 6.0L V8 are known to break, causing an exhaust leak. This can manifest as a ticking noise, especially on cold starts, and can affect engine performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts, sometimes requiring extraction of the broken bolts from the cylinder head. Using upgraded bolts is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knock Sensors Failing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The knock sensors can fail, triggering a check engine light and potentially reducing engine performance. Symptoms include reduced power and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty knock sensors. This often requires removing the intake manifold for access.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L65-E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to transmission slippage, shuddering, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts can indicate internal wear and tear, valve body issues, or solenoid problems within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Can range from fluid flush, to valve body repair, to complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Models equipped with rear air suspension can experience compressor failure, resulting in a sagging rear end and a rough ride. A warning light may illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Airbag Leaks (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air springs/bags themselves can develop leaks due to age and wear. This leads to the compressor running constantly, a sagging rear end, and eventually compressor failure if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking air springs/bags.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per air spring
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Panel Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument panel cluster can experience issues such as flickering lights, inaccurate gauge readings, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument panel cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators can fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking properly.

**Summary**

The 2007 Hummer H2, while iconic, has its share of common issues stemming from its age and complexity. Engine issues like oil pressure sensor and exhaust manifold bolt problems are frequent, while the transmission can suffer from torque converter and shifting issues. The suspension, especially if equipped with air suspension, can be prone to problems. Electrical issues with the instrument panel and door locks are also reported. Rust is a major concern, particularly in regions with road salt. Costs to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major repairs such as transmission or suspension overhauls. Given the age of these vehicles, thorough inspection and preventative maintenance are crucial for potential buyers.
