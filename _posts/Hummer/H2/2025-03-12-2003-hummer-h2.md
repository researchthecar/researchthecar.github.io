Here's a breakdown of common issues reported by owners of the 2003 Hummer H2, organized by category and component, following the format you specified.

The 2003 Hummer H2, known for its imposing size and off-road capabilities, was initially offered with a single engine option: a 6.0L Vortec V8 producing 316 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the H2's distinctive styling, roomy interior, and off-road prowess. However, some common complaints include poor fuel economy, bulky handling in urban environments, and relatively lackluster performance compared to its size and fuel consumption.

**Engine**

**6.0L Vortec V8 (LQ4)**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, often found around the front or rear of the intake manifold. Can lead to overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous or no oil pressure reading on the instrument cluster. Can sometimes cause the "check gauges" light to illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, check engine light illumination (typically P0420 or P0430 codes), rattling noise from the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on whether one or both converters need replacing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60-E Four-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting or Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting behavior, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or 2nd and 3rd gear. Slipping can be noticed by the engine revving higher than normal during acceleration without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid flush and filter change may help. More severe cases may require a rebuild or replacement of the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid and filter) to $2000 - $4000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at low speeds, especially when the torque converter is locked up. Can also lead to stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Often done during a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (if done separately)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, the air compressor running constantly, or the "service ride control" light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Leak (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, hissing sound from the airbags
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking airbags.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torsion Bar Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises, uneven ride height, or difficulty aligning the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Inspection and potential replacement of torsion bar keys or adjusting bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blower Motor Resistor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of some or all blower motor speeds for the HVAC system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as power windows not working, door locks malfunctioning, or issues with the security system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and potential replacement or reprogramming of the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Gauge Inaccuracy**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel gauge reading inaccurately, either showing empty when the tank is full or vice versa.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the fuel level sending unit or fuel pump assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the frame, body panels (especially around wheel wells and rocker panels), and undercarriage components.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, welding, and painting. In severe cases, replacement of rusted body panels or frame components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight lenses.

**Summary**

The 2003 Hummer H2, while a capable and iconic vehicle, is prone to several common issues due to its age and design. Engine-related issues such as intake manifold leaks and catalytic converter failures can be moderately expensive to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the 4L60-E, can range from relatively inexpensive fluid changes to costly rebuilds. Suspension issues, especially with the air suspension system (if equipped), can also add to the ownership costs. Rust is a major concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering the purchase of a 2003 Hummer H2.
