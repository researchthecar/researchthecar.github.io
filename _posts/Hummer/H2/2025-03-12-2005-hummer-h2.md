The 2005 Hummer H2 is a full-size SUV known for its bold styling and off-road capabilities. The sole engine option for this year was the 6.0L Vortec V8, producing around 325 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with the 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the Hummer H2 for its distinctive appearance and spacious interior, while others dislike its poor fuel economy and large size, making it difficult to maneuver in urban environments.
