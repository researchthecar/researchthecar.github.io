The 2009 Hummer H2 is a large, imposing SUV known for its off-road capabilities and distinctive styling. It only came with one engine option, a 6.2L V8 producing 393 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque. The H2 is often praised for its ruggedness and spacious interior, but criticized for its poor fuel economy and cumbersome handling. The 2009 H2 was only available with a 6L80E transmission. Common complaints include issues related to the aging drivetrain, electrical problems, and the cost of maintenance.
