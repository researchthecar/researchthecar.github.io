### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Hummer H2, while built for ruggedness, is not without its potential reliability concerns. The 6.0L V8 engine is generally robust but can suffer from common GM issues like coolant and oil leaks. The 4L65-E transmission requires attention to prevent overheating and potential torque converter problems. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and tie rod ends, are subject to wear due to the vehicle's weight and intended use. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and HVAC blower motors, are also reported. Exterior trim can degrade, and interior components like the center console latch may fail. Despite these issues, many owners find the H2 to be a durable vehicle if properly maintained, with most repairs being manageable for a well-equipped mechanic.
