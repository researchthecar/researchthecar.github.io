# 2007 Hummer H2

### Overview
The 2007 Hummer H2, a vehicle known for its imposing presence and off-road capabilities, presents a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. While its robust construction is a hallmark, certain components and systems have shown a propensity for issues that can impact ownership experience and costs. Owners often report on the durability of the powertrain, but electrical systems and specific drivetrain components can be areas of concern. Regular maintenance is crucial for any vehicle of this age and complexity, but understanding common failure points can help in proactive servicing and budgeting for potential repairs. This analysis focuses on documented widespread issues beyond routine maintenance.

## Engine

### 6.0L V8 Vortec
**Cooling System Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Coolant leaks from hoses, water pump, or radiator; overheating.
- **Solution:** Replacement of leaking components (hoses, water pump, radiator).
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Oil Cooler Line Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil leaks around the oil cooler lines, potential for oil in coolant.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the oil cooler lines.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic (4L60-E)
**Torque Converter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping, shuddering, or delayed engagement; unusual noises.
- **Solution:** Rebuild or replacement of the torque converter and potentially transmission.
- **Cost:** $1,200 - $2,500

**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission fluid smells burnt; delayed shifts; overheating.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, inspection of transmission cooler.
- **Cost:** $200 - $500


## Suspension

### Independent Front Suspension
**Ball Joint Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, uneven tire wear, steering wander.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

**Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
- **Symptoms:** Vehicle sagging, compressor not engaging, error messages.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the air suspension compressor.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,000


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical components malfunctioning randomly (lights, windows, locks, dashboard lights).
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1,200


### Alternator
**Premature Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Battery warning light, dimming headlights, electrical system malfunctions.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Exterior

### Body Panels & Trim
**Rust and Corrosion**
- **Symptoms:** Rust appearing on fenders, rocker panels, and undercarriage, especially in rust-belt regions.
- **Solution:** Rust repair and preventative undercoating.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1,500+


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blend Door Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Inability to control temperature or direct airflow.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the blend door actuator.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Hummer H2, while built for ruggedness, is not without its reliability concerns. The 6.0L V8 engine is generally robust, but cooling system and oil cooler line leaks are common. The 4-speed automatic transmission can experience torque converter issues and overheating. Suspension components, particularly ball joints, are prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, and premature alternator failure are significant potential headaches. Exterior rust can be an issue in certain climates, and interior HVAC blend door actuators are a known failure point. Prospective buyers should be prepared for potential repairs, especially concerning the electrical and drivetrain systems, and factor in the cost of addressing these common issues.
