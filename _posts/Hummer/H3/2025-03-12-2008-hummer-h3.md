The 2008 Hummer H3 is a mid-size SUV known for its rugged off-road capability and distinctive styling. It came with two engine options: a 3.7L inline-5 cylinder engine producing 242 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.3L V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque, which was only available on the H3 Alpha model. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic, with the 5.3L V8 only available with the 4-speed automatic. People generally appreciate the H3 for its unique looks, off-road prowess, and relative affordability compared to larger Hummers. However, some criticisms include its fuel economy, interior quality, and somewhat sluggish performance with the inline-5 engine.

**Engine**

**3.7L Inline-5**

*   **Cylinder Head Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and loss of power. This is a common issue, especially in higher mileage vehicles.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head, often with an updated or aftermarket version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, loss of power, and engine stalling. The camshaft actuator solenoid fails, preventing the cam from properly adjusting timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the camshaft actuator solenoid and potentially the camshaft actuator itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Pressure Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erroneous low oil pressure warnings, potentially causing the engine to shut down. The sensor can fail internally or develop leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil pressure sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.3L V8**

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, often exceeding 1 quart per 1,000 miles. This can be due to worn valve stem seals or piston rings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of valve stem seals and/or piston rings. More extensive repairs may be required depending on the severity of the wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lifter Failure (AFM/DOD Related)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, rough idling, and potential misfires. This is related to the Active Fuel Management (AFM) or Displacement on Demand (DOD) system which deactivates cylinders. Lifters can collapse, leading to damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty lifters, and often recommended to disable the AFM/DOD system via a tuner or with mechanical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4L60-E 4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifting, and general erratic behavior. Can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement. Valve body repair or replacement might resolve some issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during acceleration. Can also cause stalling.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hard Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission shifts harshly into gear or while shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Front Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise coming from the front wheels, especially when turning. Can also cause excessive play in the wheel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front wheel bearing(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700 per wheel
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can cause loose steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the upper and/or lower ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per ball joint
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Hummer H3, while a capable and stylish SUV, is prone to several common issues. The 3.7L inline-5 can suffer from cylinder head cracks, and camshaft actuator failure. The 5.3L V8 is known for oil consumption and lifter failures. The 4L60-E transmission may have slipping and hard shift issues. Suspension problems include wheel bearing and ball joint failures. Electrical issues can arise with the transfer case encoder motor and body control module. These issues range in severity, with some being relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, while others, such as engine or transmission rebuilds, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
