The 2006 Hummer H3 is a mid-size SUV known for its off-road capabilities and distinctive Hummer styling. Engine options included a 3.5L Inline-5 cylinder engine producing 220 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Later in the model year, a 3.7L Inline-5 replaced the 3.5L engine, increasing horsepower to 242. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the H3's ruggedness and unique appearance, but commonly dislike its fuel economy and smaller interior space compared to other SUVs.
