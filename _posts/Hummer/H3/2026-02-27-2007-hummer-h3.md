### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Hummer H3 is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the 3.7L engine's cooling and oil systems, and the automatic transmission's tendency to overheat or fail. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, are not uncommon. While the 5.3L V8 and manual transmission variants appear more robust, overall reliability is moderate.
