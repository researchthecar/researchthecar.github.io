**Summary**

The 2009 Hummer H3 has a range of potential issues, with engine problems, particularly related to oil consumption and camshaft actuators, being a significant concern. Transmission slipping and electrical issues with the BCM and transfer case actuator are also frequently reported. Suspension components like ball joints and wheel bearings also wear out over time.
