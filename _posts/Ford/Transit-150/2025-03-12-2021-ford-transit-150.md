The 2021 Ford Transit-150 is a popular full-size van known for its versatility, spaciousness, and capability. It's a favorite for commercial use, camper conversions, and family transportation. Engine options include a 3.5L PFDi V6 producing 275 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 producing 310 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Diesel producing 121 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Transit's cargo capacity, ease of driving, and available technology.
