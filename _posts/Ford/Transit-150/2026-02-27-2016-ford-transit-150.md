### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford Transit-150 demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its intended commercial use. The gasoline engines, especially the 3.7L V6, tend to be less problematic than some of the more complex turbocharged or diesel options. The 3.5L EcoBoost can experience turbocharger and intake manifold issues, while the 3.2L Power Stroke diesel is more prone to DPF and EGR system problems, which are common in modern diesel powertrains. The automatic transmission is generally reliable but can exhibit harsh shifting or torque converter issues. Electrical gremlins like battery drain and sensor failures are not uncommon. Overall, with proper maintenance and attention to potential issues, the Transit-150 remains a capable and dependable work van.
