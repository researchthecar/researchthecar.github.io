**Summary**

The 2018 Ford Transit-150, while generally reliable, has some potential issues that buyers should be aware of. Engine issues with the 3.5L EcoBoost, specifically turbocharger failure, are potential problems for that engine option and can be expensive. The 3.2L diesel has some DPF issues that can cost upwards of a few thousand dollars to get repaired. Transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting and torque converter shudder, are common across all engine options and can range in cost depending on the severity. Other problems like sliding door issues, electrical problems, and rear suspension can also add to the cost of ownership.
