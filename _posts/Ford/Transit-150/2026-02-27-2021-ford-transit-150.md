### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Ford Transit-150 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 engine and standard chassis components.

Electrical gremlins, primarily concerning the infotainment system and battery drain, are also noted. While these issues can be costly to repair, they do not appear to be systemic across the entire model range. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate potential problems and ensure the longevity of the vehicle.
