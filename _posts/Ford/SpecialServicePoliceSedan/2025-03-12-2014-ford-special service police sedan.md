The 2014 Ford Special Service Police Sedan is a purpose-built vehicle designed for law enforcement use. It offered two engine options: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing around 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6, generating approximately 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the vehicle's robust build, spacious interior (especially the rear seat area designed for transporting individuals), and overall performance capabilities. Conversely, common complaints revolve around fuel economy, maintenance costs due to the heavy-duty nature of the vehicle, and some specific component failures.

**Engine**

**3.7L Ti-VCT V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, overheating, and a whining noise from the front of the engine. The water pump is internally mounted and driven by the timing chain, making replacement more complex.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump, often requiring significant labor due to its location.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

* **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining noise from the turbochargers, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and potential check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger(s). Sometimes both are replaced to ensure consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+ (per turbo, potentially more if both are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6F50)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. Transmission slipping, where the engine revs without corresponding acceleration.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may provide temporary relief. Valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild might be necessary for more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $150 - $300. Valve body replacement $800-$1500. Transmission rebuild $2500-$4500.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Reduced ride quality and handling, increased tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of rear coil springs or installation of air lift assist.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Spring replacement $400-$800. Air lift assist $200 - $500+ (including installation).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noise from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. Steering feels loose or vague.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected ball joint(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per ball joint.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery light illumination, dimming headlights, electrical system malfunctions, and difficulty starting the vehicle.

    *   Solution: Inspection and repair of the affected wiring harness. Replacement of damaged sections may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and location of the damage).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts, particularly in regions with road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Rust removal and application of protective coatings. In severe cases, welding or frame repair may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ (depending on the severity).

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Special Service Police Sedan, while a capable and robust vehicle, can be prone to certain issues, particularly given its demanding operational environment. Engine issues such as water pump failure on the 3.7L V6 and turbocharger issues on the 3.5L EcoBoost can be costly. Transmission problems, primarily harsh shifting and slipping, are also prevalent. Suspension issues, electrical problems, and interior wear are common complaints as well. Repair costs range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major component replacements like turbochargers or a transmission rebuild. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and condition before purchasing.
