### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ford Special Service Police Sedan is a capable and generally reliable platform designed for demanding use. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly with the cooling systems and, on turbocharged models, the turbochargers themselves. Transmission components like the torque converter can also require attention due to the high stress of police duty. Suspension wear is expected given the nature of the vehicle's operation, with control arms and shocks being common replacement items. Electrical systems, especially the alternator, can be a point of failure. While these issues are noted, they are often manageable with proper, specialized maintenance and timely repairs, ensuring the vehicle remains operational for its intended purpose.
