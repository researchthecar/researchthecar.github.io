The 2015 Ford Special Service Police Sedan (SSP) is a purpose-built vehicle designed for law enforcement use. It is based on the Ford Taurus platform but includes numerous heavy-duty components for increased durability and performance. Engine options for this model year include the 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 engine, producing around 288 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, as well as the more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine that delivers 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission across all engine options is a 6-speed automatic transmission (6F50). Owners and drivers appreciate the vehicle's spacious interior, robust suspension, and overall reliability in demanding conditions. However, common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs associated with the heavy-duty components, fuel economy, and the somewhat spartan interior compared to civilian vehicles.
