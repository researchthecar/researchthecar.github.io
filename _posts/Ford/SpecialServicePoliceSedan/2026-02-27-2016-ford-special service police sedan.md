### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford Special Service Police Sedan is a capable vehicle designed for demanding use. The most common areas for concern beyond routine maintenance are the engine and transmission, particularly with the EcoBoost variants, where turbocharger and internal component issues can arise. Suspension components, especially bushings and shocks, can wear faster than in civilian vehicles due to constant high-stress operation. Electrical issues like alternator failure and BCM glitches are also noted. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, proactive maintenance and inspection of the powertrain and suspension are recommended for optimal reliability in police service.
