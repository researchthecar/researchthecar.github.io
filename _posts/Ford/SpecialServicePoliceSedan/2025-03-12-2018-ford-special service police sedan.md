The 2018 Ford Special Service Police Sedan, based on the Taurus platform, offered a reliable and utilitarian option for law enforcement. Engine choices included a 3.5L V6, producing 288 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, as well as a 3.5L EcoBoost V6, which generated 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engine options were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the vehicle's spacious interior and comfortable ride, while common dislikes included its fuel economy and perceived bulkiness compared to more modern police vehicles.
