The 2016 Ford Special Service Police Sedan (SSP) is a variant of the Ford Taurus designed for law enforcement use. While it shares many components with the civilian Taurus, it features heavy-duty components and unique tuning for police work. Engine options included the 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 (288 hp, 254 lb-ft of torque) and the 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (365 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque), both paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (6F55). Common praises include its spacious interior and trunk, relatively comfortable ride, and available all-wheel drive. Common complaints include its size and weight, which can make it feel less agile than some competitors, and reported mechanical issues.
