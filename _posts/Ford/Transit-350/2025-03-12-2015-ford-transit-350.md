The 2015 Ford Transit-350 is a versatile van popular for commercial and personal use, offering a range of configurations to suit various needs. It was available with three engine options: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 (275 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (310 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.2L Power Stroke I5 Diesel (185 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (6R80). Owners appreciate the Transit-350's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and relatively good fuel economy compared to older van models. However, common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly electrical problems, and the van's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.
