**2015 Ford Transit-350**

The 2015 Ford Transit-350 is a full-size cargo van that offers a spacious interior, robust performance, and a range of engine and transmission options. It comes with two engine choices: a 3.7L V6 and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6, paired with either a 6-speed automatic transmission or a 10-speed automatic transmission. While the Transit-350 is praised for its hauling capabilities and versatility, some owners have reported various issues with the vehicle.

**Engine**

**3.7L V6**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** A faulty intake manifold gasket can cause coolant leaks, overheating, and reduced engine performance. Replacement of the gasket and associated parts is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Turbocharger Issues:** In some models, the turbocharger can fail prematurely, leading to reduced power and increased fuel consumption. Replacement of the turbocharger and related parts is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

* **Cam Phaser Failure:** Malfunctioning cam phasers can result in rough idling, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. Replacement of the cam phasers and timing components is typically required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Timing Chain Issues:** In certain models, the timing chain can stretch or break, leading to severe engine damage. Replacement of the timing chain and related components is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Problems:** Some owners have experienced hesitation, jerking, or harsh shifting during gear changes. A transmission fluid change, software update, or repair of a faulty valve body may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Torque Converter Failure:** A failing torque converter can cause shuddering, loss of power, and overheating. Replacement of the torque converter and associated parts is often required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**10-Speed Automatic**

* **Software Glitches:** The 10-speed automatic transmission can experience software glitches that lead to erratic shifting patterns, delayed gear engagements, and false neutral conditions. A software update typically resolves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
* **Slipping Gears:** In some cases, the transmission may slip gears or struggle to find the appropriate gear, resulting in reduced performance and fuel economy. A transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Wear:** Excessive wear on the front suspension components, such as ball joints or control arms, can cause loose steering, vibrations, and reduced handling. Replacement of the worn components is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Rear Spring Breakage:** In some models, the rear leaf springs can break prematurely, affecting ride quality and handling. Replacement of the leaf springs is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** A faulty electrical component, such as a parasitic draw, can drain the battery and lead to starting problems. Identifying and repairing the faulty component is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Electrical System Malfunctions:** Issues with the electrical system, such as faulty wiring or electronic control modules, can cause various electrical problems, including non-functional lights, power window failures, or dashboard malfunctions. Repairing or replacing the faulty components is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Body Panels:** Corrosion on the body panels, particularly around the wheel arches or lower rear area, can occur over time. Professional rust removal and repainting are necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
* **Door Lock Malfunctions:** In some models, the door locks may fail to operate properly, causing difficulty in locking or unlocking the doors. Replacement of the door lock actuators or switches may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Seat Belt Pretensioner Failure:** A malfunctioning seat belt pretensioner may not engage during a crash, increasing the risk of injury. Replacement of the pretensioner is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Climate Control Issues:** Problems with the climate control system, such as malfunctioning sensors or faulty actuators, can affect the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning functions. Repair or replacement of the faulty components is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
* **Infotainment System Glitches:** The infotainment system may experience software glitches or hardware failures, leading to issues such as Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation errors, or screen freezing. A software update or hardware repair may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford Transit-350 offers a range of features and capabilities, but some owners have encountered various issues with the vehicle. Common problems include engine failures, transmission issues, suspension wear, electrical malfunctions, corrosion, and interior component failures. The severity and cost of the issues can vary depending on the specific problem, engine and transmission option, and the condition of the vehicle. Regular maintenance and routine inspections are recommended to address potential issues early on and prevent major repairs or breakdowns.
