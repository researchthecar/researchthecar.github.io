### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Ford Transit-350 demonstrates solid reliability, particularly with its gasoline V6 engines. The 3.7L V6 and 3.5L EcoBoost are generally dependable, though common issues like cooling system leaks and, for the EcoBoost, turbocharger concerns can arise. The 2.0L EcoBlue diesel, while offering efficiency, is more prone to specific diesel-related issues such as DPF regeneration problems and AdBlue system faults, which can be costly to repair. Transmission reliability is good, with the 6-speed automatic occasionally exhibiting shifting issues. Suspension components like ball joints can wear over time, especially under heavy use. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon. Overall, the Transit-350 is a capable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential powertrain-specific issues, especially with the diesel variant, and budget for potential repairs.
