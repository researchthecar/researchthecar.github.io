### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Ford Transit-350 demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its chassis and exterior components. The most frequently reported issues tend to be concentrated in the powertrain, specifically with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and AdBlue systems on the EcoBlue diesel engine, and occasional turbocharger concerns on the EcoBoost V6. The 10-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are also noted but are not typically widespread.
