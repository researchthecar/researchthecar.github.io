The 2005 Ford Five Hundred was Ford's attempt to compete in the full-size sedan market. It was offered with a single engine choice, the 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 203 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options included a 6-speed Aisin automatic transmission on front-wheel drive (FWD) models and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) made by ZF on all-wheel drive (AWD) models. Owners generally appreciated the spacious interior, comfortable ride, and large trunk. Criticisms often focused on the underwhelming engine performance and the CVT transmission's feel.

**Engine**

**3.0L Duratec V6**

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn timing chains can cause rough running, misfires, and illuminated check engine light. This issue is more common in vehicles with neglected maintenance or high mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chains, tensioners, and guides.

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) (AWD Models)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, hesitation, loss of power, whining noises, or complete failure of the transmission. CVTs are known to be less durable than traditional automatics and prone to failure, especially with age and high mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CVT transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or after a short period of inactivity, requiring frequent jump-starts. This may be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the source of the parasitic draw and repair or replace the faulty component.

**Summary**

The 2005 Ford Five Hundred is a comfortable and spacious sedan, but it's important to be aware of its potential issues. The most serious concern is the reliability of the CVT transmission in AWD models, which can lead to expensive repairs. Other common issues like timing chain wear, suspension problems, and electrical faults can also contribute to maintenance costs. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, pay attention to any unusual noises or symptoms during a test drive, and be prepared for potential repairs, especially if the vehicle has high mileage.
