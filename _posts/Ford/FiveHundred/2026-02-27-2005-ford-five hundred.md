## Engine

### 3.0L Duratec 30 V6
**Variable Intake Manifold (VIM) Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Check Engine light illumination, rough idle, poor engine performance, P2004, P2005, P2006, P2007 DTCs.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the VIM actuator assembly or the entire intake manifold.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Coolant Leaks from Intake Manifold Gaskets**
- **Symptoms:** Visible coolant leaks, low coolant level, sweet smell of burning coolant, overheating.
- **Solution:** Replacement of intake manifold gaskets.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500


## Transmission

### Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) - ZF CFT30
**Transmission Shudder/Hesitation**
- **Symptoms:** Jerking, shuddering, or hesitation during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Transmission warning light may illuminate.
- **Solution:** Software update, transmission fluid flush and replacement, or in severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement.
- **Cost:** $500 - $3000+

**Transmission Fluid Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible fluid leaks under the vehicle, low transmission fluid level, potential for transmission damage if not addressed.
- **Solution:** Inspection and replacement of leaking seals or hoses.
- **Cost:** $200 - $600


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Struts/Shocks**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, clunking noises over bumps, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of struts and/or shocks.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

**Front Control Arm Bushing Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking or knocking noises from the front suspension, vague steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of front control arms or bushings.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Gremlins**
- **Symptoms:** Various electrical components malfunctioning intermittently (e.g., power windows, interior lights, door locks, dashboard lights).
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000+


### Alternator
**Premature Alternator Failure**

### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford Five Hundred offers a comfortable ride but is not without its potential reliability concerns. The most notable issues tend to revolve around the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), which can exhibit shuddering or hesitation, and the engine's Variable Intake Manifold (VIM) actuator. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the Body Control Module, and premature alternator failure are also reported. Suspension components like struts and control arm bushings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling issues. While exterior and interior components are generally robust, potential buyers should be aware of these common mechanical and electrical problem areas.
