The 2007 Ford Five Hundred is a full-size sedan that aimed to provide comfort and practicality. The sole engine option available for the 2007 model year was a 3.0L Duratec V6, producing 203 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with either a 6-speed Aisin automatic transmission for front-wheel-drive models or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for all-wheel-drive models. Owners generally appreciated the Five Hundred for its spacious interior and comfortable ride, especially on long trips. However, common complaints often revolved around the engine's perceived lack of power for the vehicle's size, as well as some reliability issues with the CVT transmission.
