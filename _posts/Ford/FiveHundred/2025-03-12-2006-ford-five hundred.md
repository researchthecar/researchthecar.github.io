The 2006 Ford Five Hundred was designed as a full-size sedan offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior. The sole engine option was a 3.0L Duratec V6 engine producing 203 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed Aisin F21 automatic transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciated the Five Hundred's roomy cabin, comfortable ride, and large trunk. Common complaints included the underwhelming engine performance for its size, the styling which some found bland, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.0L Duratec V6**
*   **Timing Chain Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can wear prematurely, leading to engine noise (rattling, especially on startup), poor performance, and potentially engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Ford Five Hundred, while offering a spacious interior and comfortable ride, suffers from several potential issues. Engine issues like timing chain wear and coil pack failures can be costly to address. The transmissions, especially the CVT, are prone to problems, which can lead to significant repair bills. Suspension and electrical gremlins add to the potential ownership costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major component failures. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, and budget accordingly for potential repairs, especially if considering a model with the CVT.
