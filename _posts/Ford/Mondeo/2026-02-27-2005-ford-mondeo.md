### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford Mondeo offers a practical and spacious option, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the diesel engines' turbochargers and dual-mass flywheels, and the automatic transmission's solenoids. Petrol engines, especially the 2.0L Duratec, tend to be more reliable. Suspension components like bushings can wear, and electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and central locking, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended, focusing on the powertrain and electrical systems.
