### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford Mondeo offers a generally competent ownership experience, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the diesel engines' turbochargers and the dual-mass flywheels. Petrol engines are more prone to ignition system faults and coolant leaks. Transmission reliability is mixed, with manual gearboxes generally being more robust than the automatics, which can suffer from leaks and torque converter problems. Suspension components like bushings and shocks are typical wear items. Electrical gremlins, especially concerning window regulators and central locking, are not uncommon. Rust can be a concern on older models, particularly in the wheel arches and sills. Overall, while not without its flaws, many issues are addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
