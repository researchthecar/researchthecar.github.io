### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford Mondeo offers a comfortable and practical driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with diesel engines. Turbocharger failures, injector problems, and dual-mass flywheel wear are notable concerns for the TDCi variants. Automatic transmissions can also develop leaks or torque converter issues. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and central locking, are not uncommon. While petrol engines and manual transmissions tend to be more robust, suspension components like bushings can wear over time. Careful inspection and consideration of these potential repair costs are advised when evaluating a used 2006 Mondeo.
