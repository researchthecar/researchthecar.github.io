### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford Mondeo presents a mixed reliability profile. Diesel variants, particularly the 2.0L TDCi, are more susceptible to issues related to the turbocharger, injectors, and dual-mass flywheel, which can be costly to repair. Petrol engines generally fare better, with fewer documented common faults. Transmission reliability is decent, though automatic gearboxes may experience fluid leaks or torque converter problems. Suspension components like wheel bearings and shock absorbers can require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and central locking, are not uncommon. Overall, while the Mondeo offers good value, potential buyers should be aware of the specific common faults, especially in diesel models, and factor in potential repair costs.
