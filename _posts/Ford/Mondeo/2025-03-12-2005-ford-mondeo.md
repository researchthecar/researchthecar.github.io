The 2005 Ford Mondeo, a mid-size car popular in Europe, offered a range of engine and transmission options. Let's consider the 2.0L Duratec petrol engine. This engine produces approximately 143 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. Drivers often praise the Mondeo for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and good handling. However, common complaints include electrical issues, certain engine problems, and some reliability concerns. Other engine options included the 1.8L and 2.5L petrol engines as well as 2.0L and 2.2L diesel engines. The vehicle was offered with both manual and automatic transmission options.
