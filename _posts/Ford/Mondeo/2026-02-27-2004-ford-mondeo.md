### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford Mondeo is a generally dependable vehicle, particularly with its petrol engines and manual transmissions. The diesel variants, especially the 2.0 TDCi, are more prone to specific issues like turbocharger and injector problems, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmissions may exhibit harsh shifting over time. Common wear items include suspension bushings and wheel bearings, which are typical for a car of this age and mileage. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument clusters, can also occur. Rust can be a concern on lower body panels. Overall, a well-maintained Mondeo can still offer good value, but potential buyers should be aware of these common fault areas, especially when considering diesel or automatic models.
