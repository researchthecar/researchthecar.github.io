### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford F-250, particularly with the gasoline Triton engines, is prone to spark plug blowout and camshaft synchronizer issues. The diesel 7.3L Power Stroke, while robust, can experience injector O-ring leaks and turbocharger problems. Automatic transmissions, specifically the 4R100, may develop torque converter clutch issues or overheat. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items on heavy-duty trucks. Electrical gremlins can manifest as instrument cluster or alternator failures. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior HVAC blower motors are a known failure point. Despite these potential issues, many F-250s remain reliable workhorses with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
