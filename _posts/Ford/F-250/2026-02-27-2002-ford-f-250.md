### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford F-250 is a capable heavy-duty truck, but like many vehicles of its era, it has known issues. The gasoline Triton V8 engines are susceptible to spark plug blowouts and camshaft sensor failures. The 7.3L Power Stroke diesel, while generally robust, can experience issues with ICP and EBP sensors. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4R100, may develop torque converter problems or overheat. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and instrument cluster problems are also reported. Rust can be a significant concern on the frame and body. Despite these potential drawbacks, many of these issues are well-documented and repairable, making the F-250 a viable option for those seeking a workhorse, provided maintenance history is considered.
