The 2005 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a popular work truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. Available engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the formidable 6.0L Power Stroke diesel V8. The 6.0L Power Stroke produced 325 horsepower and 560 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the truck's ability to handle heavy loads and its overall durability. However, common complaints revolve around the reliability of the 6.0L diesel engine, particularly issues with the EGR system and head gaskets, and the overall cost of maintaining a heavy-duty truck.

**Summary**

The 2005 Ford F-250 can be a capable and reliable truck, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those associated with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine. Head gasket failure, EGR cooler problems, and injector failures can lead to significant repair costs. While the 5.4L V8 and 6.8L V10 are generally more reliable, spark plug issues and cam phaser problems are worth noting. Suspension and electrical issues are also fairly common across the board. Overall, while some problems might be minor, the potential for major engine and transmission repairs makes a thorough inspection crucial before purchasing this truck. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls.
