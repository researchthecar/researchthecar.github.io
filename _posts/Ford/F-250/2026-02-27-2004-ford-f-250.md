### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford F-250, particularly models equipped with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, is known to have several significant reliability concerns that can be costly to repair. Issues such as EGR cooler failure, oil cooler failure, and head gasket problems are prevalent and require substantial investment. The gasoline engines, while generally more straightforward, can suffer from spark plug ejection and sensor issues. Transmission reliability is generally decent for the 4R100, but can overheat under heavy use. The manual ZF6 is more robust but clutch wear is a factor. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear, as expected for a heavy-duty truck. Electrical issues like alternator failure and instrument cluster problems are also reported. Rust can be a significant concern depending on the climate. Overall, while capable, the 2004 F-250 requires careful inspection and potentially significant maintenance, especially if opting for the 6.0L diesel.
