The 2008 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and payload capabilities. It was offered with three engine options: a 5.4L Triton V8 (300 hp, 365 lb-ft torque), a 6.8L Triton V10 (362 hp, 457 lb-ft torque), and the popular 6.4L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel (350 hp, 650 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 5-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. Owners often praise the F-250 for its ruggedness, towing capacity, and powerful diesel engine. Common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engines), some reliability issues (especially with the 6.4L diesel), and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**6.4L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR cooler cracks and leaks coolant, often resulting in white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and potentially overheating. A failed EGR cooler can also lead to carbon buildup in the intake manifold.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler. Consider upgrading to an aftermarket EGR cooler with improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, poor fuel economy, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). It is often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, no starting, stalling, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPOP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Lack of power, excessive black smoke, loud whistling noises, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The two-piece spark plugs are prone to breaking during removal. This can cause the spark plug to break off inside the head which will require a special tool to extract. This can be avoided by properly loosening the spark plugs prior to full removal of the plug.
    *   Solution: Use a special tool to extract the spark plug if it breaks. Consider switching to single-piece spark plugs for future replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ depending on number of broken spark plugs
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise coming from the engine, mostly at idle
    *   Solution: Replace the cam phasers and timing components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**
*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The two-piece spark plugs are prone to breaking during removal. This can cause the spark plug to break off inside the head which will require a special tool to extract. This can be avoided by properly loosening the spark plugs prior to full removal of the plug.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed TorqShift Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at highway speeds, slipping between gears, and transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, and transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive play in the steering, clunking noises from the front end, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the ball joints. It is often recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, poor ride quality, and potential spring failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty leaf springs for improved load carrying capacity.

**Summary**

The 2008 Ford F-250, particularly with the 6.4L Power Stroke diesel, can present several reliability challenges. Engine-related issues, such as EGR cooler failures, fuel injector problems, and turbocharger issues, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also add to the ownership costs. Suspension and electrical problems are common for vehicles of this age. Rust is also a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Potential buyers should carefully inspect any used F-250 and be prepared for potential maintenance and repair expenses. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs spanning from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
