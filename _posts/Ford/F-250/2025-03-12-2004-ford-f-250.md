The 2004 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a robust and capable work truck, highly regarded for its towing capacity and durability. The truck was available with a few engine options: the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The gas engines were available with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission, while the diesel engine was available with either a 5-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Some common praises for this truck include its solid build quality, powerful engine options (especially the diesel), and general ruggedness. However, the 2004 model year is particularly known for issues with the 6.0L Power Stroke Diesel engine, especially when compared to the older 7.3L Powerstroke and the newer 6.4L Powerstroke.

**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**
* 325 hp, 560 lb-ft of torque

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) cooler is prone to cracking, leading to coolant leaks into the exhaust system and potentially into the engine itself. This can cause white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and in severe cases, hydro-locking the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an updated design, or delete the EGR system completely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil cooler is located in the engine valley and is prone to clogging and leaking, resulting in reduced oil flow to the engine and potential overheating. It can also lead to coolant contamination.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler with an updated design or relocate the oil cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel injectors are susceptible to stiction (sticking), resulting in rough idling, misfires, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors. Using a fuel additive designed for diesel engines can also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cylinder head bolts are prone to stretching, leading to head gasket failure. This can cause coolant in the oil, white smoke, overheating, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replace the head gaskets and install stronger head studs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Variable Geometry Turbochargers (VGT) can experience sticking vanes causing surging, loss of power and/or overboost conditions.
    *   Solution: Clean, repair or replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**
* 300 hp, 365 lb-ft of torque

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 is known for its spark plugs breaking off during removal, due to the long thread design and corrosion.
    *   Solution: Use the correct removal procedure and specialized tools to remove the spark plugs. Some people opt to replace them with a single-piece design to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on if professional extraction is needed for broken plugs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body can experience wear and tear, resulting in harsh or erratic shifting.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic (Gasoline Engines Only)**
