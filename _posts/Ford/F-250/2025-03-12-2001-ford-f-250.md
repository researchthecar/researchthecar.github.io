The 2001 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse nature. Available engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8 (260 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp and 425 lb-ft of torque), and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the F-250's towing capacity and durability, but often cite issues with aging components and maintenance costs as downsides. The 7.3L Power Stroke is especially liked for its longevity but disliked for some of the repair costs, while the gas engines are liked for being cheaper to maintain but can have issues with power output.

**Summary**

The 2001 Ford F-250 Super Duty, while a capable and durable truck, is prone to issues associated with age. Engine issues, especially spark plug ejection in the gas engines and injector problems in the diesel, can be costly. Transmission problems, particularly shift flare and torque converter failure in the automatic, are also common concerns. Suspension and electrical issues can add to the maintenance burden. Rust is a prevalent cosmetic issue. The severity and cost of these repairs range from relatively minor fixes to major overhauls, potentially making ownership expensive depending on the vehicle's condition and maintenance history.
