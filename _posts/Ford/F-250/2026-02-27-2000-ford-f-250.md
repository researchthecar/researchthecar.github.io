- **Cost:** $300 - $600


### 6.8L Triton V10
**Spark Plug Blowout**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of power, rough idling, misfires, audible popping sound from engine.
- **Solution:** Requires specialized tools to extract broken spark plug and re-tap cylinder head. Often involves replacing spark plugs with updated versions.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

**Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Coolant leaks, engine overheating, rough idle, check engine light.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


### 7.3L Power Stroke Diesel
**Injector Control Pressure (ICP) Sensor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Hard starting, stalling, rough running, no-start condition.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the ICP sensor.
- **Cost:** $150 - $300

**Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP) Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Stalling, rough running, no-start condition, especially when hot.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the CMP sensor.
- **Cost:** $100 - $250


## Transmission

### 4R100 Automatic Transmission
**Torque Converter Issues**

- **Cost:** $1200 - $2500

**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission fluid smells burnt, delayed shifts, slipping.
- **Solution:** Installation of an auxiliary transmission cooler, fluid and filter change.
- **Cost:** $200 - $500


### 5-Speed Manual Transmission
**No Major Issues**
- **Symptoms:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Solution:** No widespread issues reported.
- **Cost:** No widespread issues reported.


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Ball Joint Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises, uneven tire wear, steering wander.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Leaf Spring Sagging**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced rear ride height, poor handling under load.
- **Solution:** Replacement of sagging leaf springs.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Ford F-250 is a capable truck, but its age means certain components are more prone to failure. The gasoline Triton V8 engines (5.4L and 6.8L) are known for spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks. The 7.3L Power Stroke diesel, while generally robust, can experience issues with its ICP and CMP sensors. Automatic transmission (4R100) concerns often revolve around torque converter problems and overheating, necessitating robust cooling solutions. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items on heavy-duty trucks. Electrical issues, particularly alternator failure and wiring corrosion, are also noted. Exterior rust is a significant concern for trucks in corrosive environments. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and door lock actuators are the most frequently reported failures. Regular inspections and proactive maintenance, especially addressing potential rust and fluid health, are crucial for maintaining the reliability of this generation of F-250.
