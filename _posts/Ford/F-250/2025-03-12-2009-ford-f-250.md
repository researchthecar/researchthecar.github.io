Engine issues, particularly with the 6.4L Power Stroke diesel (EGR cooler, HPOP, Injectors) and the 5.4L Triton V8 (Spark Plug Thread Failure, Roller Follower Failure), can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission problems with the 5R110W TorqShift (Torque Converter Failure, Valve Body Issues) are also a concern. Suspension (Ball Joint, Leaf Spring) and electrical (Alternator, Instrument Cluster, Trailer Light) issues can add to the overall cost of ownership. Rust on the undercarriage and cab corners is a prevalent issue, especially in regions with harsh winters. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely depending on the truck's maintenance history and usage.
