The 2002 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its ruggedness and workhorse capabilities. Engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 5.4L V8 produced around 260 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions were generally a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual, depending on the engine and trim. Owners often appreciate the F-250's towing capacity and robust build. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, especially with the larger engines, and the age-related issues that naturally arise in a vehicle of this vintage.

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford F-250, while a robust and capable truck, is subject to age-related issues. Common engine problems include spark plug ejection (especially in the 5.4L and 6.8L engines), injector issues in the 7.3L Diesel, and exhaust manifold leaks. Transmission issues range from torque converter problems in the automatic to clutch and synchro wear in the manual. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also prone to wear. Electrical problems, such as instrument cluster malfunctions and alternator failures, can occur. Frame and body rust are also concerns, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand for major repairs like engine or transmission rebuilds. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to significant drivability problems, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2002 F-250.
