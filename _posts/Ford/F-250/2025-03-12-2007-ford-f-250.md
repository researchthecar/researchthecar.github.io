The 2007 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the powerful 6.0L Power Stroke Diesel V8. The 5.4L V8 produced around 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were primarily a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often praise the F-250 for its ruggedness, spacious cabin, and ability to handle tough jobs, while common complaints include fuel economy, ride quality, and potential issues with certain engine components, especially the 6.0L diesel.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, potential engine overheating. The EGR cooler is prone to cracking and leaking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler, often with an aftermarket upgraded version. Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil in the coolant, or coolant in the oil. Overheating can also be a symptom. The oil cooler is prone to leaking.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil cooler. Thorough flushing of the cooling system is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, white or black smoke from the exhaust, reduced power, poor fuel economy. Injectors can fail due to stiction or contamination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injectors. Proper diagnosis is crucial to identify the specific injectors that are failing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per injector (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, especially at lower speeds. Can lead to complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. May also require flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, erratic shifting behavior.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body. May also require flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load-carrying capacity, rough ride. Leaf springs can weaken or break over time, especially with heavy use.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs may be considered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front end, especially when turning or going over bumps. Loose steering, uneven tire wear. Ball joints are a common wear item.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford F-250, while a capable truck, has several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The 6.0L Power Stroke Diesel is known for significant engine problems like EGR cooler, oil cooler, and FICM failures, which can be costly to repair. The 5.4L Triton V8 engine has spark plug issues and cam phaser problems, while the 6.8L Triton V10 engine has issues with the exhaust manifold bolts. The 5R110W transmission can suffer from torque converter and valve body failures. Other issues include suspension problems like leaf spring sagging and electrical problems, such as alternator failure. Cab corner rust is a common exterior concern. Potential owners should carefully inspect the vehicle and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems. The severity and cost of these issues range from relatively minor repairs to major overhauls, making it crucial to factor in potential maintenance costs when considering a 2007 F-250.
