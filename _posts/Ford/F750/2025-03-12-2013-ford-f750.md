Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2013 Ford F-750, organized by category and engine/transmission option. This information is based on publicly available information such as owner forums, repair databases, and recall notices. Note that due to the nature of commercial vehicles and their varied uses, pinpointing failure rates can be challenging.

The 2013 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty commercial truck, designed for a wide range of vocational applications. Engine options included the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel, producing around 300-330 horsepower and 725 lb-ft of torque (depending on specific tuning). A gasoline V10 was also available as an option. Transmission options were typically a Ford 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the F-750's robust build and towing capacity. Common dislikes revolve around fuel economy, maintenance costs, and the general stiffness of the ride due to its heavy-duty nature.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the turbo, loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect and clean or replace any related components, such as oil lines and air filters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and black or white smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace. Recalibrate the fuel system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, warning lights on the dashboard, loss of power, and eventually, a clogged DPF leading to engine shutdown.
    *   Solution: Attempt manual regeneration. If unsuccessful, the DPF may need to be cleaned or replaced. Address any underlying issues causing excessive soot buildup (e.g., faulty injectors).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (cleaning) - $3,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Gasoline V10**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and reduced power. The V10 engine family was known for spark plug issues, where the spark plugs would break off inside the cylinder head during removal or operation.
    *   Solution: Remove the broken spark plug (special tools may be required). Replace with updated spark plugs and follow proper torque specifications.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity and any damage to the cylinder head)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 6-Speed Automatic (TorqShift)**

*   **Shift Flare**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A momentary increase in engine RPMs during gear changes, especially between specific gears.
    *   Solution: Software update, valve body replacement, or full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (software update) - $4,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, difficulty engaging gears, and potential transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Inspect the transmission for any damage caused by the failed converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, rough ride, and potential cracking or breaking of leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the damaged leaf springs. Inspect and replace any worn bushings or hardware.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the number of springs needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shocks or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights, erratic engine performance, and transmission shifting issues. Common culprits include wheel speed sensors, crank/cam position sensors, and mass airflow sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor(s) and replace.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights not working, gauges malfunctioning, and starting problems. Often caused by corrosion or damaged wiring.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the damaged wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity and location of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found
