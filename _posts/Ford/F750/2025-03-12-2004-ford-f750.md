The 2004 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications, offering a robust platform for various vocational needs. It's generally appreciated for its dependability, workhorse capabilities, and relative ease of maintenance compared to some of its contemporaries. However, like any vehicle of this age and class, the 2004 F-750 is susceptible to certain issues. Available engines include the Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine producing approximately 300 horsepower and around 860 lb-ft of torque, the Cummins ISB diesel engine with similar output, and the Ford 7.3L Powerstroke diesel engine with similar output. Transmission options include the Allison automatic transmissions, the Eaton Fuller manual transmissions, and the Ford TorqShift transmission. Owners often find the cab comfortable for its class, but some dislike the truck's relatively large turning radius.

**Engine**

**Summary**
The 2004 Ford F-750, while a dependable workhorse, can present several potential issues primarily related to its diesel engines and transmissions, especially given its age. Engine-related problems such as injector failure, HEUI pump issues (for the Caterpillar 3126), CPS failure (for the 7.3L Powerstroke), and turbocharger problems can be costly, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Transmission issues, including torque converter failure and valve body problems, also contribute to potential significant repair costs. Suspension and electrical problems are also common due to the vehicle's age. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, such as replacing the CPS sensor or repairing minor wiring issues, major repairs such as replacing injectors or rebuilding the transmission can be substantial expenses. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major operational disruptions, making thorough inspection and regular maintenance essential for maintaining the vehicle's reliability.
