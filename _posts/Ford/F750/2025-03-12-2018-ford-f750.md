The 2018 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications, offering a robust chassis and a variety of configurations to suit different needs. Engine options for the 2018 F-750 typically include a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel and a 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel produces around 270-330 horsepower and 700-750 lb-ft of torque, depending on the specific tuning. The 6.8L Triton V10 produces around 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. The transmission option is typically a Ford TorqShift 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the F-750's heavy-duty capabilities, customizable configurations, and overall reliability for demanding tasks. However, some common dislikes include the relatively basic interior, potential for higher running costs due to its size and fuel consumption, and occasional issues related to the diesel engine's emissions systems.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, black smoke from exhaust, decreased fuel economy, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector depending on labor and shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, decreased engine performance, check engine light, possible "limp mode". Can be caused by sensor failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the DPF issue (often a faulty sensor). Replace the sensor or DPF if necessary. Force a manual regeneration if the DPF is clogged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Sensor replacement $200 - $500, DPF replacement $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on the part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor acceleration, black smoke from exhaust, check engine light.
    * Solution: Replace the EGR valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10 Gasoline**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden loss of power, loud popping noise from the engine bay, check engine light. The spark plugs may eject from the cylinder head due to weakened threads.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head if the threads are damaged. Install new spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the severity of the damage and if head replacement is necessary.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially when cold, exhaust leak, decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Remove broken bolts and replace them. Sometimes requires drilling and extraction of broken bolts. Replacing the manifold is also a common fix, especially if warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the number of bolts broken and the shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, especially between certain gears.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. Perform a transmission flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis and repair of internal components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change $150 - $300, internal repairs $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revs higher than normal without corresponding acceleration, delayed engagement of gears.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is burnt or low, there may be internal damage requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ for rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
