The 2003 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications like construction, delivery, and utility work. It offers robust capabilities and a durable chassis. Engine options included the Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine and the Cummins ISB diesel engine. The 3126 produces roughly 300 horsepower and 860 lb-ft of torque. The Cummins ISB produces roughly 275 horsepower and 660 lb-ft of torque. Common complaints often center around the higher running costs associated with commercial vehicles (fuel, maintenance). Positive aspects typically involve its reliability, workhorse capabilities, and suitability for heavy-duty tasks. Owners often dislike the stiff ride and utilitarian interior.

**Engine**

**Caterpillar 3126**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, rough idling, excessive smoke, and decreased power.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure even fuel delivery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor rates)

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford F-750 is generally a reliable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential issues common to medium-duty trucks. Engine-related problems (especially with the Caterpillar 3126, such as injector issues) can be expensive. Suspension and electrical issues are also relatively common and can lead to costly repairs. Rust is a concern, especially in regions where road salt is used. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, especially the engine, suspension, and electrical system, and be prepared for higher maintenance costs compared to lighter-duty trucks.
