        * Solution: Replace the EGR valve.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

* **7.3L Power Stroke Diesel**
    * **Injection Pump Failure:** The injection pump fails, resulting in engine stalling, rough idling, and reduced power.
        * Solution: Replace the injection pump.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

* **5.4L Triton V8**
    * **Spark Plug Failure:** The spark plugs wear out prematurely, causing misfires, reduced engine power, and poor fuel economy.
        * Solution: Replace the spark plugs.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

**Transmission**

* **5-Speed Automatic (TorqShift)**
    * **Slipping Gears:** The transmission slips out of gear while driving, causing loss of power and potential accidents.

        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * **Torque Converter Shudder:** The torque converter shudders during acceleration, resulting in an uncomfortable ride and potential transmission damage.
        * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
        * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,000+

* **6-Speed Automatic (TorqShift)**
    * **Overheating:** The transmission overheats during heavy towing or off-roading, potentially causing internal damage.
