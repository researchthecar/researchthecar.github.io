Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2022 Ford F-750, organized by category and component.

The 2022 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications. It is known for its robust chassis and versatility. Common engine options include the 7.3L V8 gas engine, producing 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine, which generates 270-330 horsepower and 700-750 lb-ft of torque, depending on the configuration. Both engines are paired with a Ford TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the F-750's heavy-duty capabilities and customizability, but some find the ride quality and fuel economy to be drawbacks. Due to its commercial nature, reported issues tend to focus on reliability and durability.

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford F-750, while a capable commercial vehicle, exhibits a range of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with fuel injectors and DPF systems in the diesel variant, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting and slipping, are also common concerns. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are prone to wear and tear, impacting ride quality and load-carrying capacity. Electrical problems and HVAC malfunctions can further contribute to maintenance costs. The severity and cost of repairs can vary, but addressing these issues promptly is crucial to maintaining the vehicle's reliability and longevity. Due to the commercial nature of the vehicle, higher mileage and usage may exacerbate these issues.
