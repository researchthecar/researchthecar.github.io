The 2012 Ford F-750 is a heavy-duty commercial truck designed for various vocational applications. Engine options included the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel V8, producing around 300-325 horsepower and 660-750 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were typically various Allison automatic transmissions, depending on the specific application. Owners often appreciate the F-750 for its robust build, towing capacity, and suitability for demanding jobs. Common dislikes include fuel economy, maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty vehicles, and general maneuverability in tight spaces due to its size.

**Summary**
The 2012 Ford F-750 can experience a range of issues, particularly related to the engine, transmission, and suspension components given its heavy-duty nature. Diesel engine components like fuel injectors, the DPF, and EGR valve are prone to failures. Transmission slippage and harsh shifting, and torque converter failure are common issues as well. Suspension components like leaf springs and bushings are prone to wear and tear. These issues can range from moderate to severe in terms of impact and can require significant repair costs, particularly with the engine and transmission related repairs. Rust and corrosion are also a concern in certain climates.
