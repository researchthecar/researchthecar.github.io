**Introduction:**

The 2010 Ford F750 is a heavy-duty pickup truck designed for commercial use. It's available with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive and a choice of two engines: a 6.4L V8 diesel engine and a 6.8L V10 gasoline engine. Both engines are mated to a TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. The F750 offers impressive towing and payload capacities, making it a popular choice for construction, towing, and hauling applications. However, like all vehicles, the F750 has certain issues that owners have reported.

**Engine**

**6.4L V8 Diesel Engine:**

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues:**
    * Description/Symptoms: The DPF is responsible for filtering out soot and ash from the exhaust system. Over time, the DPF can become clogged, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and the "DPF Full" warning light on the dashboard.
    * Solution: The DPF can be cleaned or replaced. Cleaning costs around $500-$1,000, while a replacement can cost $1,500-$2,500+.
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Turbocharger Failure:**
    * Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger helps boost engine power. Failure of the turbocharger can cause a loss of power, smoke from the exhaust, and increased fuel consumption.
    * Solution: The turbocharger may need to be replaced. The cost to replace the turbocharger is typically between $1,200-$2,000+ for parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found
