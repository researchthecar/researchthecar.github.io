The 2006 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications, praised for its robust build, towing capacity, and versatility. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The available engines for the 2006 F-750 included the Cummins ISB 5.9L inline-six diesel engine, producing around 200-325 horsepower and 520-610 lb-ft of torque depending on the specific tuning. The Cummins ISC 8.3L inline-six diesel engine, producing around 240-350 horsepower and 660-1050 lb-ft of torque, and the Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine, producing around 175-330 horsepower and 420-860 lb-ft of torque. Common transmissions include the Allison 1000, 2000, and 3000 series automatics and various manual transmissions depending on the application and engine choice. Owners appreciate the truck's reliability and workhorse capabilities, but some express concerns about fuel economy, maintenance costs, and potential issues related to the diesel particulate filter (DPF) systems in later production models.

**Summary**

The 2006 Ford F-750, while a capable workhorse, can be subject to a variety of issues stemming from its robust diesel engines, heavy-duty transmission, and the wear and tear associated with commercial use. The most concerning issues relate to the engine, particularly the Cummins ISB 5.9L, Cummins ISC 8.3L, and Caterpillar 3126 engines. The Allison transmissions can also suffer from shift quality and slipping issues, potentially leading to costly rebuilds. Suspension and electrical issues, while less severe, can still cause significant downtime and maintenance expenses. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic experienced with medium-duty trucks.
