The 6.7L Power Stroke® V8 turbo diesel engine delivers 440 horsepower and 925 lb-ft of torque, while the 6.2L V8 gas engine produces 385 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic and a 10-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the F750's towing and hauling capabilities, spacious cabin, and advanced technology, but some have encountered various issues.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke® V8**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** Turbocharger failure can lead to reduced power, loss of boost, and a whistling or whining noise. Turbocharger replacement is necessary, typically costing $2,000 - $4,000+.
* **Fuel Injector Malfunction:** Faulty fuel injectors can result in poor fuel economy, rough idle, and engine hesitation. Fuel injector replacement may be needed, with an estimated cost between $400 - $800 per injector plus labor.

**6.2L V8**

* **Timing Chain Noise:** Excessive noise from the timing chain can indicate wear or damage. Timing chain replacement involves removing the engine front cover and adjusting or replacing the timing components, costing approximately $1,500 - $2,500.
* **Intake Manifold Leakage:** Intake manifold leaks can cause rough idling, reduced power, and increased emissions. Replacement of the intake manifold is typically needed, ranging from $1,000 - $2,000.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** Vibration or shuddering during acceleration or shifting can be caused by a faulty torque converter. Torque converter replacement with labor can be costly, ranging from $2,000 - $4,000.

**Suspension**

* **Rear Leaf Spring Failure:** Heavy loads or rough terrain can cause rear leaf springs to break or sag, leading to uneven ride height, vibrations, and handling issues. Replacing rear leaf springs costs around $500 - $1,000 per side.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** Various electrical components, such as the alternator or parasitic drain, can cause premature battery discharge. Troubleshooting and repair of electrical issues typically requires a mechanic's assistance, with costs varying depending on the cause.
* **Headlight Malfunction:** Headlights may flicker, dim, or fail due to faulty bulbs, wiring, or control modules. Repair costs range from $100 - $500+, depending on the specific issue.

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Latch Failure:** Tailgate latches can become stuck or broken, preventing the tailgate from closing securely. Replacing the tailgate latch assembly typically costs around $200 - $400.

* **Climate Control System Failure:** Malfunctioning actuators or other components can lead to issues with temperature control, airflow, or defrosting. Repair costs depend on the specific fault but can exceed $1,000 in some cases.

**Summary:**

Overall, the 2017 Ford F750 Super Duty has received positive reviews, but it has been subject to several common issues. Engine problems, such as turbocharger failure and fuel injector malfunctions, can be costly to repair. Similarly, transmission issues like torque converter shudder can lead to significant expenses. Suspension problems, such as rear leaf spring failure, are also not uncommon. Electrical issues, including battery drain and headlight malfunctions, may require expert diagnosis and repair. Additionally, certain interior features, such as the rearview camera display and climate control system, have been reported to experience failures. The severity and cost of these issues should be considered when purchasing or maintaining a 2017 Ford F750 Super Duty.
