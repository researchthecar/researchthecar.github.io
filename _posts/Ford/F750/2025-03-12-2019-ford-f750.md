Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Ford F-750, organized by category and engine/transmission option. The 2019 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial purposes. Available engines include a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine, producing 330 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque. A 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine was also available. Transmission options were typically either a Ford TorqShift 6-speed automatic or an Allison transmission depending on configuration. Owners often appreciate the F-750's robust build and towing capacity, but some dislike its fuel economy and higher operating costs.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, reduced power, and difficulty starting. Can be caused by contaminated fuel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). Requires diagnosis to identify the specific injector(s) causing the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per injector, depending on labor rates and whether you replace one or all.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, "Exhaust Filter Full" message on the dashboard, reduced engine power, and potential engine damage if ignored.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF by a technician, cleaning the DPF, or replacement of the DPF if it is severely clogged or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (forced regeneration) - $3000+ (DPF replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noises from the engine, loss of power, excessive black smoke, and potential for complete engine failure if the turbocharger disintegrates.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. It's critical to diagnose the root cause of the failure (e.g., oil starvation, debris ingestion) to prevent repeat failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10 Gasoline**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A sudden loud popping noise from the engine, followed by a severe misfire and loss of power. Often caused by stripped spark plug threads in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the cylinder head to properly secure the spark plugs. Options include using thread repair inserts or replacing the entire cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noise from the engine, especially when cold, which may lessen as the engine warms up. Reduced fuel economy and potential for exhaust fumes entering the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold gasket or the manifold itself if it is warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable clunking or jerking during gear changes, delayed engagement, or the transmission slipping out of gear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking the transmission fluid level and condition, inspecting solenoids, valve body, and potentially rebuilding or replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) - $5000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. May also cause stalling when coming to a stop.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. It's often recommended to flush the transmission and replace the filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Allison Transmission**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Rough ride, poor handling, and potential for the spring to break.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf spring(s). Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring, depending on the type and whether it's installed on one or both sides.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and reduced braking performance. Uneven tire wear can also result from worn shocks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the shocks/struts. Replacing them in pairs is recommended for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per pair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery repeatedly dies, especially overnight or after sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw. Common causes include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a malfunctioning charging system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS, TPMS, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard, incorrect readings, and potential for the affected system to malfunction.
    *   Solution: Identify and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on the location and type of sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially in areas prone to salt exposure (e.g., undercarriage, wheel wells, body seams).
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, priming, and painting. Application of rust inhibitors or undercoating can help prevent future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+, depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Issues**

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford F-750 is a workhorse, but like any commercial vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The most serious issues revolve around the diesel engine (fuel injectors, DPF, turbocharger) and transmission (harsh shifting, torque converter issues), with potentially high repair costs. Electrical and suspension problems are also common. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential maintenance costs when considering a purchase.
