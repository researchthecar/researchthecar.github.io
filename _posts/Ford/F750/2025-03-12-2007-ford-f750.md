The 2007 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty commercial truck known for its robustness and versatility. It was available with a Cummins ISB 6.7L diesel engine rated around 325 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque and a Caterpillar C7 diesel engine rated around 300 horsepower and 860 lb-ft of torque. The typical transmission options included Allison automatic transmissions. Owners generally appreciate the F-750's workhorse capabilities and its ability to be upfitted for a wide variety of applications. Common dislikes often revolve around fuel economy, ride quality, and the increased maintenance costs associated with commercial-grade vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford F-750, while a capable truck, can be prone to issues typical of medium-duty commercial vehicles. Engine problems, particularly those involving fuel injectors or the HEUI pump (Caterpillar C7), can be costly. Transmission issues related to shift solenoids or the torque converter are also common. Suspension and electrical gremlins can also appear. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in areas with road salt usage. While not all vehicles will experience these issues, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and factor in potential maintenance costs. The severity and cost of these repairs can range from a few hundred to several thousands of dollars, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection crucial.
