The 2017 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications, offering robust capabilities and versatility. Engine options for this model year include the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel, producing 270-330 horsepower and 700-750 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine, generating 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. The 6.7L Power Stroke Diesel is typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.8L V10 gasoline engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the F-750's ability to handle heavy workloads and its customizable chassis. Common complaints typically revolve around fuel economy, maintenance costs associated with a commercial vehicle, and the overall size, which can make maneuvering in tight spaces challenging.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, black smoke, and decreased fuel economy. May trigger diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel injection.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per injector (labor and parts).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, and the "check engine" light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration by a technician, cleaning of the DPF, or replacement if severely damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 for cleaning, $2000 - $4000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10 Gasoline**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, decreased fuel economy, and hesitation during acceleration. The 2-valve engine is more prone to ejection of spark plugs from the cylinder head due to stripped threads.
    *   Solution: Install thread repair inserts or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2000, depending on the repair method and extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Applicable to Both Engines)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Could indicate low fluid, worn clutches, or a faulty solenoid pack. Replacing the solenoid pack and fluid flush might solve the issue. More extensive repairs may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 for solenoid pack/fluid, $3000 - $7000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various warning lights on the dashboard, including ABS, traction control, or engine management lights. This can be caused by failed wheel speed sensors, oxygen sensors, or other critical sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific failed sensor using a diagnostic tool and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on location and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, such as lights flickering, sensors malfunctioning, or starting issues. This can be caused by corroded or damaged wiring harnesses.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the damaged wiring harness section.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the extent of the damage and accessibility.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the frame, body panels, or other metal components, especially in regions with road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Treat rust with rust converter, repair/replace affected panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5000+, depending on the extent of the corrosion damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heating or air conditioning system may blow warm air when it should be cold or vice-versa. This can be caused by a faulty blend door actuator, refrigerant leaks, or a failing compressor.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue and replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford F-750, while a capable commercial vehicle, can experience a range of issues. Engine problems such as fuel injector failure, DPF clogging, and spark plug issues in the 6.8L V10 can be costly. Transmission shifting problems also pose a significant expense. Electrical sensor failures and wiring harness issues can further contribute to maintenance costs. Owners should be aware of potential corrosion issues, particularly in areas with heavy salt use. Overall, while most of these issues are typical of commercial vehicles, the potential repair costs can be high, so it is best to have a mechanic inspect the car before buying it.
