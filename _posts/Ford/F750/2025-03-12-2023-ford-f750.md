    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 for forced regeneration; $1,500 - $3,500+ for DPF replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased fuel economy, check engine light. The EGR valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits, leading to malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8 Gasoline**

    *   Solution: Inspection and potential replacement of faulty valve train components (lifters, rockers, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable drop in oil level between oil changes. Excessive oil consumption can indicate potential engine problems.
    *   Solution: Thorough engine inspection to identify the source of oil consumption (e.g., worn piston rings, valve seals). Repair or replace affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly when cold.
