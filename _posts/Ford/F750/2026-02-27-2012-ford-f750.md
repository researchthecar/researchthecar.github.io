### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford F-750 is a capable commercial vehicle with a generally solid reliability record, particularly when equipped with the Cummins diesel engines. The most common non-wear-related issues tend to be related to the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system and fuel injectors on the Power Stroke engine, and fuel pump issues on the Cummins. Transmission issues, while not widespread, can be costly to repair, especially for automatics. Suspension components like leaf springs are robust but can fail under extreme stress or age. Electrical issues are typically minor, with alternator failure being a notable concern. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the F-750 can provide dependable service for its intended heavy-duty applications.
