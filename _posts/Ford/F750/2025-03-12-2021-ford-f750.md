The 2021 Ford F-750 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications, offering a blend of power and capability. A popular engine choice is the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel, producing 330 horsepower and 725 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the 7.3L V8 gas engine and a CNG/Propane capable 6.8L V10 gas engine. Transmission options include a TorqShift HD 6-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the F-750's robust build and towing capacity, but some dislike its fuel economy and maneuverability in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, decreased fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust. Often caused by contaminated fuel.
    * Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. Thoroughly flush the fuel system and replace the fuel filter to prevent recurrence.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, reduced engine power, and the "check engine" light illuminating. Can be caused by excessive idling or short trips that don't allow the DPF to fully regenerate.
    * Solution: Perform a forced regeneration. In severe cases, the DPF may need to be cleaned or replaced. Consider adjusting driving habits to allow for complete regeneration cycles.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**7.3L V8 Gas Engine**

* **Valve Train Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noise, especially at startup. May be related to valve lash adjustment or wear in the valve train components.
    * Solution: Adjust valve lash or replace worn components such as lifters or rocker arms.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.8L V10 Gas Engine**

*No issues found*

**Transmission**

**TorqShift HD 6-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, and difficulty engaging gears.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission service, including fluid and filter replacement. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be required to identify internal damage, such as worn clutch packs or valve body issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+ for service, $1500 - $4000+ for rebuild/replacement
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, reduced ride height, and decreased load-carrying capacity. Common in vehicles frequently used for heavy hauling.
    * Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is regularly used for heavy loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ per axle
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sensor Failures**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination, drivability issues, and fault codes related to various sensors (e.g., mass airflow sensor, oxygen sensors, etc.).
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor causing the issue and replace it. Ensure proper wiring and connections.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic behavior of electrical components such as lights, windows, or door locks. May also cause issues with remote keyless entry.
    * Solution: Diagnose the BCM. Reprogramming or replacement may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Corrosion on Undercarriage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on frame, axles, and other undercarriage components. More prevalent in regions with harsh winters or coastal environments.
    * Solution: Apply rust inhibitor or undercoating to protect the undercarriage. Remove existing rust and repair any damaged areas.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ for treatment, $1000+ for repairs
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Blower motor not working, weak airflow, or unusual noises from the blower motor area.
    * Solution: Replace the blower motor. Also, inspect the blower motor resistor or control module, as it may also be faulty.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford F-750, particularly with the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, can experience issues related to fuel injectors and the DPF, potentially leading to drivability problems and repair costs ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars. The 6-speed automatic transmission can suffer from harsh shifting, potentially requiring expensive repairs. Other common issues include suspension sagging, electrical sensor failures, and undercarriage corrosion. The severity of these problems varies, but owners should be aware of these potential issues when considering a 2021 F-750.
