The 2004 Ford Escape was a popular compact SUV offering a blend of practicality, affordability, and decent fuel economy for its time. Engine options included a 2.0L Zetec inline-4 producing 127 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, a 2.3L Duratec inline-4 with 153 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duratec V6 generating 200 horsepower and 193 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual (primarily with the 4-cylinder engines) and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Escape for its car-like handling, comfortable ride, and spacious interior for its class. However, common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly concerning the automatic transmission, and some found the fuel economy of the V6 engine underwhelming.
