Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Ford Escape, categorized by component, engine/transmission option, with descriptions, solutions, estimated costs, and recall information. The 2022 Ford Escape is a compact SUV offering a variety of powertrains, including a 1.5L EcoBoost I3 (181 hp, 190 lb-ft torque), a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 (250 hp, 280 lb-ft torque), a 2.5L I4 Hybrid (200 hp combined), and a 2.5L I4 Plug-in Hybrid (221 hp combined). The 1.5L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid models use an eCVT. Owners often praise the Escape's fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and available technology. Common dislikes include the sometimes sluggish acceleration with the base engine and the confusing infotainment system for some users.

**Engine**

**1.5L EcoBoost I3**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, shaking, check engine light illuminated, loss of power. Often caused by coolant intrusion into the cylinders due to a cracked cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head and potentially other damaged components such as spark plugs or ignition coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (due to the complexity of the repair and potential for further engine damage)
    *   Recalls: 22V-687: Certain 1.5L engines may experience an engine oil separator failure that allows oil to enter the intake manifold and potentially cause an engine fire.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil warning light illuminated frequently, needing to add oil between scheduled oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the PCM can help manage oil consumption. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement or engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (PCM Update) to $4,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining noise from the engine, check engine light.

**Summary:**

The 2022 Ford Escape has a range of potential issues. The most significant ones involve engine problems, particularly with the 1.5L EcoBoost engine (misfires, oil consumption) and the 2.5L Plug-in Hybrid high voltage battery. These issues can be expensive to repair, potentially costing thousands of dollars. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and backup camera are also relatively common. While the hybrid models have fewer engine-related problems, they can experience stalling issues or battery coolant leaks that require software updates or part replacements. Overall, a thorough inspection and maintenance history check are recommended before purchasing a used 2022 Ford Escape, particularly one equipped with the 1.5L EcoBoost engine or the Plug-in Hybrid powertrain.
