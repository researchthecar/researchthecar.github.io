### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford Escape presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential issues with cooling systems, particularly the fan motor on the 2.3L engine, and VVT solenoids on the 3.0L V6. Transmission fluid leaks and torque converter problems can also arise. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items that may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as failing window regulators and instrument clusters, are also documented. Exterior issues are less common, with the rear hatch latch being a notable point. Interior comfort can be affected by HVAC blower motor resistor failures. Overall, with diligent maintenance and attention to these specific problem areas, the 2007 Escape can remain a dependable vehicle.
