The 2019 Ford Escape represents the final year of the third generation, offering a blend of practicality and comfort that made it a popular choice for families and commuters. Available engine options include a 2.5L Duratec I4 (168 hp, 170 lb-ft of torque), a 1.5L EcoBoost I4 (179 hp, 177 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 (245 hp, 275 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Escape for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly technology. Common complaints include the relatively dated styling compared to newer competitors, some reliability concerns (especially with the EcoBoost engines), and fuel economy that doesn't always meet expectations.

**Engine**

**2.5L Duratec I4**

*   **No Known Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: No known common issues with this engine.
    *   Solution:
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine is known for coolant intrusion that can lead to engine failure. Symptoms include white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and engine misfires. This is due to a design flaw where the cylinder head can crack allowing coolant to leak into the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the engine is often necessary. Sometimes a cylinder head replacement can fix it, but it depends on the severity of the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+ (Engine Replacement), $2,000 - $4,000+ (Cylinder Head Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found (However, Ford has issued Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) addressing this issue.)

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 1.5L EcoBoost, the 2.0L EcoBoost can suffer from coolant intrusion into the cylinders due to cylinder head cracking. Symptoms are the same: white smoke, coolant loss, and misfires.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement or cylinder head replacement, depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+ (Engine Replacement), $2,000 - $4,000+ (Cylinder Head Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found (However, Ford has issued Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) addressing this issue.)

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or difficulty engaging gears. This can sometimes be attributed to low transmission fluid or degraded fluid.
    *   Solution: Check and replace transmission fluid. If the issue persists, further diagnostics are required, which could lead to valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Fluid Change), $800 - $1,500+ (Valve Body), $3,000 - $5,000+ (Transmission Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Known Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: No known common issues with this engine.
    *   Solution:
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 3 infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Performing a "soft reset" (holding the power button and fast forward button simultaneously) is a temporary fix. Software updates from Ford can address the problem long-term. In some cases, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update), $500 - $1000+ (APIM Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This is often attributed to parasitic draw from various modules.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic testing to identify the source of the parasitic draw. Possible fixes include updating module software, replacing faulty modules, or repairing wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Diagnosis), $100+ (Battery Replacement), $200+ (Module/Wiring Repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the power liftgate not opening or closing properly, or becoming stuck. This can be caused by a faulty liftgate motor, sensors, or latch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+, depending on the specific part needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Known Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: No known common issues with this engine.
    *   Solution:
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix:
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford Escape faces some notable reliability concerns, primarily related to the 1.5L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines and the potential for coolant intrusion. These engine issues can be quite severe, leading to costly repairs or engine replacement. The 6-speed transmission can also exhibit shifting problems. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and battery drain issues are also present. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect any 2019 Escape, especially those with the EcoBoost engines, and be aware of the potential for significant repair costs.
