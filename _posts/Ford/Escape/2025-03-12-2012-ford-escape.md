Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2012 Ford Escape, categorized by component and powertrain option, formatted for your website.

The 2012 Ford Escape is a compact SUV that was available with three engine choices: a 2.5L Duratec I4 (171 hp, 171 lb-ft torque), a 3.0L Duratec V6 (240 hp, 223 lb-ft torque), and a 1.6L EcoBoost I4 (178 hp, 184 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Escape's practicality, cargo space, and relatively affordable price point. However, some common complaints include concerns about reliability, fuel economy (especially with the V6), and the dated interior design compared to some competitors of the same year.

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford Escape presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly coolant intrusion in the 1.6L EcoBoost and coolant leaks in the 3.0L V6, can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues like harsh shifting can also be expensive to address. Other common issues like electrical problems, suspension wear, and interior trim defects can further add to the overall cost of ownership. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be significant and require substantial investment. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to assess the condition of critical components and anticipate potential repairs.
