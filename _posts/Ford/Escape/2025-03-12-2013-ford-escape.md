The 2013 Ford Escape was a significant redesign marking the beginning of the third generation. It offered a more modern and stylish design compared to its predecessors. Engine options included a 2.5L Duratec 4-cylinder (168 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque), a 1.6L EcoBoost 4-cylinder (178 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L EcoBoost 4-cylinder (240 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Escape's improved fuel economy with the EcoBoost engines, its modern interior, and available technology. Common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the early EcoBoost engines, transmission problems, and some electrical glitches.
