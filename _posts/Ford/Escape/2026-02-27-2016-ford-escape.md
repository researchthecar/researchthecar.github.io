### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford Escape generally presents a reliable profile, particularly with its 2.5L engine option. The EcoBoost engines, while offering better performance and fuel economy, have shown some susceptibility to coolant leaks from the thermostat housing and potential turbocharger issues, which are common for turbocharged engines of this era. The automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit shuddering or hesitation, often addressable with proper maintenance. Electrical gremlins, such as door lock actuators and infotainment system glitches, are also noted but not overwhelmingly prevalent. Overall, the Escape is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine and transmission-related concerns and factor in potential repair costs for these components.
