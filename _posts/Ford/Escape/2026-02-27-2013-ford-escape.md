### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Ford Escape generally presents a decent reliability record, with the naturally aspirated 2.5L engine being the most robust option. The EcoBoost engines, particularly the 1.6L and 2.0L variants, are prone to cooling system leaks and turbocharger issues, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting or hesitation, often requiring fluid services or component replacements. Electrical gremlins, most notably with the MyFord Touch infotainment system, are also a recurring concern. While the suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread critical failures, potential buyers should be mindful of the powertrain and electronic system's documented weaknesses.
