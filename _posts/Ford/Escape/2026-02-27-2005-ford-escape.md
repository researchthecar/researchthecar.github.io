### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford Escape presents a mixed reliability profile. While the engines and transmissions can be robust with proper maintenance, common issues like intake manifold leaks on the 2.3L and coolant leaks on the 3.0L V6, along with torque converter shudder and slipping gears in the automatic transmission, are frequently reported. Suspension components such as struts and ball joints are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, including window regulators and instrument clusters, can add to repair costs. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and prioritize regular maintenance to mitigate them.
