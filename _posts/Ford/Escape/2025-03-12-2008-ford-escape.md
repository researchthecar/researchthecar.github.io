The 2008 Ford Escape is a compact SUV that was popular for its fuel efficiency and practicality. It was available with several engine options: a 2.3L inline-4 (I4) producing around 153 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 producing around 200 horsepower and 193 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid variant featuring a 2.3L I4 paired with an electric motor. The transmission options included a 4-speed automatic for the I4 and a 4-speed automatic for the V6. The hybrid model used a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners generally appreciated the Escape's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel economy (especially the hybrid). Common dislikes included a dated interior design, some reliability issues, and lackluster performance from the base I4 engine.

**Engine**

**2.3L I4**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, check engine light illumination (often with codes related to misfires or lean conditions). This issue is commonly linked to worn or faulty ignition coils and spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replace the ignition coils and spark plugs. Inspect and replace any cracked or damaged vacuum hoses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ depending on how many coils need to be replaced and if the spark plugs can be replaced with a kit.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination (often with codes related to EVAP system), difficulty fueling the vehicle, rough idle.
    * Solution: Replace the purge valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illumination (often with codes related to catalytic converter efficiency), decreased fuel economy, and a sulfur-like smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ depending on aftermarket vs. OEM.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, overheating, visible coolant leaks (often from the water pump or thermostat housing).
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. This may involve replacing the water pump, thermostat housing, hoses, or gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the location and complexity of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.3L I4 Hybrid**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (I4 & V6)**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, transmission not engaging properly. These issues are often related to low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid (if low and not contaminated). A transmission fluid flush *may* help, but can also exacerbate existing problems if the fluid is very old. If those don't fix it, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid check/top off) - $300 (fluid flush) - $1500 - $3500+ (rebuild/replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially when accelerating from a stop. Can also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. This often involves removing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+ depending on labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

**CVT (Hybrid)**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises, slipping, failure to accelerate properly, or complete loss of drive. CVTs are generally less robust than traditional automatic transmissions.
    *   Solution: CVT replacement. Rebuilds are possible but often less reliable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ depending on new vs. used and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, poor handling, excessive body roll during cornering, leaking fluid from the struts/shocks.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks. It is generally recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle (pair).
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, clunking noises (especially when going over bumps), uneven tire wear.
