The 2002 Ford Escape was a popular compact SUV, marking Ford's entry into this growing market. It offered a blend of car-like handling with SUV practicality. Engine options included a 2.0L Zetec inline-4 producing 130 hp and 135 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 200 hp and 193 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission (though the manual was less common, especially with the V6). The Escape was liked for its maneuverability and relatively affordable price. Common dislikes included lower fuel economy than some competitors and some reliability concerns, especially with older models.

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford Escape has several common issues, primarily related to the engine (intake manifold leaks, misfires), transmission (harsh shifting, torque converter problems), and electrical components (power windows, door locks). Rust is also a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Repair costs can vary significantly depending on the severity of the issue, but some problems like transmission rebuilds or rust repair can be quite expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase.
