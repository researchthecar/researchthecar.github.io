The 2024 Ford Escape is a compact SUV offering a variety of powertrain options to suit different needs. Engine choices include a 1.5L EcoBoost inline-3 (180 hp and 199 lb-ft of torque), a 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4 (250 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.5L hybrid inline-4 (total system output of 192 hp), as well as a plug-in hybrid option using the same 2.5L inline-4 (total system output of 210 hp). Most models are equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid and plug-in hybrid models use a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Owners often praise the Escape for its comfortable ride, spacious interior (especially for passengers), and fuel-efficient hybrid options. Some common dislikes include the sometimes unrefined behavior of the 1.5L EcoBoost engine, and the complicated infotainment system.
