The 2006 Ford Escape was a popular compact SUV offering a blend of practicality and affordability. Engine options included a 2.3L Duratec 23 inline-4 producing 153 hp and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duratec 30 V6 generating 200 hp and 193 lb-ft of torque. The 2.3L engine was typically paired with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L engine came standard with a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Escape's fuel efficiency (especially with the 4-cylinder), comfortable ride, and maneuverability. Common complaints included a somewhat dated interior, occasionally underpowered performance (with the 4-cylinder), and some reliability concerns as the vehicles aged.

**Summary**

The 2006 Ford Escape is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any older car, it's prone to certain issues. The most common problems include oil leaks, intake manifold gasket leaks, transmission issues (especially with harsh shifting), and rust. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission work or catalytic converter replacement, can be costly. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity and cost of repairs will depend on the vehicle's maintenance history, mileage, and overall condition.
