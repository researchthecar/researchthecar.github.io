The 2016 Ford Escape is a compact SUV known for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride. Available engine options include a 2.5L Duratec I4 engine (168 hp, 170 lb-ft of torque), a 1.6L EcoBoost I4 engine (178 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 engine (240 hp, 270 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Escape's user-friendly infotainment system and spacious cargo area, while some criticisms include its somewhat cramped rear seating and occasional reports of electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks into the cylinders causing white smoke from the exhaust, rough running engine, and eventual engine failure. This is due to cracks developing in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cylinder head, potentially requires complete engine replacement if damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, loud whining or screeching noises from the engine, check engine light. The turbocharger can fail due to oil starvation or component wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.6L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Leaks and Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, engine overheating, white smoke from exhaust (indicating a coolant leak into the combustion chamber), "Check Engine" light. Can lead to engine damage if not addressed quickly. This can occur due to a design flaw or cracks in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cylinder head or, in severe cases, the entire engine. Pressure testing the cooling system can pinpoint the leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: **17V051000** (This recall addresses the engine cylinder head issue, which can cause coolant leaks and overheating. The remedy involves checking the coolant level, pressure testing the cooling system, and replacing the engine, if necessary.)

*   **Evaporative Emission (EVAP) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty refueling (gas pump shuts off frequently), strong fuel odor, "Check Engine" light. This can be due to a faulty purge valve, vent valve, or charcoal canister.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty EVAP system component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body or a transmission rebuild/replacement
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Often related to worn sway bar links or bushings.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, frequent jump starts.
    *   Solution: Identifying the parasitic drain (often related to a faulty module or accessory) and repairing or replacing the component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The backup camera either shows a blue screen, a distorted image, or no image at all when the vehicle is put in reverse.

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford Escape has some notable issues, particularly with the 1.6L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines, which can suffer from coolant leaks leading to serious engine damage. Electrical problems, especially related to the MyFord Touch/Sync system and battery drain, are also relatively common. The 6-speed transmission can experience shifting issues, and suspension noises are frequently reported. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially very expensive repairs, with engine-related problems being the most costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the cooling system, check for any unusual engine noises or rough running, and thoroughly test the electrical systems, especially if considering a model with the 1.6L or 2.0L EcoBoost engine.
