The 2005 Ford Escape was a popular compact SUV known for its practicality, decent fuel economy, and available hybrid powertrain. Engine options for the 2005 Escape included a 2.3L Duratec 23 inline-4, producing around 153 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duratec 30 V6, delivering approximately 200 horsepower and 193 lb-ft of torque. The 2.3L was typically paired with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L came exclusively with a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the Escape's car-like handling, comfortable ride, and spacious cargo area. Common complaints centered around reliability issues, particularly with the automatic transmission and certain engine components, as well as some concerns regarding interior plastics and long-term durability.
