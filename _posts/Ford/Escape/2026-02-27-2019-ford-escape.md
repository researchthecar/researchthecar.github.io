### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Ford Escape presents a mixed reliability profile. The primary concern lies with the 1.5L EcoBoost engines, particularly the 3-cylinder variant, due to potential coolant intrusion issues, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as hesitation and shuddering, are also reported with the automatic gearbox. Electrical gremlins, including infotainment system glitches and battery drain, can be frustrating. However, the 2.0L EcoBoost and the hybrid powertrain options appear to be more robust. For those considering a 2019 Escape, opting for the 2.0L EcoBoost or the hybrid model, and being aware of potential electrical issues, would be advisable for a more reliable ownership experience.
