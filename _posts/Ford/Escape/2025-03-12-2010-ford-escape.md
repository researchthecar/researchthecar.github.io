The 2010 Ford Escape is a compact SUV that offered a blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and affordability. It was available with three engine options: a 2.5L Duratec I4 producing 171 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 240 horsepower and 223 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L Atkinson-cycle I4 Hybrid (producing a combined 177 horsepower). The I4 engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the V6 came with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid used a CVT. Owners generally appreciate the Escape's comfortable ride, decent fuel economy (especially with the I4 and Hybrid options), and cargo space. Common complaints include a somewhat dated interior design, average handling, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford Escape presents a mixed bag in terms of reliability. While generally a practical and affordable SUV, it does suffer from a few common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the hybrid battery for hybrid models and transmission issues in models equipped with the standard 6-speed automatic. Engine issues are less pervasive but still present. Suspension and electrical gremlins can also surface. Repair costs vary widely, with the potential for expensive hybrid battery replacements. Overall, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended, particularly focusing on the transmission and hybrid system (if applicable).
