## Engine

### 2.3L I4
**Worn Piston Rings**
- **Symptoms:** Excessive oil consumption, blue smoke from exhaust, loss of engine power.
- **Solution:** Engine rebuild or replacement of piston rings.
- **Cost:** $1,500 - $3,000

**Coolant Leaks (Intake Manifold)**
- **Symptoms:** Visible coolant leaks around the intake manifold, overheating.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gasket or the manifold itself.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


### 3.0L V6
**Timing Chain Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Rattling noise from the front of the engine, check engine light, rough idle.
- **Solution:** Replacement of timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
- **Cost:** $1,000 - $2,000

**Spark Plug Blowout**
- **Symptoms:** Engine misfires, rough idle, loss of power, potential for spark plug to be ejected.
- **Solution:** Repair of cylinder head threads and installation of new spark plugs.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Transmission

### 4-Speed Automatic (4F50N)
**Slipping Gears**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission hesitates to shift, slips out of gear, or fails to engage.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or full transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2,500

**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission fluid smells burnt, delayed shifting, especially under load.
- **Solution:** Installation of an auxiliary transmission cooler.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, poor handling, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Leaking Struts/Shocks**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, visible fluid leaks on shock/strut bodies, reduced handling.
- **Solution:** Replacement of struts or shocks.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


## Electrical

### Standard Electrical System
**Faulty Window Regulators**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows fail to operate, make grinding noises, or get stuck.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the window regulator motor and mechanism.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400

**Instrument Cluster Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Gauges not working, warning lights staying on or not illuminating, dimming display.

### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford Escape presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the 2.3L I4 and 3.0L V6, are prone to issues like worn piston rings, coolant leaks, and timing chain problems, respectively, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission can suffer from slipping gears and overheating. Suspension components, such as control arm bushings and struts, are also noted for wear. Electrical issues like faulty window regulators and instrument cluster failures are not uncommon. While the exterior and interior have fewer widespread critical issues, the rear hatch latch and HVAC blower motor can be points of concern. Overall, potential owners should be prepared for potential maintenance related to the powertrain and suspension.
