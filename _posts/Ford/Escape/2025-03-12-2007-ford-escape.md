The 2007 Ford Escape is a compact SUV that was offered with three engine options: a 2.3L inline-4 producing 153 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 193 lb-ft of torque, and a hybrid 2.3L inline-4. The non-hybrid engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid engine was paired with a CVT. Owners generally appreciate the Escape's fuel efficiency (particularly the hybrid model) and maneuverability. Common complaints include reports of rust, especially in areas with road salt, and a somewhat dated interior compared to newer SUVs.
