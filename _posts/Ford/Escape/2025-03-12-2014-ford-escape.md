Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 Ford Escape, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2014 Ford Escape marked a departure from the boxier models of the past, embracing a more modern and aerodynamic design. It's a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency, agile handling, and available technology. However, it's not without its share of problems. Engine options include a 2.5L Duratec I4 (168 hp, 170 lb-ft torque), a 1.6L EcoBoost I4 (178 hp, 184 lb-ft torque), and a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 (240 hp, 270 lb-ft torque). All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Escape's comfortable ride and user-friendly infotainment system. Common complaints include engine issues, transmission problems (especially with the earlier model years of this generation), and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**2.5L Duratec I4**

*   **No Issues Found**

**1.6L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks into the cylinders, often caused by cracking in the cylinder head. This can lead to misfires, rough idling, white smoke from the exhaust, and ultimately, engine failure. Low coolant levels can also be observed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head is often required. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether the head can be repaired or needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: 17V-209.

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whining noises from the turbocharger, check engine light illuminated. Can be caused by oil starvation or bearing failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. Ensuring proper oil changes and using the correct oil type can help prevent this.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Overheating**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Temperature gauge rising quickly, steam coming from the engine compartment, burning smell.
        *   Solution: Inspect and replace faulty components such as thermostat, radiator cap, or coolant hoses. A pressure test of the cooling system can help identify leaks.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the failed components

* **Evaporative Emission System Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated. Possible fuel odor.
    * Solution: Smoke test the system to identify the leak. Common culprits include a faulty purge valve, gas cap, or vapor canister.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 1.6L EcoBoost, coolant can leak into the cylinders due to a cracked cylinder head. This leads to misfires, rough running, and white smoke.
    *   Solution: Cylinder head replacement or engine replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: 17V-209.

* **Evaporative Emission System Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated. Possible fuel odor.
    * Solution: Smoke test the system to identify the leak. Common culprits include a faulty purge valve, gas cap, or vapor canister.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, especially when cold. Jerking or clunking noises during gear changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update of the PCM can resolve the issue. However, in most cases, valve body replacement is needed. Flushing the transmission fluid and filter change could provide temporary relief.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100-$200. Valve body replacement: $800-$1500. Transmission rebuild or replacement: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revs higher than normal without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. Difficulty accelerating, especially uphill.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or a faulty torque converter. Requires thorough diagnosis. Transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Escape presents a mix of potential issues, with engine problems (especially the 1.6L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines) being the most concerning due to the potential for costly repairs related to cylinder head cracking. Transmission issues and electrical glitches with the MyFord Touch system are also relatively common complaints. The severity of these problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and be aware of these potential issues before purchasing.
