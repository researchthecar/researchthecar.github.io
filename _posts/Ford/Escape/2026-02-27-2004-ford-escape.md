### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford Escape presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.0L SPI engine is prone to coolant leaks and ignition coil issues, while the 3.0L Duratec V6 can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and camshaft sensor failures. The automatic transmission, while generally functional, can experience slipping and overheating. Suspension components like struts and ball joints are common wear items that may require replacement. Electrical issues, particularly with window regulators and instrument clusters, are also noted. Exterior and interior components are generally robust with no widespread critical failures reported. Regular maintenance is key to mitigating many of these potential problems.
