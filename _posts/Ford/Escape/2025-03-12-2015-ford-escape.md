**Summary**

The 2015 Ford Escape can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The most concerning is the potential for engine failure in the 1.6L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines due to coolant intrusion, which can be a costly repair. Transmission issues, electrical glitches with the MyFord Touch system, and suspension noises are also common complaints. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended, especially focusing on the cooling system and turbocharger.
