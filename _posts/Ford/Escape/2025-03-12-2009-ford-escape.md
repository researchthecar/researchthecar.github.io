The 2009 Ford Escape is a compact SUV known for its fuel efficiency (especially the hybrid model), maneuverability, and relatively affordable price point. It offered three engine options: a 2.5L Duratec I4 engine (171 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L Duratec V6 engine (200 hp and 193 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.5L I4 Hybrid (155 hp). Depending on the engine, it was paired with either a 4-speed automatic or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Common complaints about the 2009 Ford Escape include reported rust issues, electrical malfunctions, and some drivetrain problems. However, many owners appreciate its practicality and comfortable ride.

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of rough or jerky shifting between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration.

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford Escape can be a reliable vehicle, but it's important to be aware of some common issues.
