The 2001 Ford Escape marked Ford's entry into the compact SUV market, offering a blend of car-like handling and SUV versatility. It came with three engine options: a 2.0L Zetec inline-4 producing 127 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 200 horsepower and 193 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.3L Mazda L engine. The 2.0L engine was available with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L engine was paired exclusively with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Escape's maneuverability, spacious interior for its class, and available V6 power. Common complaints centered around fuel economy, especially with the V6, and some reliability issues that became more prevalent as the vehicles aged.

**Summary**

The 2001 Ford Escape, while a popular and versatile vehicle in its time, is now prone to various issues due to age. Engine oil leaks, transmission problems, and suspension wear are the most significant concerns. Electrical problems such as window motor failures and alternator issues are also common. Rust is a major concern, particularly in areas with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or rust repair, can be costly. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect these vehicles for these common issues and factor potential repair costs into their purchase decision.
