**Introduction**

The 2010 Ford Escape is a compact crossover SUV available in front-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations. It comes standard with a 2.5-liter Duratec four-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The Escape also offers a 3.0-liter Duratec V6 engine as an upgrade, paired with either a six-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission. The V6 engine provides 240 horsepower and 233 lb-ft of torque, while the four-cylinder engine produces 171 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque.

The Escape is praised for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available V6 engine. However, it has received criticism for its lack of power with the base four-cylinder engine, poor fuel economy, and cramped third-row seating (available on select models).
