### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford Escape presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine (coolant and oil leaks, intake manifold gaskets on V6), transmission (slipping and overheating), and suspension components (ball joints, tie rods). Electrical gremlins like window regulators and instrument cluster problems are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, potential buyers should be aware of these recurring issues and factor in potential repair costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate some of these reliability concerns.
