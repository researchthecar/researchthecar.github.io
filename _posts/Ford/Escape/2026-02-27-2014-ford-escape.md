### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ford Escape, particularly models equipped with the EcoBoost engines, shows a tendency towards cooling system leaks and turbocharger problems. The automatic transmission, while generally functional, can exhibit issues like shuddering and hesitation, often requiring fluid services or more involved repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially with the MyFord Touch infotainment system, are also a point of concern for some owners. The 2.5L naturally aspirated engine and the chassis/suspension appear to be more robust. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection, focusing on the engine and transmission health.
