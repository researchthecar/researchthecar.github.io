### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Ford Escape presents a generally reliable package, especially when considering its hybrid and PHEV variants, which show minimal reported issues. The 2.0L EcoBoost engine and its associated transmission also appear to be robust. However, potential buyers should be aware of isolated reports concerning the 1.5L EcoBoost engine's coolant ingestion problem and occasional transmission hesitation with the 8-speed automatic. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and intermittent battery drain, are also noted but do not appear to be widespread. Overall, the Escape is a competitive offering with a decent reliability outlook, provided potential buyers are aware of and prepared for these specific, though not universal, concerns.
