The 2021 Ford Escape is a compact SUV that offers a blend of fuel efficiency, practicality, and technology. Engine options include a 1.5L EcoBoost inline-3 engine producing 181 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4 engine producing 250 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L iVCT Atkinson Cycle inline-4 hybrid engine producing 200 horsepower. All gas engines come standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission, while the hybrid utilizes an eCVT. Owners often praise the Escape's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include the sometimes unrefined engine noise from the 1.5L EcoBoost and the relatively small cargo area compared to some competitors.

Engine problems, particularly with the 1.5L EcoBoost and 2.0L EcoBoost engines, can be concerning due to the potential for costly repairs. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also lead to significant expenses. Electrical issues, especially related to the infotainment system, are more common annoyances than major mechanical failures. Suspension and interior issues appear to be less prevalent overall. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially major repairs, with estimated costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and its solution.
