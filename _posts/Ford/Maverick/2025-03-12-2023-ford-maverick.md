The 2023 Ford Maverick is a compact pickup truck that offers a unique blend of practicality, fuel efficiency, and affordability. It comes standard with a 2.5L Hybrid engine producing 191 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque. An optional 2.0L EcoBoost engine is available, producing 250 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. The hybrid engine is paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while the EcoBoost engine is paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Maverick for its small size (making it easy to maneuver), its excellent fuel economy (particularly the hybrid), and its truck bed utility in a compact package. Common complaints include limited rear seat space, some low-quality interior materials, and the availability of certain options being restricted due to production constraints.
