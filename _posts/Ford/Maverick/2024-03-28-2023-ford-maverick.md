**Introduction**

The 2023 Ford Maverick is a compact pickup truck available with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine (191 horsepower, 181 lb-ft of torque) paired with either an eight-speed automatic transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT), or a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (250 horsepower, 277 lb-ft of torque) mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.

Praised for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and versatility, the Maverick has also been criticized for its limited towing capacity and unimpressive interior quality.
