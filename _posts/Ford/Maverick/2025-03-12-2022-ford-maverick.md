The 2022 Ford Maverick is a compact pickup truck that reintroduced the small truck segment to Ford's lineup. It comes standard with a 2.5L 4-cylinder Hybrid engine that produces 191 horsepower and 155 lb-ft of torque, paired with a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) and front-wheel drive. An optional 2.0L EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine is also available, generating 250 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, coupled with an 8-speed automatic transmission, and offers available all-wheel drive. Owners generally appreciate the Maverick's fuel efficiency, affordability, and versatility. However, some common complaints include long order times, limited availability of certain options, and some reported issues with specific components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Hybrid**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of the 2.5L hybrid engine stalling unexpectedly, typically at low speeds or while idling. This can occur intermittently and may not always trigger a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Potential fixes include software updates to the powertrain control module (PCM), inspection and replacement of faulty sensors (e.g., crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor), or addressing issues with the fuel delivery system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L EcoBoost**

*   **Wastegate Actuator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of wastegate actuator failure or malfunction leading to a loss of boost pressure, resulting in reduced engine power and potential engine misfires. Some owners have noted a rattling noise coming from the turbocharger area.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the wastegate actuator or the entire turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**CVT (2.5L Hybrid)**

*   **Hesitation/Rough Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported hesitation during acceleration or rough shifting behavior from the CVT. This can manifest as a delay in power delivery or a jerky feeling during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Typically addressed by performing a transmission control module (TCM) software update or, in more severe cases, replacing the CVT assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ for software updates, $3000 - $6000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (2.0L EcoBoost)**

*   **Harsh or delayed shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifts, slips, or delayed engagement when shifting between gears. The issue is generally most noticeable when shifting at low speeds
    *   Solution: A fix for the issue may be solved by performing a software update for the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for software updates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Poor Load Carrying Capacity**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive rear suspension sag when carrying loads in the bed or towing. This can lead to reduced ground clearance, compromised handling, and potential damage to the suspension components.
    *   Solution: Upgrading the rear springs, adding helper springs, or installing air suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (SYNC) may experience freezing, crashing, or unexpected reboots. This can affect features such as navigation, audio, and climate control.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset, updating the software, or replacing the infotainment system module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates/reset) - $500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners reporting excessive battery drain leading to a dead battery, especially when the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw, replacing the battery, or performing a software update to optimize power management.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for battery replacement, $100 - $500+ for diagnosing and fixing parasitic draws.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Backup camera displaying a black screen, distorted image, or failing to activate. This can compromise safety and visibility during reversing.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and repairing the camera wiring, replacing the camera module, or updating the infotainment system software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of misaligned tailgates that are difficult to close properly or have uneven gaps. This can affect the vehicle's appearance and potentially lead to water leaks.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the tailgate hinges or replacing the tailgate if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Bed Cover Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Aftermarket tonneau covers may not seal properly, allowing water to enter the truck bed during rain or washing.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and adjusting the cover seals, or replacing the cover with a higher-quality unit.
