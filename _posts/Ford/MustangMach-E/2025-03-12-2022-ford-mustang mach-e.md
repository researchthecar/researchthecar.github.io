Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E, formatted for your website. The 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E is an all-electric SUV that blends Mustang-inspired styling with electric vehicle technology. The 2022 Mach-E comes standard with a single-motor, rear-wheel-drive configuration, or an available dual-motor, all-wheel-drive configuration. Battery options include a standard-range battery (70 kWh usable) and an extended-range battery (91 kWh usable). The Mach-E with the extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive produces 290 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, while the all-wheel-drive variant makes 346 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque. The GT trim boosts output even further. Owners appreciate the Mach-E's sporty handling, quick acceleration, and attractive design. Some common criticisms include software glitches, charging inconsistencies, and limited availability of public charging infrastructure.

**Electric Motor**

**Standard Range Single Motor RWD / Dual Motor AWD**

*   **HV Battery Contactors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HV battery contactors, internal switching mechanisms that engage/disengage the high-voltage battery pack, can experience overheating. This can lead to a loss of power while driving, the vehicle not starting, and in some cases, a fire risk. Affected vehicles may display a "Stop Safely Now" message on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Ford issued a recall and the fix involves a software update to the Battery Energy Control Module (BECM). This update is intended to monitor the temperature of the contactors and reduce power if overheating is detected, preventing thermal runaway. In some instances, the contactors themselves may need to be replaced if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under recall, otherwise potentially $500-$2,000+ if not covered by warranty, depending on the extent of the damage and if the battery pack needs to be removed/disassembled.
    *   Recalls: 22S41 (Covers HV Battery Contactor Overheating), 22S09 (DC Fast Charge Overheating)

**Extended Range Single Motor RWD / Dual Motor AWD**

*   **Reduced Power/ Turtle Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing sudden and unexpected reductions in power, sometimes referred to as "turtle mode." This can occur during normal driving conditions or while accelerating, causing the vehicle to slow down dramatically. The issue may be accompanied by warning lights or error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: The cause is varied, and may involve software issues, battery management system problems, or issues with the drivetrain. Diagnosis by a qualified EV technician is essential. Software updates have been issued to address some of these issues. In some cases, a component replacement (such as a battery sensor or drive motor module) may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update at the dealership) to $5,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: 22S41 (Covers HV Battery Contactor Overheating), 22S09 (DC Fast Charge Overheating)

**Charging System**

*   **DC Fast Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties with DC fast charging are a common complaint. This can manifest as slow charging speeds, failure to initiate charging, or premature termination of the charging session.
    *   Solution: Software updates were made to address DC fast charging to reduce the risk of overheating.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under recall or warranty.
    *   Recalls: 22S09

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Subframe Bolt**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inadequate torque of the rear subframe bolts may cause them to loosen over time. This could lead to vibrations, clunking noises from the rear of the vehicle, and potentially affect handling and stability.
    *   Solution: Ford issued a recall to inspect and tighten the rear subframe bolts. If any bolts are missing or damaged, they will be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under recall.
    *   Recalls: 22S27

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 4 infotainment system can experience frequent freezing, lagging, and unexpected crashes. This affects navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions. Some users also report issues with wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the primary method to address these issues. Performing a "soft reset" (holding down the power and seek forward buttons) can temporarily resolve the issue. If the issue persists, a dealer visit for a software update or potential hardware replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered under warranty or free if software update, potentially $500-$1500+ if a hardware component needs to be replaced (e.g., APIM - Accessory Protocol Interface Module).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 12V battery can drain prematurely, leading to starting problems, a dead vehicle, or issues with the infotainment system. This issue can be caused by various factors, including software glitches that prevent the vehicle from entering sleep mode or accessory systems drawing excessive power when the vehicle is off.
    *   Solution: Dealerships will perform diagnostic tests to determine the root cause of the battery drain. Software updates, replacement of the 12V battery with a new revision, or repair/replacement of the parasitic drain source can be performed to remedy the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300+ for a new 12V battery, software update covered by warranty, drain source repair can vary widely.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Panoramic Roof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The panoramic roof can leak, particularly around the seals. This may result in water stains on the headliner or dampness inside the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the panoramic roof seals or complete replacement of the glass panel. Ensuring the drain tubes are clear of debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 for seal replacement, $1,000-$2,000+ for glass replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Windshield trim falling off**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The trim around the windshield may become loose or completely detach from the vehicle.
    *   Solution: The dealership will reattach the trim. In some instances, clips or other pieces may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$250+ for replacement of clips or for a new trim piece.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E, while a well-regarded EV, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and 12V battery, are prevalent and can be frustrating. High-voltage battery contactor problems can pose a serious safety risk. While most of these issues are addressed by recalls or warranty repairs, they can cause inconvenience and downtime. The cost of repairs outside of warranty can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for more significant problems like battery or infotainment system replacements. It is crucial to check for completed recalls and thoroughly inspect the vehicle's electronics before purchasing a used 2022 Mach-E.
