The 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E is an all-electric SUV that blends Mustang-inspired styling with modern EV technology. It is available in several trim levels, including Select, Premium, California Route 1, GT, and Rally, each offering different levels of performance and features. The 2023 Mustang Mach-E is equipped with one of two electric motor configurations: a standard range battery or an extended range battery. The rear-wheel drive GT models offer up to 480 horsepower and 600 lb-ft of torque. Some of the reasons why people like this car include its sharp exterior styling, peppy acceleration, modern technology, and decent range. Some common complaints include the infotainment system glitches, limited rear visibility, and stiff suspension in some trims.

**Electric Motor**

**Standard Range Battery**

* **Reduced Power/Turtle Mode**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing reduced power, often referred to as "turtle mode," even with sufficient battery charge. This can happen unexpectedly while driving, limiting speed and acceleration. The vehicle may display a "Powertrain Malfunction/Reduced Power" message.
    * Solution: A software update to the Battery Energy Control Module (BECM) and/or Drive Inverter Module (DIM). In some cases, battery cell replacement may be required if the issue is due to faulty battery modules.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 if covered under warranty. Otherwise, battery module replacement could range from $2,000 - $8,000+, depending on the number of modules and labor. Software updates are typically free.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Extended Range Battery**

* **High Voltage Battery Junction Box Overheating**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners reported that the high voltage battery junction box is overheating, causing the vehicle to not be able to charge and sometimes completely shutting down the vehicle.
    * Solution: Replacement of the high voltage battery junction box.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Drivetrain**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

* **Excessive Road Noise/Harsh Ride (GT Trim)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners of the GT trim have complained about excessive road noise and a harsh ride, especially on rough road surfaces. This is often attributed to the stiffer suspension tuning and larger wheels that come standard on this model.
    * Solution: While there is no official fix, some owners have opted to replace the factory shocks with aftermarket ones designed for improved comfort. Other options include using smaller diameter wheels and tires.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the solution chosen.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 4 infotainment system is prone to freezing, lagging, and occasional crashes. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Software updates from Ford have addressed some of these issues. Performing a "soft reset" (holding down the power and seek forward buttons) can sometimes resolve temporary glitches. In more severe cases, a full system reboot or module replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates. $500 - $1,500+ for module replacement if not covered under warranty.
    * Recalls: None Found
* **12V Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the 12V battery draining prematurely, especially when the vehicle is left parked for extended periods. This can result in the car failing to start or various electrical systems malfunctioning.
    * Solution: Ford released a TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) addressing this issue. The solution involves a software update to improve battery management and prevent excessive drain. In some cases, a new 12V battery might be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates. $100 - $300 for a new 12V battery.
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Unintended Acceleration/Braking Issues (Rare)**
    * Description/Symptoms: A small number of owners have reported instances of unintended acceleration or braking issues, often linked to software glitches within the driver-assist systems (e.g., adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking).
    * Solution: This issue is typically addressed through software updates to the affected modules. It's crucial to report such incidents to Ford and have the vehicle inspected by a certified technician.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for software updates.
    * Recalls: 22V-427: Recall initiated on June 13, 2022, for unintended acceleration due to unintended activation of the accelerator pedal due to a software malfunction.
* **Backup Camera Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The backup camera display may fail to activate when the vehicle is shifted into reverse, or the image may be distorted or intermittently cut out.
    * Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring harness for damage or loose connections. If the wiring is intact, the camera module may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Panoramic Roof Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported water leaks around the panoramic roof, particularly during heavy rain or after car washes.
    * Solution: Resealing the panoramic roof or replacing the weather stripping. Ensuring the drain tubes are clear of debris.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Headlight Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The headlights may flicker, dim, or fail to illuminate properly, especially the adaptive headlights.
    * Solution: Check headlight bulbs and connections. If the problem persists, the headlight module or ballast may need to be replaced. For adaptive headlights, recalibration or replacement of the headlight motor may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Charge Port Door Malfunction**
    * Description/Symptoms: The charge port door may become stuck, making it difficult to open or close. This can be caused by a faulty latch mechanism or damage to the door itself.
    * Solution: Check the latch mechanism for debris or damage. Lubricate the latch and hinge points. If the problem persists, the charge port door assembly may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Heater Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to heat up properly, or they may only work intermittently.
    * Solution: Check the seat heater wiring and connections. If the wiring is intact, the seat heater element may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Rattling/Squeaking Sounds from Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported annoying rattling or squeaking sounds emanating from the dashboard, especially when driving on rough roads.
    * Solution: This can be tricky to diagnose and fix, as the source of the noise can be difficult to pinpoint. Common causes include loose trim pieces, wiring harnesses rubbing against plastic components, or improperly secured components. Dealerships often use foam padding or shims to dampen the noise.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the repair.

**Summary**

The 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E has some reported issues across multiple categories, with the electrical system and exterior components being the most prevalent. While some problems, like infotainment glitches and 12V battery drain, can often be resolved with software updates, others, such as battery module failures and panoramic roof leaks, can be more costly to repair. The severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially impacting vehicle drivability. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and ensure that any used models have had the relevant recalls and TSBs addressed.
