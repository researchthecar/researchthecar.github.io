Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Ford F-150, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration, as requested.

The 2018 Ford F-150 is a popular full-size pickup truck known for its capability, versatility, and technology. Engine options for this year include the 2.7L EcoBoost V6, 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (high output for Raptor), 5.0L V8 Coyote, and a 3.0L Power Stroke diesel. The base engine is the 3.3L Cyclone V6. The 3.5L EcoBoost V6 produces 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the F-150's comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and towing capacity. Common complaints include issues with the 10-speed transmission, certain engine problems, and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise at startup, especially when cold. This is due to worn or failing cam phasers within the variable valve timing (VVT) system. Can lead to rough idling, reduced power, and potential engine damage if left unresolved.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chain, guides, and potentially the VVT solenoids. A TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) often covers diagnosis and repair procedures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Condensation in Intercooler**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running or stuttering, especially during acceleration. This is more prevalent in humid climates. Moisture can accumulate in the intercooler, causing the engine to misfire. This is referred to as "EcoBoost shudder."
    *   Solution: Installation of a weep hole in the intercooler to allow condensation to drain. Some owners also install a catch can to collect the moisture. Ford has released updated intercooler designs to mitigate this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8 Coyote**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable drop in oil level between oil changes, requiring frequent topping off. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: Ford released a TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) addressing this issue, which may involve replacing the PCV valve, and performing an oil consumption test. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cold Start Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud rattle or knocking noise upon cold start, lasting for a few seconds. Often attributed to timing chain tensioner issues or the variable valve timing system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioners, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10R80 10-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, or clunking noises during shifts. Hesitation when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission overhaul may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software reflash) - $5,000+ (for rebuild or replacement).
    *   Recalls: Recall Number 22V-117: Certain 2014-2018 F-150s were recalled because the transmission could unexpectedly downshift into first gear.

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Backup Camera Failure/Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera. Display may show a black screen or distorted image.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the camera module or wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock properly, requiring manual operation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SYNC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, or being unresponsive; Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation system glitches.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets, or replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module).

**Summary**

The 2018 Ford F-150 has some notable issues, primarily centered around the 3.5L EcoBoost's cam phaser problem and the 5.0L Coyote's oil consumption. The 10-speed transmission is another common source of complaints. Electrical glitches, such as backup camera and door lock actuator failures, also occur. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work. While the F-150 remains a popular truck, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used model before purchase.
