**Summary**

The 2022 Ford F-150, while generally reliable, does experience some common issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the infotainment system, are fairly frequent. Engine-related issues vary depending on the engine type but can range from relatively minor (wastegate actuator, DEF issues) to quite serious (cam phasers, excessive oil consumption, high voltage battery) which can get expensive. Transmission issues with the 10-speed automatic, while not as common as some other issues, can also lead to significant repair costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected, especially if purchasing a used model.
