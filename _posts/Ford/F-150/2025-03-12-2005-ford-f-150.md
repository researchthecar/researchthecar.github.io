**Summary**

The 2005 Ford F-150, while a popular and generally well-regarded truck, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most concerning and potentially costly issues revolve around the 5.4L Triton engine, particularly the spark plug issues and cam phaser problems. Transmission issues, although less common, can also be expensive to address. Electrical problems, such as GEM failures, can be frustrating due to their intermittent nature. Rust is a concern, especially in colder climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like cam phaser replacement or transmission rebuilds, can be substantial investments. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended to identify any existing or potential problems.
