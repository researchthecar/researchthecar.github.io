### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford F-150 is a generally dependable truck, particularly with its V8 engine options. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the 3-valve V8 engines, specifically concerning spark plug ejection and timing components, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, while not universal, can also arise, with torque converter shudder and harsh shifting being noted. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, as expected in a truck of this age and capability. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster failures and window motor issues, are also reported. Owners should be aware of these potential problems, especially the engine-related ones, and ensure proper maintenance to mitigate risks.
