**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine rattle upon cold start, rough idle, loss of power, check engine light. This often occurs due to issues with the cam phaser locking mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chain, and related components. Updated parts are available.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
