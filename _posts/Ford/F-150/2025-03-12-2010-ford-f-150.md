The 2010 Ford F-150 marked a significant redesign for the popular pickup truck, introducing a more modern design and updated features. Engine options included a 4.6L 2V V8 (248 hp, 294 lb-ft torque), a 4.6L 3V V8 (292 hp, 320 lb-ft torque), and a 5.4L 3V V8 (310 hp, 365 lb-ft torque). The 4.6L engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.4L engine used a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the F-150's comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and towing capabilities. Common dislikes often centered around fuel economy, particularly with the 5.4L engine, and some reliability concerns.
