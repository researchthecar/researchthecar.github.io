### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford F-150 is a generally dependable truck, particularly known for its robust V8 engines. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as spark plug blowout and intake manifold leaks on the Triton V8s, and torque converter problems with the automatic transmissions. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also wear over time. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster malfunctions and window motor failures, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. While these issues exist, they are often addressable with proper maintenance and timely repairs, allowing the F-150 to remain a capable workhorse.
