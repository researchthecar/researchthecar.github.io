**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise, loss of power, check engine light. This often involves the turbocharger wastegate actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, overheating. The water pump can fail prematurely, leading to coolant loss and potential engine damage.

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford F-150 has some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 3.5L EcoBoost (turbo failures) and 5.0L V8 (oil consumption, valvetrain noise), can be costly to address, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting, can also be expensive if they require a rebuild. Electrical and suspension problems are generally less severe in terms of cost, but can still contribute to maintenance expenses. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
