The 2021 Ford F-150 marked a significant redesign for the popular pickup truck. It offered a range of engine options, including the 3.3L Ti-VCT V6 (290 hp, 265 lb-ft of torque), the 2.7L EcoBoost V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), the 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (400 hp, 500 lb-ft of torque), the 5.0L Ti-VCT V8 (400 hp, 410 lb-ft of torque), and the 3.5L PowerBoost Full Hybrid V6 (430 hp, 570 lb-ft of torque). A 10-speed automatic transmission was standard across most of these engines. People appreciated the truck's updated technology, comfortable interior, and strong performance. However, some common complaints included issues with the infotainment system, build quality concerns, and some reliability problems.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Rattling Noise on Startup (Cam Phaser Issue)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A distinct rattling noise, particularly on cold starts, is a common symptom. This often indicates wear or failure of the cam phasers, which control valve timing. The noise usually lasts for a few seconds after startup.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers is the typical solution. This is a complex job requiring specialized tools and knowledge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Loss of Power/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a loss of power or hesitation during acceleration. This can be caused by a variety of issues, including faulty spark plugs, coil packs, or issues with the turbocharger system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific cause is required. This may involve checking spark plugs, coil packs, fuel injectors, and the turbocharger system for leaks or damage. Replacing the faulty component is the typical fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L Ti-VCT V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported the 5.0L V8 consuming more oil than expected, sometimes requiring frequent top-ups between oil changes.
    *   Solution: This can stem from various causes, including worn piston rings or valve seals. A compression test can help diagnose the issue. The repair often involves replacing the piston rings or valve seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have reported experiencing harsh shifting, clunking noises during gear changes, or transmission slipping. These symptoms can be more pronounced at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: The 10R80 transmission is known to have issues with the valve body and CDF drum. A common solution is to replace the valve body or CDF drum. In some cases, a complete transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $6,000+ depending on the component.

    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing a dead battery, particularly if the vehicle sits for an extended period. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a module that is not shutting down properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is required to identify the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve disconnecting modules one by one to isolate the issue. Once identified, the faulty module can be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the component causing the draw.
