### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ford F-150 demonstrates good overall reliability, with its powertrain generally being a strong point. The introduction of the aluminum body brought some unique exterior repair considerations and potential paint issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are the most commonly cited technical problems. Engine-specific issues like oil leaks and turbocharger problems are more prevalent on the 2.7L EcoBoost, while the 3.5L EcoBoost can experience timing chain noise. The V6 and V8 naturally aspirated engines, along with the transmission and suspension, are largely trouble-free. Regular maintenance and addressing early signs of electrical or engine concerns are recommended for optimal long-term reliability.
