**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining or screeching noise from the engine, loss of power, check engine light.  Can be caused by oil starvation to the turbo bearings.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger(s). Ensure proper oil changes and inspect oil feed lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on if one or both turbos are replaced and if the dealer handles the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, hesitation during acceleration.  The 3.5L EcoBoost is known to be sensitive to spark plug condition.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level, needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from exhaust.
    *   Solution: Difficult to fix permanently.  Possible solutions include replacing piston rings, valve seals, or even the entire engine.  Some owners have had limited success with switching to a heavier weight oil.
