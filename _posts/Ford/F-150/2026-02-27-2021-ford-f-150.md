### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Ford F-150 demonstrates a solid reliability record overall, particularly with its naturally aspirated engines and standard chassis components. The EcoBoost engines, while offering excellent performance, have shown some tendencies towards turbocharger issues (2.7L) and timing chain concerns (3.5L). The hybrid powertrain, being newer, has a higher potential for component failures, though this is not yet widespread. Transmission issues, primarily related to shifting quality in the 10-speed automatic, are manageable with software updates or repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, are present but generally not critical. For prospective buyers, focusing on models with the 3.3L V6 or 5.0L V8 engines may offer a slightly more predictable long-term ownership experience, while being aware of potential costs associated with the EcoBoost and hybrid variants.
