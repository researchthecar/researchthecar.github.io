**Introduction:**

The 2004 Ford F-150 is a full-size pickup truck known for its powerful V8 engines and rugged capabilities. It came with three engine options: a 4.6L V8 producing 231 horsepower and 294 lb-ft of torque, a 5.4L V8 with 300 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.8L V10 with 325 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual for the 4.6L engine, a 4-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual for the 5.4L engine, and a 5-speed automatic for the 6.8L engine. Owners have praised the F-150's performance, towing capacity, and overall durability. However, like any vehicle, it has had its fair share of reported issues.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

* **Spark Plug Failure:** Worn or fouled spark plugs can cause misfiring, rough idling, and reduced engine power. The fix involves replacing the faulty spark plugs and may cost around $100 - $200+.

**5.4L V8**

* **Cam Phaser Failure:** The Variable Valve Timing (VVT) cam phasers can malfunction, causing a rattling noise during startup or acceleration, poor fuel economy, and reduced engine power. The solution requires replacing the affected cam phasers and associated components, with a cost ranging from $1,500 - $3,000+.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A failing intake manifold gasket can create a vacuum leak, resulting in rough idling, poor acceleration, and increased fuel consumption. The repair involves replacing the gasket, which may cost around $500 - $1,000+.
* **Knock Sensor Failure:** Faulty knock sensors can lead to incorrect engine timing, causing a loss of power, reduced fuel economy, and potential damage to the engine. Replacing the knock sensors is the solution and typically costs between $300 - $500+.

**6.8L V10**

* **Spark Plug Blowout:** Excessive vibration can cause the spark plugs to blow out of the cylinder heads, resulting in a severe loss of engine power and potential damage to the engine. The fix involves replacing the damaged spark plugs and repairing any related components. The cost can be significant, ranging from $2,000 - $5,000+.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Slippage:** Worn clutches or a faulty torque converter can cause the transmission to slip, resulting in delayed or erratic shifting, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. The fix typically involves rebuilding or replacing the transmission, with a cost ranging from $1,000 - $3,000+.

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** A failing torque converter can cause a shuddering or vibration during acceleration. The solution is to replace the torque converter, costing approximately $1,500 - $2,500+.

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Synchronizer Wear:** Worn synchronizers can make it difficult or impossible to shift gears smoothly. The fix involves replacing the affected synchronizers and associated components, with a cost ranging from $500 - $1,000+.

**Suspension**

* **Front Coil Spring Failure:** Broken or damaged front coil springs can cause a loss of ride height, poor handling, and excessive tire wear. Replacing the coil springs is the solution and may cost around $500 - $1,000+.
* **Rear Leaf Spring Overload:** Excessive weight or towing can overload the rear leaf springs, causing a loss of ride height and reduced handling. The fix is to install helper air bags or replace the leaf springs, with a cost ranging from $500 - $1,500+.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** A faulty alternator can fail to charge the battery, leading to a loss of power, electrical problems, and potential engine damage. Replacing the alternator is the solution and typically costs around $500 - $1,000+.
* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic drain can discharge the battery over time, preventing it from starting the vehicle. The solution is to isolate and repair the source of the drain, which may cost between $100 - $500+.

* **Power Window Failure:** Worn or faulty power window motors or switches can prevent the windows from operating properly. Replacing the affected components is the solution, with a cost ranging from $100 - $500+.

**Summary:**

The 2004 Ford F-150 has been a dependable workhorse for many owners. However, like any vehicle, it has had its fair share of issues. The most severe and costly problems include cam phaser failure, spark plug blowout, and transmission slippage. While some issues are more common than others, most can be resolved with a repair or replacement of the affected components. The severity and cost of potential issues should be considered when making a purchasing decision.
