### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford F-150 is a generally dependable truck, but like many vehicles of its age, it has specific areas that may require attention. The Triton V8 engines, particularly the 5.4L, are known for potential spark plug blowout issues and timing chain rattle, while the 4.6L can suffer from cam sync failures. Intake manifold gasket leaks are common across most engine options. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4R70W and 4R75W, can develop issues with the torque converter clutch and solenoid packs. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster problems and window motor failures, are also reported. Exterior rust, particularly on the frame, is a significant concern in rust-belt regions. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these common repair points and budget accordingly for maintenance and potential repairs.
