The 2015 Ford F-150 marked a significant redesign, moving to an aluminum alloy body to reduce weight and improve fuel economy. Engine options included a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 (325 hp, 375 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (365 hp, 420 lb-ft of torque), a 5.0L V8 (385 hp, 387 lb-ft of torque), and a base 3.5L V6 (283 hp, 255 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praised the truck's improved fuel economy, ride quality, and interior comfort. Common dislikes included some issues with the new aluminum body construction and certain drivetrain components.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbocharger, loss of power, check engine light. This can be caused by oil starvation, bearing failure, or impeller damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected turbocharger(s). Inspect oil lines for blockages and ensure proper lubrication.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on which turbo and shop rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wastegate Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, poor boost control, check engine light. The wastegate may stick open or closed, leading to overboost or underboost conditions.
    * Solution: Replace the wastegate actuator or the entire turbocharger assembly if the actuator is integrated.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8 Coyote**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil levels, blue smoke from the exhaust, and the need to add oil frequently between oil changes. This issue is often linked to piston ring design or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution: In some cases, Ford has recommended replacing the pistons and rings with an updated design. In other cases, valve stem seals may be the culprit and need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knocking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Audible knocking or tapping sound, especially when cold starting. This can be related to piston slap or other internal engine wear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is critical to determine the exact cause. Could require engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $7,000+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or rough shifts between gears, a noticeable "clunk" sound during shifting.
    *   Solution: Some cases can be resolved with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling, or difficulty shifting into gear.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking, popping, or creaking sounds coming from the front suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps. This is often caused by worn ball joints, tie rod ends, or sway bar end links.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side, depending on which components need replacing.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **SYNC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, failure to connect to Bluetooth devices, unresponsive touchscreen.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. More serious issues may require replacing the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $500 - $1,200+ (for APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock, or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Aluminum Body Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion around the wheel wells, bed seams, and other areas where dissimilar metals meet. This can be accelerated by road salt and other environmental factors.
    *   Solution: Thorough cleaning and rust prevention treatments can slow the spread of corrosion. Severe cases may require panel replacement or body repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters not working or working intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heating element or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per seat
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof sticking, failing to open or close properly, or leaking.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks can sometimes resolve sticking issues. More serious issues may require replacing the sunroof motor or assembly.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford F-150, while innovative with its aluminum body, has exhibited several common issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the 5.0L V8 and turbocharger issues in the 3.5L EcoBoost, can be costly. Transmission problems and electrical glitches with the SYNC system also appear with some frequency. The severity and cost of these issues range from minor inconveniences to major repairs, making a thorough inspection and pre-purchase assessment essential. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, others can lead to significant repair bills, impacting the overall ownership experience.
