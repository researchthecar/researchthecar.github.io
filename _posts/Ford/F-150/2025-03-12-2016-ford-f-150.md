**Summary**

The 2016 Ford F-150 experiences several notable issues, particularly concerning the 3.5L EcoBoost engine and the 10-speed transmission. While the 2.7L EcoBoost and base 3.5L V6 appear relatively reliable, the 5.0L V8 can suffer from excessive oil consumption. Electrical glitches with the Sync 3 system and exterior issues such as tailgate latch failures also appear. The severity of these issues varies, but some (engine failure, transmission rebuild) can be quite costly to repair, potentially exceeding $3,000 - $10,000. Buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing a used 2016 F-150.
