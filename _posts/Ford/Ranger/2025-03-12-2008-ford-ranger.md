The 2008 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and affordability, making it a popular choice for those needing a practical work truck or a smaller alternative to full-size pickups. Engine options for the 2008 Ranger include a 2.3L inline-4 Duratec engine producing approximately 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L Cologne V6 engine generating around 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic depending on the engine. Owners appreciate the Ranger's compact size, ease of parking, and fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.3L engine), while some criticize its dated interior, limited cab space in the standard cab models, and relatively low power compared to newer trucks.
