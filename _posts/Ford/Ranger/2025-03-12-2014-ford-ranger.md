The 2014 Ford Ranger, available in Australia and other global markets, is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability, practicality, and off-road capability. The 2014 model came with several engine and transmission options. Engine options include a 2.2L Duratorq TDCi inline-4 diesel engine, a 2.5L Duratec inline-4 petrol engine, and a more powerful 3.2L Duratorq TDCi inline-5 diesel engine. The 2.2L diesel engine produced approximately 110-147 horsepower and 275-375 Nm of torque, varying based on specific tuning. Transmission choices generally consisted of a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 6-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine and market. Owners often praise the Ranger for its ruggedness, towing capacity, and relatively compact size compared to full-size trucks, making it easier to maneuver in urban environments. However, some common dislikes include the interior being a bit dated compared to newer trucks and the fuel economy, especially with the larger diesel engines. The truck has been known to be very reliable and rugged.

**Engine**

**2.2L Duratorq TDCi Inline-4 Diesel Engine**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common issues include failing fuel injectors, resulting in rough idling, misfires, poor fuel economy, and a noticeable loss of power. Symptoms can manifest gradually or suddenly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injectors is typically required, along with potentially cleaning the fuel system to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the number of injectors needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve malfunctions can lead to a buildup of carbon deposits, causing the valve to stick open or closed. This can result in poor engine performance, increased emissions, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve is the typical solution. In some cases, addressing the root cause of excessive carbon buildup may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L Duratorq TDCi Inline-5 Diesel Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can experience failures due to oil starvation, foreign object damage, or general wear and tear. Symptoms include a loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and a whining noise from the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger is generally required. It's also important to diagnose and address the cause of the failure to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The DPF can become clogged, especially in vehicles used primarily for short trips. This leads to reduced engine performance, warning lights, and potentially putting the engine into limp mode.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (either by a mechanic or through a long drive at highway speeds), cleaning, or replacement of the DPF may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complaints of harsh or jerky shifting between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by a software issue with the transmission control module (TCM). A reflash of the TCM software may resolve the issue. If the harsh shifting is still present, a full transmission replacement is needed
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+, $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping, especially during acceleration or when shifting gears, can occur with higher mileage Rangers.
    *   Solution: Transmission slipping is usually a sign of worn clutch packs, low fluid level, or internal damage. A transmission fluid flush and filter change may temporarily alleviate the issue, but a rebuild or replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $300+, $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the front suspension ball joints can result in clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints is required. It's advisable to replace them in pairs to ensure even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Wiring Harnesses**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Damaged or corroded wiring harnesses can lead to various electrical issues, including malfunctioning sensors, lights, and other electrical components.
    *   Solution: Inspection and repair or replacement of the damaged wiring harness sections are necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rusting of the undercarriage or chassis of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Removal of rust and coating with anti-corrosion spray
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Airbag Warning Light**
    * Description/Symptoms: The airbag warning light can come on due to a faulty sensor or connection in the airbag system.
    * Solution: The solution is to diagnose and fix the issue, which may require resetting the system, replacing the sensor, or repairing the wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Ranger, while generally reliable, can encounter several issues. Engine problems, particularly with the diesel variants, include injector failures, turbocharger problems, and DPF issues, which can be costly to repair. Transmission problems such as harsh shifting and slipping can also arise. Suspension components may experience wear and tear, necessitating replacements. Electrical gremlins and interior issues can occur. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly is essential to maintain the Ranger's performance and longevity.
