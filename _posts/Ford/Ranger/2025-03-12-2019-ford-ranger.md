The 2019 Ford Ranger marked the return of the Ranger to the North American market after an eight-year hiatus. It comes exclusively with a 2.3L EcoBoost inline-4 engine producing 270 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10R80 10-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate its fuel economy for a truck, its maneuverability compared to full-size trucks, and its updated technology. Common complaints include the sometimes rough shifting of the 10-speed transmission, some cheap-feeling interior materials, and limited rear seat space in the SuperCab configuration.

**Engine**

**2.3L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. This can be a sign of internal engine wear or leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is needed to determine the cause, which could range from faulty PCV valve to worn piston rings. A compression test can help determine the condition of the piston rings. Repairing or replacing the affected components, such as replacing the piston rings or cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to other EcoBoost engines, some 2.3L EcoBoost engines in the 2019 Ranger can experience cam phaser issues. Symptoms include a rattling noise at startup (especially when cold), rough idling, and potential loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chain, and associated components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10R80 10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can also manifest as slipping during acceleration or delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: A software reflash or update from Ford is the first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, inspection and potential replacement of valve body components or the entire valve body could be required. In some severe cases, a full transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reflash) - $4,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering when shifting or at highway speeds. Often noticeable when the torque converter locks/unlocks.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and refill (using the correct Mercon ULV fluid) can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, replacement of the torque converter may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (flush) - $1,500+ (torque converter)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 3 infotainment system can occasionally freeze, crash, or exhibit slow response times. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: A software update from Ford is the first step. If the issue persists, a hard reset of the system or replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (update) - $500+ (APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may fail to display an image, show a distorted image, or intermittently cut out.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. If the wiring is good, the camera itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (camera replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners in hotter climates have reported cracking of the dashboard material, especially around the instrument panel and center console.
    *   Solution: Dashboard replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Fabric/Stitching Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature wear or tearing of the seat fabric, or issues with the seat stitching coming undone.
    *   Solution: Seat repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford Ranger presents a mix of potential issues ranging from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs. The most concerning issues revolve around the engine (oil consumption and cam phasers) and the transmission (harsh shifting and shuddering). While not every Ranger will experience these issues, they are prevalent enough to warrant careful inspection and consideration before purchasing. The costs associated with these repairs can vary widely, but some issues can easily exceed $1,000. Overall, buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision.
