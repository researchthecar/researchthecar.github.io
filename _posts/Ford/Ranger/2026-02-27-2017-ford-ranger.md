### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Ford Ranger is a generally reliable pickup truck, particularly its diesel engine variants which, while robust, can occasionally face issues like turbocharger problems or DPF clogging, especially with higher mileage or inconsistent driving patterns. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can include torque converter problems. Suspension components like leaf springs and shocks are subject to wear but are generally durable. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain or sensor failures, are not uncommon as vehicles age. Overall, the Ranger offers good value for its capability, but owners should be aware of potential maintenance needs for its powertrain and suspension systems.
