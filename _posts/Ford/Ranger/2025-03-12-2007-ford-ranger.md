**Summary**

The 2007 Ford Ranger, while generally reliable, has some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly timing chain concerns in the 2.3L and thermostat housing leaks in the 4.0L, can be costly. Transmission issues, especially with the 5R55E automatic, can also lead to significant repair bills. Suspension issues, such as ball joint wear and leaf spring problems, are also common due to the age of the vehicle. Electrical problems, like blend door actuator failure, can impact comfort, and dashboard cracking is a common cosmetic concern. Rust is a major problem in regions that use road salt. Overall, while the Ranger is a capable truck, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor in the potential costs of repair. The severity and cost of these issues range from minor annoyances to more significant repairs, so a thorough pre-purchase inspection is recommended.
