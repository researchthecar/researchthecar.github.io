Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Ford Ranger, organized by category and configuration, following the requested format.

The 2021 Ford Ranger is a mid-size pickup truck known for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and strong towing capacity for its class. It is powered by a 2.3-liter EcoBoost inline-4 engine producing 270 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its size, making it easier to park and navigate in urban environments compared to full-size trucks. However, some find the interior materials and design to be somewhat dated compared to competitors and the ride quality can be stiff, especially on rough roads. The lack of a V6 or diesel engine option is also a common complaint.

**Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine misfires or hesitation, particularly during acceleration or when the engine is cold. This can manifest as a jerky feeling or a temporary loss of power.
    *   Solution: The issue could be related to faulty spark plugs, coil packs, or fuel injectors. Diagnosis is necessary to pinpoint the specific cause. Replacing the affected component(s) is the typical solution. A software update may be necessary.

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports exist regarding the 2.3L EcoBoost engine consuming more oil than expected between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: The cause of excessive oil consumption can vary. It may involve issues with piston rings, valve stem seals, or the PCV system. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source. Repair may involve replacing the affected components.
