**Introduction:**

The 1999 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck available in various configurations. It offers multiple engine and transmission options, including a 2.5L I4, a 3.0L V6, and a 4.0L V6. The vehicle is praised for its affordability, off-road capabilities, and practical design. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues.

**Engine**

**2.5L I4**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** Stretched or worn tensioner causes the timing chain to jump, resulting in engine damage. Symptoms include rattling noises, engine misfires, and loss of power. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner and timing chain. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+

**3.0L V6**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Leaking gasket causes vacuum leaks, reduced engine performance, and rough idling. Symptoms include engine misfires, poor fuel economy, and check engine light. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**4.0L V6**

* **Head Gasket Failure:** Deteriorated head gasket causes coolant and oil leaks, engine overheating, and white smoke from the exhaust. Symptoms include coolant loss, overheating, and engine misfires. Solution: Replace the head gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Clutch Failure:** Worn clutch disc or pressure plate causes difficulty shifting gears, grinding noises, and slipping. Symptoms include shuddering during acceleration and difficulty engaging gears. Solution: Replace the clutch assembly. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Solenoid Failure:** Malfunctioning solenoid prevents proper gear engagement, causing delayed or harsh shifts. Symptoms include rough shifting, slipping gears, and check engine light. Solution: Replace the faulty solenoid. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Failure:** Overload or excessive wear causes leaf springs to break or sag, affecting handling and stability. Symptoms include uneven ride height, difficult steering, and rattling noises. Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** Worn brushes or diodes cause the alternator to fail, resulting in insufficient charging of the battery. Symptoms include flickering lights, dim headlights, and a dead battery. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500

**Interior**

* **Heater Core Failure:** Leaking heater core causes coolant to enter the passenger compartment, resulting in a sweet smell and fogged-up windows. Symptoms include coolant loss, overheating, and a misty interior. Solution: Replace the heater core. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000

* **Dashboard Cracking:** Excessive sun exposure or temperature changes cause the dashboard to crack. Symptoms include visible cracks on the dashboard surface. Solution: No fix available, can be covered with a dashboard cover. Estimated Cost to Fix: N/A

* **Power Window Failure:** Malfunctioning window motor or switch prevents the power windows from operating. Symptoms include difficulty or inability to raise or lower windows. Solution: Replace the faulty window motor or switch. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400

**Summary:**

The 1999 Ford Ranger is a reliable vehicle, but like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but most are relatively affordable to fix. The timing chain tensioner failure on the 2.5L engine is one of the most serious issues, but it can be prevented by regular maintenance. The other issues are generally minor and unlikely to cause major problems.
