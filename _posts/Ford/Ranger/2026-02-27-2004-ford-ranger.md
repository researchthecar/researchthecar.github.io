### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford Ranger is a generally dependable compact truck, particularly for its age. Common issues tend to be concentrated in specific engine variants (like head gasket issues on the 3.0L V6 and spark plug blowout on the 4.0L V6) and automatic transmission components such as torque converters and solenoids. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also wear over time. Electrical issues, primarily with the alternator and power window regulators, are also noted. Exterior rust, especially on the frame and wheel wells, is a concern for trucks in rust-prone areas. Interior wear and tear, such as blower motor failure and upholstery damage, are also reported. Despite these points, many Rangers continue to serve reliably with proper maintenance and addressing these known issues.
