The 2012 Ford Ranger marked the final year of this generation in the North American market. It was offered with two engine choices: a 2.3L Duratec I4 producing 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L Cologne V6 generating 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. The 2.3L was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 4.0L was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Ranger for its compact size, affordability, and reliability. However, some disliked its dated interior, lack of modern features, and relatively poor fuel economy compared to newer trucks.

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford Ranger, while generally reliable, has its share of common issues. The engine problems, especially the timing chain rattle in the 4.0L V6, can be costly to fix. Transmission issues can also be a significant expense. Suspension and electrical problems are generally less severe but should still be addressed promptly. Rust is a major concern, particularly in regions with harsh winters. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
