The 2020 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck that offers two engine options: a 2.3L EcoBoost I-4 and a 3.0L Power Stroke V6. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Ranger is praised for its off-road capabilities, payload and towing capacity, and advanced technology features.
