The 2011 Ford Ranger marked the final year of its generation in the North American market, offering a compact and practical pickup truck experience. Available engine options included a 2.3L Duratec I4 engine producing 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L Cologne V6 engine producing 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual transmission and a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Ranger's maneuverability, affordability, and reliability as a work truck. Common dislikes include its outdated design, limited interior space, and lower fuel economy compared to some newer trucks.

**Summary**

The 2011 Ford Ranger, while a reliable and affordable truck, exhibits several common issues. Engine problems range from timing chain and thermostat housing issues to sensor failures, with costs varying from a few hundred to over a thousand dollars. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can be costly to resolve. Suspension problems like sagging leaf springs can affect ride quality. Electrical issues like blend door actuator and instrument cluster failures also arise. Finally, rust on the exterior can be a concern, especially in colder climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission overhauls or extensive rust repair, can be quite costly.
