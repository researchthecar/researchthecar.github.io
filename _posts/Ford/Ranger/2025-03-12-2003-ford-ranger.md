The 2003 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and affordability. Engine options included a 2.3L inline-four cylinder (135 hp, 153 lb-ft torque), a 3.0L V6 (154 hp, 180 lb-ft torque), and a 4.0L V6 (207 hp, 238 lb-ft torque). Transmission options were typically a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often praise the Ranger for its compact size, maneuverability, and fuel efficiency, especially with the smaller engines. Common complaints include a relatively basic interior, limited rear seat space in extended cab models, and some known reliability issues related to specific engines and components as listed below.

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford Ranger, while generally reliable, has its share of potential issues. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Engine problems like timing chain issues on the 4.0L V6 and intake manifold leaks on the 3.0L V6 can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, especially with the automatic, can also be expensive. Rust is a significant concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. Electrical and suspension issues are generally less expensive but can still be inconvenient. When considering a 2003 Ranger, it's crucial to thoroughly inspect the vehicle for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs.
