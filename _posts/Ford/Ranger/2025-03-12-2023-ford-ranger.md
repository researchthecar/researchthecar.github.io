The 2023 Ford Ranger marks the first year of the new generation of the mid-size pickup truck. It boasts updated styling, technology, and performance. While generally well-received, some owners have reported a range of issues. The standard engine is a 2.3L EcoBoost inline-4 producing 270 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. A 3.0L EcoBoost V6 producing 405 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque is available as well, which is exclusive to the Raptor model. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Ranger's improved ride quality, modern interior, and off-road capabilities, while some criticisms include the higher price point compared to previous generations and some reported electronic glitches.
