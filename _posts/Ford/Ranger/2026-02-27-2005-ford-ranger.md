### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford Ranger is a generally robust truck, particularly favored for its mechanical simplicity and durability. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as cooling system leaks and intake manifold gasket failures on the 2.3L engine, and head gasket or timing chain concerns on the V6 variants. Automatic transmission issues, particularly with torque converters and solenoids, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear over time, and frame rust is a concern in corrosive environments. Electrical issues like alternator failure and window regulator problems are not uncommon. Despite these points, with proper maintenance and attention to these specific areas, the 2005 Ranger can remain a reliable vehicle.
