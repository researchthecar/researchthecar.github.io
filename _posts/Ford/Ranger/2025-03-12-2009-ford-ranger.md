The 2009 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability and affordability, appealing to those seeking a practical workhorse or a fuel-efficient daily driver. Available engine options included a 2.3L Duratec I4 producing 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L Cologne V6 generating 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque.
