The 2018 Ford Ranger marked the return of the Ranger nameplate to the North American market after a hiatus. It came equipped with a 2.3L EcoBoost inline-4 engine, producing 270 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Ranger for its fuel economy, maneuverability, and modern technology. Some common dislikes included a somewhat firm ride and limited rear seat space compared to some competitors.

**Engine**

**2.3L EcoBoost Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, blue smoke from the exhaust, and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: The fix varies depending on the cause. Some owners have had success with switching to a different brand of oil or a thicker oil viscosity. More severe cases may require replacing the PCV valve or piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV valve replacement) - $3000+ (Piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of turbocharger failures have surfaced. Symptoms include a loss of power, strange noises coming from the engine (whining or whistling), and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears (1st to 3rd). Slipping between gears or delayed engagement is also reported.
    *   Solution: A software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM) might resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250 (Software Update) - $800+ (Valve Body) - $3000+ (Transmission Rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common complaint is a noticeable squeaking noise coming from the rear leaf spring suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Applying lubricant (grease or silicone-based) to the leaf spring bushings and contact points may temporarily alleviate the squeaking. In some cases, replacing the leaf spring bushings or the entire leaf spring assembly may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50 (Lubricant) - $100 - $300 (Bushing Replacement) - $500 - $1000+ (Leaf Spring Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

    *   Solution: Performing a system reset or software update may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Typically covered under warranty or free with over-the-air updates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the backup camera not working properly, displaying a blank screen, or showing a distorted image.
    *   Solution: Checking the camera wiring and connections. If the wiring is fine, the camera unit itself may need to be replaced.

    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and tightening any loose screws or fasteners. Applying foam padding or felt tape to areas where components are rubbing together.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ (Depending on the complexity of the fix)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Ford Ranger, while a welcome return to the mid-size truck market, has its share of common issues. The most prominent concern is the reported harsh shifting/slipping of the 10-speed transmission and the 2.3L EcoBoost engine consuming excess oil. While the reported issues are not necessarily widespread, they represent potential problems for prospective buyers to be aware of. Repair costs vary widely depending on the severity of the issue, ranging from minor fixes to significant engine or transmission repairs. It is important to note that many of these issues are not necessarily present in every vehicle, and a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing any used vehicle.
