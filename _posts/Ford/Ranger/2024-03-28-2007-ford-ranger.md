**Introduction:**

The 2007 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck offered with several engine and transmission options. The base engine is a 2.3L inline-four that produces 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. A 3.0L V6 is also available and generates 154 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, while a 4-speed automatic transmission is optional.

Owners appreciate the Ranger's affordability, compact size, and off-road capabilities. However, it has been criticized for its cramped interior, lack of modern amenities, and poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-Four**

* **Head Gasket Failure:** Blowing or leaking head gaskets can lead to overheating, coolant leaks, and engine damage. The replacement cost is estimated to be $1,000 - $1,500+.
* **Timing Belt Failure:** The timing belt, which synchronizes the movement of the crankshaft and camshaft, can break if not properly maintained. This can cause catastrophic engine damage. The recommended replacement interval is every 60,000 miles, and the cost ranges from $500 - $800+.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket, which seals the intake manifold to the cylinder head, can fail and cause vacuum leaks, rough idling, and decreased performance. The repair cost is estimated to be $350 - $650+.

**3.0L V6**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** The valve cover gasket, which seals the valve cover to the cylinder head, can leak and cause oil leaks. The replacement cost is typically between $250 - $450+.
* **Spark Plug Tube Leak:** The spark plug tubes, which house the spark plugs, can develop leaks and allow oil to enter the combustion chamber. This can lead to engine misfires and decreased performance. The repair cost is estimated to be $500 - $800+.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Failure:** The clutch, which engages and disengages the transmission from the engine, can wear out over time and need replacement. The cost to replace the clutch ranges from $500 - $1,200+.
* **Shifter Problems:** The shifter may become loose or difficult to operate due to worn or damaged components. The repair cost is typically between $200 - $500+.

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Solenoid Failure:** The transmission solenoid, which controls the shifting of gears, can fail and cause transmission issues. The replacement cost ranges from $350 - $700+.
* **Overheating:** The transmission can overheat due to insufficient fluid or a faulty cooler. Symptoms include slipping gears and a burning smell. The repair cost depends on the cause.

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Failure:** The leaf springs, which support the vehicle's weight, can break or sag over time. This can cause uneven wear on the tires and affect the vehicle's handling. The replacement cost ranges from $500 - $1,000+ per spring.
* **Shock Absorber Failure:** The shock absorbers, which control the vehicle's ride quality, can wear out or leak. This can lead to a rough ride and reduced stability. The replacement cost is typically between $250 - $500+ per shock.

**Electrical**

* **Ignition Switch Failure:** The ignition switch, which allows the vehicle to start and stop, can fail and prevent the vehicle from starting. The replacement cost is estimated to be $200 - $400+.
* **Electrical Wiring Issues:** The electrical wiring harness can develop shorts or become damaged, leading to various electrical problems. The repair cost varies depending on the extent of the damage.
