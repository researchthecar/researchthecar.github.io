The 2006 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability, affordability, and practicality. It's generally well-regarded for its simple design and ease of maintenance. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. Available engine options for the 2006 Ranger include a 2.3L Duratec inline-4 producing around 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque and a 4.0L Cologne V6, generating approximately 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are primarily a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Ranger's fuel efficiency (especially with the 2.3L), its compact size making it easy to maneuver, and its utility for light-duty tasks. Common dislikes include the basic interior, limited cabin space (especially in the regular cab), and the age of the design.

**Engine**

**2.3L Duratec I4**

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough running, stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup.  Can lead to timing chain skipping and severe engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, tensioner, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.0L Cologne V6**

*   **Thermostat Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak near the thermostat housing, overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the thermostat housing and gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leak**

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (5R55E)**

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slips between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal damage to the transmission.  Fluid flush and solenoid replacement might solve the issue. In more severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $250 (solenoid replacement) - $1500-$3500 (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially during light acceleration or when the torque converter locks up.
    *   Solution: Some success has been reported with a transmission fluid flush using a specific friction modifier additive. However, it could indicate a failing torque converter requiring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush with additive) - $500 - $1000+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, loose steering.

**Summary**

The 2006 Ford Ranger, while generally reliable, exhibits several common issues. Engine problems range from relatively minor sensor failures to more significant concerns like timing chain tensioner issues in the 2.3L. The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience slipping and shuddering. Suspension problems, particularly ball joint and leaf spring wear, are also common. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster issues, can be frustrating. Rust is a significant concern in certain climates. The severity and cost of repairs vary greatly, with some issues being relatively inexpensive to fix, while others, such as transmission rebuilds or rust repair, can be quite costly. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect any 2006 Ranger they are considering purchasing.
