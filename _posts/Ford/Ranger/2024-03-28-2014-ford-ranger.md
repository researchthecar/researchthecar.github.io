## 2014 Ford Ranger

The 2014 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck that comes with a choice of two engines: a 2.5-liter inline-four or a 3.2-liter inline-five. Both engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, and the Ranger comes in both rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive configurations. Despite its compact size, the Ranger offers a roomy interior and a comfortable ride, making it a popular choice for both work and play. However, like all vehicles, the Ranger does have some common issues, and these are broken down into the following categories:

**Engine**

**2.5-Liter Inline-Four**

* **Intake Manifold Failure:** The intake manifold can crack, causing a loss of power and engine stalling. The solution is to replace the intake manifold, which typically costs around $500 - $800. **Recall: N/A**
* **Timing Chain Failure:** The timing chain can stretch or break, causing the engine to jump time and potentially leading to catastrophic engine damage. The solution is to replace the timing chain and related components, which can cost upwards of $1,500. **Recall: N/A**

**3.2-Liter Inline-Five**

* **Exhaust Manifold Leak:** The exhaust manifold gasket can fail, causing an exhaust leak. The solution is to replace the exhaust manifold gasket, which typically costs around $300 - $500. **Recall: N/A**
* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail, resulting in a loss of power and increased fuel consumption. The solution is to replace the turbocharger, which can cost upwards of $2,000. **Recall: N/A**

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Transmission Slippage:** The transmission may slip or shudder during gear changes, indicating a need for transmission repair. The solution is to replace the transmission fluid and filter, and if that does not resolve the issue, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced, which can cost upwards of $3,000. **Recall: N/A**

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Breakage:** The rear leaf springs can break, causing the rear of the truck to sag. The solution is to replace the leaf springs, which typically costs around $500 - $800 per leaf spring. **Recall: N/A**
* **Shock Absorber Failure:** The shock absorbers can fail, causing the ride quality to deteriorate and the truck to feel bouncy. The solution is to replace the shock absorbers, which typically costs around $200 - $400 per shock absorber. **Recall: N/A**

**Electrical**

* **Electrical Shorts:** Various electrical shorts can occur throughout the vehicle, causing issues such as flickering lights, dead batteries, or power window failures. The solution is to diagnose and repair the short, which can vary in cost depending on the location and severity of the short. **Recall: N/A**
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, leading to a loss of electrical power and potentially leaving the driver stranded. The solution is to replace the alternator, which typically costs around $500 - $800. **Recall: N/A**

**Exterior**

* **Headlight Condensation:** Moisture can accumulate inside the headlight assemblies, causing condensation and impaired visibility. The solution is to replace the headlights, which typically costs around $300 - $500 per headlight. **Recall: N/A**
* **Tailgate Lock Failure:** The tailgate lock can fail, preventing the tailgate from being opened or closed. The solution is to replace the tailgate lock, which typically costs around $200 - $300. **Recall: N/A**

**Interior**

* **Heater Core Leak:** The heater core can leak, causing coolant to leak into the cabin and a musty odor. The solution is to replace the heater core, which typically costs around $500 - $800. **Recall: N/A**
* **Cruise Control Failure:** The cruise control system may fail, preventing the driver from using cruise control. The solution is to diagnose and repair the issue, which can vary in cost depending on the source of the failure. **Recall: N/A**

**Summary**

Overall, the 2014 Ford Ranger is a reliable pickup truck, but like all vehicles, it does have some common issues. The most severe and costly issues tend to be engine and transmission related, but these issues are relatively rare. The majority of issues are less severe and less costly to repair, such as electrical shorts or interior component failures. Regular maintenance and repairs can help to prevent or delay the occurrence of these issues, and overall, the Ranger is a good choice for those in need of a compact pickup truck.
