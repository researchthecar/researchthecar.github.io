### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford Ranger is a generally reliable compact pickup truck. Its most common issues stem from age and mileage, particularly concerning leaks in the engine (intake manifold gaskets, coolant hoses) and wear in the suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs. Automatic transmission issues often involve solenoids or the torque converter. Electrical components like the alternator can also fail. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Despite these potential problems, the Ranger's straightforward design makes it a practical choice for those seeking a durable and repairable truck, with most common repairs being moderately priced.
