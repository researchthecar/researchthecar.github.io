### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford Ranger is generally considered a reliable truck, with most owners reporting satisfaction. The gasoline 2.5L Duratec engine and manual transmission variants appear to be particularly robust, with minimal reported technical issues. The diesel 3.2L Duratorq engine, while powerful, has a few more documented concerns, primarily related to the turbocharger and EGR valve, which are not uncommon for diesel powertrains. Automatic transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, can occur but are often resolvable with maintenance or minor repairs. Electrical gremlins like battery drain or sensor failures are present but not overwhelmingly prevalent. Overall, the 2016 Ranger offers solid dependability, especially when properly maintained.
