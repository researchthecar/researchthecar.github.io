The 2016 Ford Ranger, primarily sold outside of North America at the time, is a mid-size pickup truck known for its reliability, practicality, and off-road capabilities. Common engine options for the 2016 Ranger include a range of Duratorq diesel engines and some gasoline options, the most popular being the 2.2L Duratorq TDCi four-cylinder diesel engine (148 hp and 277 lb-ft of torque). Other engine options for the 2016 Ford Ranger can include the 3.2L Duratorq TDCi five-cylinder diesel engine (197 hp and 347 lb-ft of torque), the 2.5L Duratec I4 gasoline engine. It is also offered with a range of manual and automatic transmissions, depending on the engine and market. Owners often praise the Ranger's toughness, fuel efficiency (for diesel models), and compact size, making it suitable for both urban environments and rough terrain. However, some common complaints include a relatively basic interior compared to newer trucks, limited rear passenger space in some cab configurations, and engine noise.

**Engine**

**2.2L Duratorq TDCi**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, rough idling, black smoke from the exhaust, and the engine management light illuminating on the dashboard. This can be caused by a buildup of carbon deposits restricting the valve's movement.
    *   Solution: Replacing the EGR valve. In some cases, cleaning the valve might temporarily resolve the issue, but replacement is typically recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, poor fuel economy, misfires, excessive smoke, and a noticeable knocking sound from the engine. Injectors can become clogged or fail electronically.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L Duratorq TDCi**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling sound from the engine bay, increased oil consumption, and black smoke. The turbocharger bearings or seals can fail, leading to decreased boost pressure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the turbocharger. In some cases, a rebuild might be possible, but replacement is generally more reliable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant leaks around the engine. Common leak points include the water pump, hoses, and radiator.
    *   Solution: Identifying and replacing the leaking component, such as the water pump, hoses, or radiator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Duratec I4**

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, and difficulty starting. The IAC valve controls the amount of air entering the engine at idle, and it can become clogged or malfunction.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Manual Transmission (Specific Type Unspecified)**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, and a high clutch pedal engagement point. The clutch disc can wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Synchro Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding noise when shifting gears, especially into 2nd or 3rd. The synchros help to match the speeds of the gears during shifting, and they can wear out over time.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Automatic Transmission (Specific Type Unspecified)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, especially when cold. This can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn valve body components, or solenoid issues.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body or solenoids may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, poor acceleration, and stalling. The torque converter is responsible for transmitting power from the engine to the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, particularly in the rear, and a harsher ride. The leaf springs can weaken over time, especially with heavy use.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and poor handling. The shock absorbers dampen the movement of the suspension.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, a warning light on the dashboard, and difficulty starting. The alternator is responsible for charging the battery and powering the electrical system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery keeps going dead, even after being fully charged. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Identifying and repairing the source of the parasitic draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts. This is more common in areas with harsh winter weather or coastal environments.
    *   Solution: Rust removal and treatment, followed by protective coating. In severe cases, welding repairs may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning does not blow cold air. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a clogged condenser.
    *   Solution: Repairing the refrigerant leak, replacing the compressor, or cleaning the condenser.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows that operate slowly or fail to operate at all. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, switch, or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor, switch, or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford Ranger, while generally a reliable vehicle, can experience issues with its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, exterior, and interior. Engine-related issues, particularly with the EGR valve, injectors (2.2L), turbocharger (3.2L), and coolant leaks (3.2L), can lead to significant repair costs. Transmission problems like clutch failure (manual), synchro wear (manual), harsh shifting (automatic), and torque converter failure (automatic) also pose a potential financial burden. Rust, especially on the undercarriage, is a concern in certain climates. Suspension issues are fairly common, but not that severe. While many of these problems are not catastrophic, they should be considered when evaluating a used 2016 Ford Ranger. Depending on the severity, some issues may run a higher cost, while issues like IAC valve replacement will be a lower cost,
