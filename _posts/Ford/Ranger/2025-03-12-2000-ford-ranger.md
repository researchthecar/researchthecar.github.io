The 2000 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability, affordability, and versatility. It was available with three engine options: a 2.5L inline-4 (I4) producing 119 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L Vulcan V6 generating 150 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L Cologne V6 outputting 160 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque in early models, and later upgraded to 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Ranger's compact size for city driving and its ruggedness for light off-road use. Common complaints revolve around its relatively basic interior, limited cabin space (especially in standard cab models), and potential for rust in certain climates.
