Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Ford Ranger, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration, following your specified format.

The 2022 Ford Ranger is a mid-size pickup truck known for its ruggedness and capability. In the North American market, it comes standard with a 2.3-liter EcoBoost inline-4 engine producing 270 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. It is paired exclusively with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Ranger's maneuverability, fuel economy for its class, and user-friendly technology. Common dislikes include a somewhat dated interior design and ride quality that can be firm, especially on rough roads.

**Engine**

**2.3L EcoBoost Inline-4**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report instances of engine hesitation during acceleration or even stalling, especially at lower speeds or after cold starts. This may or may not cause a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Dealerships have addressed this issue by re-flashing the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) with updated software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Typically covered under the factory warranty. If not under warranty, diagnosis and re-flashing may cost $100 - $200+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: There have been rare reports of turbocharger failure or issues such as excessive whine or lack of boost. Symptoms include a noticeable decrease in power and/or unusual noises from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger is typically required, and the dealer should check the turbocharger inlet and outlet lines for any obstructions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+ depending on the shop and if additional components are needed (gaskets, lines, etc.).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced harsh shifting, particularly between lower gears (1st to 3rd), or a noticeable "clunk" sound during gear changes. This is most noticeable at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: A software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and fill may also help. In rarer, more severe instances, valve body replacement has been necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100 - $200+. Fluid flush: $200 - $400. Valve body replacement: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A delay in engagement when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse is sometimes reported. This may be accompanied by a slight hesitation before the vehicle moves.
    *   Solution: Again, a software update of the TCM is the first step. More serious cases may indicate internal transmission issues requiring further diagnosis.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100 - $200+. More serious issues can range from $500 for minor repairs to $3,000+ for a full rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 3 infotainment system can occasionally freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This includes issues with the touchscreen, navigation, and connectivity features.
    *   Solution: Performing a "soft reset" of the system (holding the power and forward seek buttons) is the first step. Software updates from Ford can also address these issues. In rare cases, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: Generally free at the dealer or via over-the-air updates. APIM replacement: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent issues with the backup camera, such as a distorted image, black screen, or complete failure to display, have been reported.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connection for corrosion or damage. Software updates have addressed some camera issues. In some instances, the camera itself needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: Generally free. Camera replacement: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Squeaking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported rattling or squeaking noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or center console. These are more noticeable on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the noise and applying felt tape or padding to the affected area is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the complexity of the repair. Could be a DIY fix with minimal cost, or $100 - $300+ at a shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford Ranger generally presents with relatively minor issues. The most common complaints revolve around the transmission's shifting behavior and occasional electrical glitches with the infotainment system. Engine problems appear less frequent, but hesitation/stalling should be investigated if experienced. While the potential costs of repairs can vary, software updates often address many of the reported issues. The majority of the problems appear to be of low to moderate severity.
