The 2002 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability, affordability, and practicality. Available engine options included a 2.3L inline-four, a 3.0L V6, and a 4.0L V6. The 4.0L V6 produced around 207 horsepower and 238 lb-ft of torque. The Ranger was generally liked for its compact size, ease of parking, and decent fuel economy for a truck, but disliked for its somewhat dated interior and limited passenger space in the regular cab configuration.
