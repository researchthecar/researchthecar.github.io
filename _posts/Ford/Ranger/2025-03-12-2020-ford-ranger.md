The 2020 Ford Ranger marked the second year of the Ranger's reintroduction to the North American market. It came equipped with a 2.3L EcoBoost inline-4 engine producing 270 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the Ranger for its fuel efficiency, maneuverability compared to full-size trucks, and its payload capacity. Common criticisms include the sometimes-clunky 10-speed transmission, a less-refined interior compared to some competitors, and a relatively firm ride.

**Engine**

**2.3L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as a low oil warning light, visible smoke from the exhaust, or a noticeable drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a revised PCV valve or updated engine calibration can help. More severe cases may require internal engine repairs, such as piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on severity and necessary repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the turbocharger, including unusual noises (whining or screeching), reduced power, or turbo failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the turbocharger assembly. Check for boost leaks and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R80)**

*   **Harsh or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 10R80 transmission is known to exhibit rough or unpredictable shifting, including hard shifts, slipping, or reluctance to downshift. This can be most noticeable at lower speeds or during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission software reflash/reprogramming is often the first step. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or internal transmission repairs might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $4,000+ (depending on the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip when attempting to accelerate, leading to a delay in power delivery and a feeling of the engine revving without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: This can be due to low transmission fluid levels, worn clutch packs, or issues with the valve body. A transmission fluid flush might help in some cases, but often requires more extensive repairs or a replacement transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+ (depending on the repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Squeaking/Rattling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported squeaking or rattling noises emanating from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the leaf springs, bushings, and shock absorbers. Lubricating or replacing worn components can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (SYNC 3) can sometimes freeze, crash, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reset or software update.
    *   Solution: Performing a master reset of the SYNC system. If the issue persists, a software update from the dealer or replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for a reset) - $1,000+ (for APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may fail to display an image, show a distorted image, or intermittently work.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. If the connections are good, the camera module itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Paint Peeling/Premature Rusting (Early Build)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some early production 2020 Rangers have exhibited paint peeling or premature rusting, particularly in areas prone to road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Body shop repair and repainting. Application of rustproofing treatments.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking (Exposure to Extreme Heat)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In regions with high temperatures and intense sunlight, some owners have experienced cracking or warping of the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard. Using a sunshade can help prevent this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rattling Noises from Interior Trim Pieces**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises originating from the interior trim panels, particularly in the door panels or dashboard.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the rattle and tightening or securing the loose trim pieces. Applying felt tape or foam padding can also help dampen vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (DIY) - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford Ranger, while generally a reliable truck, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most prevalent relate to the 10-speed transmission's shifting behavior and potential issues with the engine's oil consumption or turbocharger. Electrical problems with the infotainment system and backup camera are also noted. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission work, can be costly. Be sure to inspect a used Ranger thoroughly and address any potential issues before purchasing.
