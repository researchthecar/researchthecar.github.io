Alright, here's a breakdown of potential issues reported for the 2024 Ford F-650, formatted for your website. Please note that as a large language model, my information is based on available data and user reports which may be limited for such a recent model year. Also, as time goes on and more data is collected, the specific issues reported with the 2024 Ford F-650 may change. Always encourage users to perform thorough independent research when making vehicle purchase decisions.

The 2024 Ford F-650 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications. It comes with several engine options including a 7.3L V8 gasoline engine that produces 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine with varying power outputs depending on the configuration. These engines are typically paired with a Ford TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often appreciate the F-650 for its robust build and towing capacity, while common complaints revolve around its size and maneuverability, particularly in urban environments.

**Engine**

**7.3L V8 Gas Engine**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel Engine**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, black smoke from exhaust, reduced power, diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to fuel injector performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). It's recommended to replace all injectors on the affected bank for optimal performance. Recalibration of the engine control module (ECM) may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per injector, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, DPF warning light illumination, potential engine shutdown due to excessive backpressure.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF via a scan tool, or replacement of the DPF if cleaning is ineffective or the filter is severely damaged. Addressing the underlying cause of excessive soot production (e.g., faulty sensors, injector issues) is crucial to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Forced regeneration: $100 - $300. DPF replacement: $2000 - $4000+, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky gear changes, noticeable delays when shifting between gears (especially from Park/Neutral to Drive/Reverse), transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of transmission fluid level and condition is the first step. Fluid flush and filter change can resolve minor issues. More severe cases might require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid change: $200 - $400. Valve body replacement: $800 - $2000+. Transmission rebuild: $3000 - $6000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at highway speeds, especially under light load. Stall/near stall when coming to a stop, or when shifting into gear from park.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Check transmission fluid for contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+ including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower than normal, uneven ride height, clunking noises from the suspension when driving over bumps. Visual inspection reveals cracks or deformation in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected leaf spring(s). Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery overnight or after short periods of inactivity, difficulty starting the engine, dimming headlights.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of parasitic drain using a multimeter. Common culprits include faulty modules (e.g., infotainment system, body control module), aftermarket accessories, or wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Depends on the source of the drain. Could range from a simple fuse replacement ($5 - $20) to module replacement ($500 - $2000+).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (ABS, TPMS, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights illuminated on the dashboard (ABS, TPMS, etc.), inaccurate readings from sensors (e.g., tire pressure, wheel speed), potential impact on vehicle performance and safety systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific sensor issue using a scan tool. Replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion Issues (Frame/Body)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame, undercarriage, and body panels, particularly in areas exposed to road salt or harsh weather conditions.
    *   Solution: Thorough inspection and treatment of affected areas. Removal of rust, application of rust converter, and protective coating. Severe cases may require welding or panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the extent of the damage. Minor surface rust: $100 - $500. Extensive corrosion: $1000 - $5000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: System freezing, screen blackouts, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system reset, or replacement of the infotainment unit if the problem persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $0 - $100 (if performed by the dealer). Infotainment unit replacement: $500 - $2000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Ford F-650, while valued for its power and towing capabilities, may present owners with some challenges. Engine issues, particularly with the 6.7L diesel, can be expensive to address. Transmission issues may occur, especially with the 6-speed automatic, as well as electrical and corrosion issues. The severity and cost of these problems can vary widely, emphasizing the importance of regular maintenance and prompt diagnosis of any unusual symptoms. As a newer model, information is limited, but potential buyers should research known issues and consider extended warranties for increased peace of mind.
