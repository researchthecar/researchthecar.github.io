**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The aluminum cylinder heads are prone to spark plug thread failure. This can result in a spark plug being ejected from the engine, causing a misfire, loud popping noise, and potential damage to the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with a thread repair kit (like Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the repair method and if DIY or professional.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks can develop in the plastic intake manifold, leading to vacuum leaks and rough running/misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L V8**
