### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Ford Econoline Wagon demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly concerning its core mechanical components. The V8 and V10 engines are known for their power and longevity, though specific issues like spark plug blowout on the V10 and 4.6L, and camshaft phaser problems on the 5.4L, have been noted. Transmissions, while generally robust, can experience issues with torque converters or solenoids, especially with higher mileage. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, as expected for a work-oriented vehicle. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, the Econoline is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be aware of these potential repair areas and perform regular maintenance to ensure continued service.
