### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Ford Econoline Wagon demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly for its intended purpose as a work vehicle. The V8 engines, while robust, can be prone to specific issues like spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks, especially the older Triton designs. Transmission reliability is generally good, though older 4-speed units may experience torque converter shudder or slipping. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the vehicle's load-carrying nature. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and wiring corrosion are not uncommon with age. Rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, with diligent maintenance and attention to these known potential issues, the 2011 Econoline Wagon remains a dependable choice.
