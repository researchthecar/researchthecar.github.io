### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Ford Econoline Wagon is a generally reliable vehicle, especially its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The most frequently reported issues tend to be related to the Triton V8 engines, particularly spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks, and potential torque converter or solenoid issues in the automatic transmissions. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also wear over time due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and window regulators are not uncommon. While rust can be a concern on older models, especially in harsh climates, the overall mechanical integrity of the Econoline remains a strong point for those seeking a durable, functional van.
