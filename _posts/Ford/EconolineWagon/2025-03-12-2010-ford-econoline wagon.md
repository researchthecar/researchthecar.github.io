The 2010 Ford Econoline Wagon, also known as the E-Series, is a full-size van known for its reliability and utility, making it a popular choice for commercial use and large families. For the 2010 model year, engine options included the 4.6L Triton V8, producing around 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, and the more powerful 5.4L Triton V8, rated at approximately 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Econoline's spacious interior and robust build, but common complaints often revolve around fuel economy and aging components. Many owners note that the van is reliable, but the cost of maintenance can become high as these vehicles age.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs are prone to seizing in the cylinder head, often resulting in breakage during removal. This can lead to significant downtime and repair costs.
    *   Solution: Use specialized extraction tools or penetrating oil to loosen the plugs before attempting removal. Sometimes, the cylinder heads must be removed and professionally repaired if a plug cannot be extracted.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the severity and the need for head removal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the plastic intake manifold, leading to vacuum leaks and rough running conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, the 5.4L engine also suffers from spark plug seizing and breakage during removal. The two-piece spark plug design is particularly problematic.
    *   Solution: Use specialized extraction tools or penetrating oil to loosen the plugs before attempting removal. Sometimes, the cylinder heads must be removed and professionally repaired if a plug cannot be extracted.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the severity and the need for head removal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford Econoline Wagon, while generally reliable, exhibits some common issues primarily related to its aging components. Engine issues, particularly spark plug breakage and cam phaser problems in the 5.4L, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, while not universally reported, can also lead to significant expenses. Suspension and electrical issues are also common. While most issues are not considered safety critical, the cost to repair can be high, especially on engine and transmission related problems. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these potential issues and budget accordingly.
