The 2012 Ford Econoline Wagon, also known as the E-Series, is a full-size van renowned for its spaciousness, durability, and practicality. It was offered with a few engine options including a 4.6L V8 producing 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, a 5.4L V8 producing 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.8L V10 producing 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. All engine options were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Econoline's robust build, cargo capacity, and suitability for commercial use or conversion into camper vans. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride quality, and relatively outdated technology compared to newer vans on the market.

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford Econoline Wagon is a capable and reliable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine issues like spark plug thread failure and, in the case of the 5.4L V8, camshaft phaser problems can be costly to repair. Suspension issues and rust are also common concerns. While some of the issues, such as spark plug thread repairs, can be relatively inexpensive if caught early, others, like engine rebuilds or extensive rust repair, can be significant expenses. Regular maintenance and inspections can help identify and address these issues before they become major problems.
