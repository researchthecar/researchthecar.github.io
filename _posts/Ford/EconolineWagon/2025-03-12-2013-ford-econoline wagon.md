The 2013 Ford Econoline Wagon, also known as the E-Series, is a full-size van that's known for its durability and practicality. It was available with a few engine options: a 4.6L Triton V8 producing 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, a 5.4L Triton V8 delivering 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.8L Triton V10 producing 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the E-Series for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design, which made it easy to maintain and repair. Common complaints include its outdated design, poor fuel economy, and cumbersome handling compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**
*   **Spark Plugs Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4.6L Triton engine is known for spark plugs seizing in the cylinder heads. During spark plug replacement, the plugs can break off inside the head, requiring specialized extraction tools or head removal. Symptoms include difficulty removing spark plugs, the sound of the plug breaking, and potential engine misfires if the broken plug is not properly removed.
    *   Solution: Use penetrating oil and carefully work the plugs back and forth. If a plug breaks, use a spark plug extraction tool or have a professional remove the broken piece. In severe cases, head removal might be necessary. Using nickel anti-seize on the threads of the new plugs can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the number of plugs broken and the repair method required.
    *   Recalls: None Found
