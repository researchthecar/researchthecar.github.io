The 2014 Ford Econoline Wagon, also known as the E-Series, is a full-size van known for its durability and practicality. This workhorse was available with multiple engine options, including a 4.6L V8 producing around 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L V8 generating approximately 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. The 2014 models all used a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the van's spaciousness, robust build, and towing capabilities. However, some common complaints include its outdated design, relatively poor fuel economy, and handling compared to more modern vans.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can break during removal, especially on higher mileage vehicles, due to carbon buildup and seizing in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Use specialized tools designed for removing stuck spark plugs. Applying penetrating oil several days before attempting removal can also help. In some cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed and professionally repaired.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the damage and if head removal is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Throttle Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, or hesitation during acceleration. The throttle body can become dirty and impede airflow.
    *   Solution: Clean the throttle body with throttle body cleaner. In some cases, the throttle position sensor (TPS) might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, spark plugs are prone to breaking during removal due to the two piece spark plug design.
    *   Solution: Use specialized extraction tools and techniques. Soak spark plugs in penetrating fluid beforehand. Be prepared to remove the cylinder head if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the extent of the damage and if head removal is required.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Throttle Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, or hesitation during acceleration. The throttle body can become dirty and impede airflow.
    *   Solution: Clean the throttle body with throttle body cleaner. In some cases, the throttle position sensor (TPS) might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R75E/4R70W)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jarring shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or when downshifting.
    *   Solution: Check and change the transmission fluid. If the issue persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In some cases, a faulty solenoid could be the culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revs high without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. Can occur in multiple gears.
    *   Solution: Begin with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If that doesn't solve the issue, internal components such as clutches or bands may be worn and require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Steering may feel loose or wandering. Excessive tire wear can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. A wheel alignment is recommended after the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sagging Rear Leaf Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sits noticeably lower than the front, especially when loaded. Reduced ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the van is frequently used for hauling or towing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for both sides.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks fail to operate, either intermittently or completely. Affects individual doors.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery warning light on the dashboard, dimming headlights, and eventual stalling of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator. Check the condition of the battery and charging system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming along the rocker panels, wheel wells, and lower edges of the doors. Especially prevalent in areas with road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust, repair the affected areas with body filler, and repaint. Prevention includes regular washing and application of rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per panel, depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaches from the backing and sags down.
    *   Solution: Re-glue the headliner fabric, or replace the entire headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Econoline Wagon is a reliable work van, but it is not without its issues. Engine problems such as broken spark plugs can be costly to repair, especially if the cylinder head needs removal. Transmission issues like harsh shifting and slipping can also be significant expenses. Suspension problems and electrical faults can add to the ownership costs. Rust is a prevalent issue, particularly in areas with salted roads. While the Econoline is known for its durability, buyers should be aware of these potential problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing, budgeting accordingly.
