The 2018 Ford Lobo, a Mexican market variant of the Ford F-150, offered a range of engine options, including the 2.7L EcoBoost V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (375 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque), 5.0L V8 Coyote (395 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), and the 3.0L Power Stroke diesel. The 2018 Lobo is generally appreciated for its robust capability, comfortable ride, and modern technology. However, some common complaints include issues with the 10-speed automatic transmission, specifically rough shifting and reliability concerns, as well as problems related to specific engine variants, such as oil consumption in the 5.0L V8 and potential turbocharger issues in the EcoBoost engines. Some also dislike the fuel economy on the gasoline engines.

**2.7L EcoBoost V6**
* **No Issues Found**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**
* **Cam Phaser Rattle**
    * Description/Symptoms: A distinct rattling noise upon cold start, often described as sounding like a chain being dragged. This is due to a faulty cam phaser not properly locking. Can lead to rough idling and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
