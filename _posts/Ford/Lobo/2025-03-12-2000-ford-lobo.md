Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2000 Ford Lobo (Mexican Market Ford F-150 equivalent). The 2000 Ford Lobo was offered with several engine options, including the 4.2L Essex V6 (202 hp and 252 lb-ft of torque), the 4.6L Triton V8 (220 hp and 290 lb-ft of torque), and the 5.4L Triton V8 (260 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the Lobo for its ruggedness, towing capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design. Common dislikes include fuel economy, ride quality (especially on older models), and certain age-related reliability issues.
