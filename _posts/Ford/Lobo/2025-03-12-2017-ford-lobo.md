The 2017 Ford Lobo, the Mexican market version of the F-150, is a popular truck known for its versatility and capability. Engine options include the 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (375 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque), the 5.0L V8 Coyote (385 hp, 387 lb-ft of torque), the 2.7L EcoBoost V6 (325 hp, 375 lb-ft of torque), and the 3.5L Naturally Aspirated V6 (282 hp, 253 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options are either a 6-speed automatic or a 10-speed automatic, depending on the engine and trim level. Owners often praise the Lobo for its comfortable ride, strong towing capacity, and modern technology. However, some common complaints revolve around potential engine issues, transmission problems (particularly with the 10-speed), and electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise upon cold start, rough idling, loss of power, and potential stalling. This occurs due to wear or failure of the cam phasers, which are crucial for variable valve timing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, loss of power, excessive smoke, and potentially a check engine light. This is usually due to wear or damage to the turbocharger's internal components.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8 Coyote**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil levels, needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust (indicating burning oil), and potential engine damage if left unaddressed. This issue is related to piston ring design in some early 5.0L Coyote engines.
    *   Solution: Involves replacing the piston rings with an updated design. In some cases, the entire engine needs to be rebuilt or replaced.

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, noticeable slipping between gears, clunking noises during gear changes, and hesitation when accelerating. This can be caused by valve body issues, worn clutches, or problems with the CDF drum.
    *   Solution: Replacement of valve body, CDF drum replacement, or full transmission rebuild/replacement

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Backup camera displaying a black screen, distorted image, or not functioning at all. This is often due to a faulty camera, wiring issues, or software glitches.

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford Lobo offers a capable and comfortable driving experience, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 3.5L EcoBoost (cam phaser and turbo failure) and the 5.0L Coyote (oil consumption), can be costly to repair. The 10-speed transmission can also present issues related to shifting. While electrical glitches and minor interior problems are also present, they are usually less severe. Overall, prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's service history, and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any potential problems before buying.
