    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking spark plugs, coil packs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the diagnosed issue; spark plugs typically $50-$150, coil packs $100-$300, fuel injectors $200-$600+.

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattle or knocking noise upon startup, especially when cold. This is due to a problem with the cam phasers, which control variable valve timing. The noise can worsen over time and potentially lead to engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+ depending on the shop and extent of damage.

**5.0L V8 Coyote**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably low oil level between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine knocking due to oil starvation. The issue is often attributed to piston ring design.
    *   Solution: Replacement of piston rings (expensive and labor-intensive) or, in severe cases, engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Piston ring replacement: $4,000 - $8,000+. Engine replacement: $6,000 - $10,000+.
