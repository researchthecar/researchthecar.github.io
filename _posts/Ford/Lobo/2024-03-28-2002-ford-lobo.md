**Introduction**

The 2002 Ford Lobo, the Mexican-market version of the F-150, was available with two engine options, a 4.6L V8 and a 5.4L V8, paired with either a 4-speed or 5-speed automatic transmission. Known for its spacious cabin, powerful engines, and excellent towing capabilities, the Lobo also has its share of common problems.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

- **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Causes coolant and oil leaks, rough idling, and overheating. Solution: Replace intake manifold gasket. Cost: $500 - $1,000+
- **Spark plug blow-out:** Occurs due to overtightening, leading to misfires and engine damage. Solution: Replace damaged spark plugs and spark plug threads. Cost: $200 - $500+
- **Camshaft position sensor failure:** Causes engine stalling, hard starting, and poor fuel economy. Solution: Replace camshaft position sensor. Cost: $100 - $300+

**5.4L V8**

- **Spark plug threads stripping:** Can occur during spark plug changes, leading to misfires and engine damage. Solution: Repair stripped threads using a thread repair kit or install a helicoil insert. Cost: $300 - $1,000+
- **Variable camshaft timing (VCT) solenoid failure:** Causes poor engine performance, reduced fuel economy, and warning lights. Solution: Replace VCT solenoid. Cost: $200 - $400+
- **Oil leaks from rear main seal:** Leads to oil loss and engine damage if left unaddressed. Solution: Replace rear main seal. Cost: $400 - $800+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R70W)**

- **Delayed or harsh shifting:** Result of worn transmission solenoids, causing delayed gear engagement or rough shifts. Solution: Replace transmission solenoids. Cost: $500 - $1,000+
- **Overheating:** Occurs due to insufficient cooling or a clogged transmission cooler. Solution: Flush transmission fluid and replace transmission cooler if necessary. Cost: $300 - $800+
- **Torque converter failure:** Can lead to shuddering, slippage, and transmission damage. Solution: Replace torque converter. Cost: $1,000 - $2,000+

**5-Speed Automatic (5R55E)**

- **Shifting problems:** May include harsh or delayed shifting, caused by a faulty solenoid pack or transmission fluid issues. Solution: Replace solenoid pack or service transmission. Cost: $400 - $1,200+
- **TCC shudder:** Experienced as a vibration during acceleration, caused by a worn torque converter clutch. Solution: Replace torque converter clutch. Cost: $600 - $1,500+
- **Valve body damage:** Can result in transmission fluid leaks, delayed or harsh shifting, and other transmission problems. Solution: Replace valve body. Cost: $800 - $1,800+
