Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2022 Ford Lobo, categorized by major components. It's important to note that "Lobo" is the name Ford uses for the F-150 in Mexico. Therefore, the information below primarily reflects issues reported with the 2022 Ford F-150 in the North American market, as those are the primary sources of reliability data.  The 2022 Ford F-150 offers several engine options including the 2.7L EcoBoost V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (400 hp, 500 lb-ft of torque), 5.0L V8 (400 hp, 410 lb-ft of torque), 3.5L PowerBoost Full Hybrid V6 (430 hp, 570 lb-ft of torque), and the high-output 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (450 hp, 510 lb-ft of torque).  All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The F-150 is generally praised for its ruggedness, capability, and technology, but some common dislikes include fuel economy (especially with the larger engines), potential reliability issues, and the rising cost of new trucks.

**Engine**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Running**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing engine misfires, rough idling, and a loss of power, especially under load or during acceleration. This can be due to condensation in the intercooler building up and restricting airflow in the engine. Some owners may also experience white smoke coming from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Some owners have had success with installing a weep hole in the intercooler to allow condensation to escape. Other solutions include replacing faulty spark plugs or ignition coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise from the engine, especially at startup. Can lead to rough running or stalling in some cases. This is similar to the issues found on the 2015-2020 models.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L PowerBoost Full Hybrid V6**

*   **Hybrid Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced hybrid system performance, error messages related to the hybrid battery, or complete failure of the hybrid system.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair or replacement of the hybrid battery or related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ depending on the specific component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormally high amount of oil between oil changes, requiring frequent top-offs. Can sometimes be seen as blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution:  Diagnosis to determine the root cause (e.g., faulty PCV valve, worn piston rings). Depending on the cause, the solution may involve replacing the PCV valve or more extensive engine repairs such as piston ring replacement.
