The 2016 Ford Lobo, essentially a Mexican market Ford F-150, is a popular truck known for its ruggedness and versatility. Available engine options included the 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (365 hp, 420 lb-ft of torque), the 5.0L V8 Coyote (385 hp, 387 lb-ft of torque), the 2.7L EcoBoost V6, and the 3.5L Naturally Aspirated V6. Transmission options were primarily the 6-speed automatic, with the 10-speed automatic appearing later in the F-150 run but not as frequently in the 2016 Lobo. Owners often praise the Lobo for its towing capacity, comfortable ride, and spacious cabin. Common dislikes include reported issues with the infotainment system, and occasional engine or transmission concerns depending on the chosen configuration.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbocharger, loss of power, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud rattling noise upon cold start, especially noticeable at idle. The noise usually subsides after a short period. This is due to issues with the Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers and potentially other VCT components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking/Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whistling noise from the engine bay, rough idle, poor fuel economy, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8 Coyote**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an excessive amount of oil, often requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not addressed. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Ford has issued Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) addressing this issue. The fix may involve replacing valve stem seals or, in more severe cases, piston rings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knocking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable knocking sound, especially under load, indicating potential issues with connecting rod bearings or other internal engine components.
    *   Solution: Requires engine disassembly and inspection. Repair may involve replacing bearings, rods, or even the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Coolant Intrusion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low coolant levels, white smoke from the exhaust, engine misfires, and potential engine damage.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (10R80)**

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford Lobo presents a range of potential issues, varying in severity and cost. Engine problems, particularly those related to the 3.5L EcoBoost (turbo, cam phasers) and 5.0L Coyote (oil consumption), can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 10-speed, can also be costly. Other common complaints involve electrical glitches (infotainment system) and suspension noises. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others may require significant investment. Before purchasing a 2016 Ford Lobo, a thorough inspection and review of its maintenance history are highly recommended.
