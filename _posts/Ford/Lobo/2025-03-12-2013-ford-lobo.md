**5.0L Ti-VCT V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include blue exhaust smoke (though not always present), and low oil level warnings.
    *   Solution: Potential fixes range from replacing the PCV valve to more extensive work such as piston ring replacement. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source.

    *   Solution: Use of a specialized extraction tool is required to remove broken spark plug pieces. Pre-soaking the spark plugs with penetrating oil before removal can help. Applying torque to the spark plug with a calibrated torque wrench is also important to ensure that the spark plug is not over-tightened on installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on how many plugs break and shop rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found
