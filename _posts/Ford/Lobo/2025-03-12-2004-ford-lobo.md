The 2004 Ford Lobo, a Mexican-market variant of the Ford F-150, was a popular truck known for its ruggedness and versatility. This model year offered several engine and transmission options. While precise horsepower and torque figures may vary slightly depending on tuning for the Mexican market, the engine options available were: a 4.2L Essex V6, a 4.6L Triton V8, and a 5.4L Triton V8. Transmissions included a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual, depending on the engine configuration. Owners generally appreciate the Lobo for its reliability, towing capacity, and spacious interior. However, common complaints revolve around fuel economy, certain electrical issues, and the age-related wear and tear on components, especially in older models.

**Summary:**

The 2004 Ford Lobo presents a mix of age-related issues. Engine issues such as spark plug blowouts and cam phaser problems (on the 5.4L V8) can be costly. Transmission problems, particularly with the automatic transmissions, can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like fluid changes to expensive rebuilds. Suspension and electrical issues are also common and can add to the overall cost of ownership. Rust, a common issue with older vehicles, is a significant concern in certain climates.
