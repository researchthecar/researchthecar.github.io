**Introduction:**

The 2004 Ford Lobo is a full-size pickup truck offered with three engine options: a 4.6L V8, a 5.4L V8, and a 6.8L V10. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic and a 5-speed automatic. Despite its popularity, the Lobo has faced numerous issues over the years.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**
- **Cam phaser failure:** Premature wear on the cam phasers can lead to reduced oil pressure, engine noise, and decreased performance. Requires cam phaser replacement. $1,200 - $1,800+
- **Intake manifold runner control (IMRC) system failure:** Faulty IMRC actuators can cause difficulty starting, rough idling, and reduced power. Replacement of IMRC actuators. $600 - $1,000+
- **Spark plug blowout:** Overtightening of spark plugs can lead to threads stripping and spark plug ejection. Repair involves replacing the cylinder head. $1,500 - $2,500+

**5.4L V8**
- **Spark plug blowout:** Similar to the 4.6L V8 issue.
- **Triton knock:** A persistent knocking sound in the engine caused by worn or loose connecting rod bearings. Requires rebuilding or replacement of the engine. $4,000 - $6,000+
- **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain can stretch or break over time, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Requires timing chain and related components replacement. $2,000+

**6.8L V10**
- **Spark plug blowout:** Similar to the 4.6L and 5.4L V8 issues.
- **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Leaking intake manifold gaskets can cause rough idling, decreased power, and reduced fuel economy. Replacement of intake manifold gaskets. $600-$1,200+
- **Piston ring wear:** Excessive wear on the piston rings can result in low compression, oil consumption, and engine damage. Requires rebuild or replacement of the engine. $5,000 - $8,000+

**Transmission**

**4-speed Automatic**
- **Failed torque converter:** A faulty torque converter can lead to shuddering, slipping, or complete transmission failure. Replacement of torque converter. $1,200 - $2,000+
- **Valve body failure:** Internal valve body components can fail, causing erratic shifting or transmission problems. Replacement or repair of valve body. $1,000 - $1,800+

**5-speed Automatic**
- **Solenoid pack failure:** Faulty solenoid packs can cause harsh shifting, delayed engagements, or transmission failure. Replacement of solenoid pack. $800 - $1,200+
- **Input shaft seal leak:** A leaking input shaft seal can allow fluid to escape, reducing transmission fluid levels and potentially causing damage. Replacement of input shaft seal. $600 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

- **Sway bar link failure:** Worn or damaged sway bar links can cause noise, handling issues, and decreased stability. Replacement of sway bar links. $200 - $400+
- **Ball joint failure:** Failed ball joints can lead to excessive play in the steering, premature tire wear, and potential accidents. Replacement of ball joints. $400 - $800+
- **Leaf spring failure:** Broken or cracked leaf springs can affect ride quality, handling, and towing capacity. Replacement of leaf springs. $600 - $1,200+

**Electrical**

- **Faulty battery modules:** Batteries can fail prematurely or exhibit reduced performance, especially in cold weather. Replacement of battery modules. $200 - $400+
- **Alternator failure:** A failing alternator can cause dim headlights, electrical system malfunctions, and battery discharge. Replacement of alternator. $400 - $800+
- **Starter failure:** A faulty starter can prevent the engine from cranking or starting. Replacement of starter. $600 - $1,000+
- **Blown fuses or relays:** Electrical shorts or overloads can cause fuses or relays to blow, resulting in loss of electrical functionality. Replacement of blown fuses or relays. $50 - $150+

**Exterior**

- **Rust:** The Lobo is prone to rust formation on the body panels, frame, and undercarriage. Prevention measures include regular washing, rustproofing, and touch-ups. Variable cost depending on severity.
- **Dent or scratch repair:** Dents and scratches can occur from daily use or external factors. Repair costs vary based on severity and size. Variable cost.

**Interior**

- **Climate control actuators:** Failed climate control actuators can cause problems with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Replacement of actuators. $400 - $800+
- **Power window failure:** Power window motors or switches can fail, affecting window operation. Replacement of window motors or switches. $200 - $600+
- **Instrument cluster failure:** The instrument cluster may experience malfunctions or display errors, affecting critical vehicle information. Repair or replacement of instrument cluster. $600 - $1,200+

**Summary:**

The 2004 Ford Lobo has a variety of issues affecting major components, including significant engine and transmission problems. The repairs can be costly, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
