Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2019 Ford Lobo (which is essentially the Ford F-150 in Mexico), separated by category and engine/transmission configuration. The 2019 Ford F-150/Lobo offered a range of engine options including the 2.7L EcoBoost V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), the 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (375 hp, 470 lb-ft of torque; High Output version with 450 hp, 510 lb-ft of torque available on Raptor), the 5.0L V8 (395 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), and the 3.0L Power Stroke diesel V6 (250 hp, 440 lb-ft of torque). The base engine was a 3.3L V6 with a 6-speed transmission, but all other engines were paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the F-150/Lobo for its capability, versatility, and available technology. Common dislikes include certain engine reliability issues (especially related to the 5.0L V8 oil consumption and the 3.5L EcoBoost timing chain issues), and the cost of repairs.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Timing Chain Stretch/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine rattle on startup, especially when cold. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to camshaft timing. Potential for reduced performance or engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, guides, and potentially camshaft phasers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, whistling noises from the engine bay.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Sometimes the oil supply lines to the turbochargers can become clogged, causing premature failure, so these should also be inspected/replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+ (depending on single vs. dual turbo replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warnings, the need to add oil frequently between oil changes. Blue smoke from the exhaust may be present.
    *   Solution: This issue is often related to the cylinder deactivation system (if equipped) or piston ring design. TSB 21-2264 outlines several possible solutions, ranging from software updates to piston ring replacement. Some owners have had success with oil catch cans.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (for software update) to $5,000+ (for piston ring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Rough Idle/Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Engine shaking, stalling, or hesitation. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related to misfires.
    *   Solution: Often related to faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Replacing the affected components usually resolves the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the number of components needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Power Stroke Diesel V6**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Rough running engine, black smoke from exhaust, difficulty starting, fuel in oil, engine knock.
    *   Solution:  Replacement of faulty injectors.  Requires specialized tools and knowledge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500-$4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, slipping between gears, a noticeable "clunk" noise during shifting, particularly at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: This is often related to the valve body, CDF drum (the CDF drum is more prevalent in earlier models), or torque converter. Some owners have had success with transmission fluid changes or software updates. Others require valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (for fluid change) to $5,000+ (for full rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of drive, inability to shift, loud noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement or complete rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable sagging in the rear of the truck, especially when loaded or towing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes frequently.
    *   Solution: Software updates are often the first step. In some cases, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software update) to $500 - $1,500+ (for APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms:  Battery dies overnight or after a short period of inactivity.  Jump starting required frequently.
    * Solution:  Diagnose parasitic draw.  Often caused by faulty modules (e.g., door lock actuators, infotainment system), or improperly installed aftermarket accessories.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue and the parts needing replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Issues**

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford Lobo/F-150, while a popular and capable truck, is susceptible to several common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 3.5L EcoBoost and 5.0L V8, and transmission issues with the 10-speed automatic are major concerns. Electrical problems and suspension issues are also present. The severity and cost of these repairs can range from minor inconveniences costing a few hundred dollars to major repairs costing several thousand. Potential buyers should carefully inspect vehicles, obtain service records, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
