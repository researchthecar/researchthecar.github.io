The 2001 Ford Lobo, a Mexican market variant of the Ford F-150, was a popular truck known for its ruggedness and utility. Engine options included the 4.2L Essex V6, the 4.6L Triton V8, and the 5.4L Triton V8. The 4.2L V6 produced around 202 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. Available transmissions were primarily a 4-speed automatic (4R70W/4R75E) and a 5-speed manual. Owners generally appreciated the Lobo's capability, spacious cabin, and familiar Ford truck dependability. Common dislikes often included fuel economy, especially with the larger V8 engines, and the aging design compared to newer trucks. Due to the vehicle being a variation of the F-150, many common issues that are experienced with the Ford F-150 will also be experienced with the Ford Lobo.

**Engine**

**4.2L Essex V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, coolant leaks, and potential overheating.
