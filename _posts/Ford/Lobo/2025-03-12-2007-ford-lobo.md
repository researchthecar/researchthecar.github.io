Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2007 Ford Lobo (Mexican market F-150 equivalent), organized by category and powertrain configuration. The 2007 Ford Lobo, just like the F-150 in the US, was a popular truck known for its versatility and robust build. It offered a range of engine options, including the 4.2L V6, 4.6L V8, and the 5.4L V8. The 5.4L V8 was a standout, producing around 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque, offering plenty of power for towing and hauling. Owners often praised the Lobo/F-150 for its comfortable ride, spacious cabin, and towing capability. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, some engine issues (particularly with the 5.4L), and occasional electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**4.2L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can become seized in the cylinder heads, and the threads can strip when attempting removal. This can lead to misfires and rough running.
    *   Solution: Carefully remove the spark plugs, and if the threads are damaged, use a thread repair kit (such as a Time-Sert) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ (depending on the severity and chosen repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L 3V V8 Triton**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, the 5.4L engine is notorious for spark plugs breaking or stripping the threads in the aluminum cylinder heads during removal, especially if they have been in place for a long time.
    *   Solution: Use penetrating oil before attempting removal. If a plug breaks, use a specialized extraction tool. Repair damaged threads with a thread repair kit or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ (depending on the severity and chosen repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking, rattling noise from the engine, especially at idle or low RPM. Can lead to rough running and reduced power. Related to the variable valve timing (VVT) system.
