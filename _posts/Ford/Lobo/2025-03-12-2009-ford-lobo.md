The 2009 Ford Lobo is essentially the Mexican market version of the Ford F-150. It was offered with several engine options including a 4.2L V6 (202 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.6L 2V V8 (248 hp and 294 lb-ft of torque), a 4.6L 3V V8 (292 hp and 320 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.4L 3V V8 (310 hp and 365 lb-ft of torque). The available transmissions were mostly the 4-speed 4R70W transmission with some of the V8 models being equipped with the 6-speed 6R80 transmission. Owners typically appreciated the Lobo for its ruggedness, towing capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design. Common dislikes included fuel economy, and some of the interior materials. Here are some common issues reported by owners:

**Engine**

**4.2L V6**
*   **No Issues Found**

**4.6L 2V V8**
*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can become seized in the cylinder head, leading to damage to the threads when attempting removal. This often results in a blown spark plug or engine misfire.
    *   Solution: Carefully remove the spark plugs, preferably when the engine is warm but not hot. Use anti-seize compound on the new spark plug threads. If the threads are already damaged, a thread repair kit (Helicoil) can be used or the cylinder head may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on severity and repair method).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.6L 3V V8**
*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L 2V, spark plugs can seize and damage the cylinder head threads upon removal. Leading to blown spark plugs or engine misfire.
    *   Solution: Carefully remove the spark plugs, preferably when the engine is warm but not hot. Use anti-seize compound on the new spark plug threads. If the threads are already damaged, a thread repair kit (Helicoil) can be used or the cylinder head may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on severity and repair method).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise from the engine, especially at idle. Can also cause rough running or reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L 3V V8**
*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L V8 engines, spark plugs can seize and damage the cylinder head threads upon removal. Leading to blown spark plugs or engine misfire. This issue is prevalent on the 5.4L 3V engine.
    *   Solution: Carefully remove the spark plugs, preferably when the engine is warm but not hot. Use anti-seize compound on the new spark plug threads. If the threads are already damaged, a thread repair kit (Helicoil) can be used or the cylinder head may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on severity and repair method).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Roller Follower/Lifter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, especially noticeable at idle or low RPMs. Can cause rough running or misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected roller follower(s)/lifter(s) and potentially the camshaft.

    *   Solution: In many cases, a software update or recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford Lobo, while generally a reliable truck, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most concerning and potentially costly problems revolve around the spark plug thread damage, cam phaser failure, and roller follower failures with the 4.6L and 5.4L 3V engines. Transmission issues with the 6R80 can also be expensive to address. Other issues, like suspension wear and electrical problems, are more typical for a vehicle of this age but still need to be inspected. Overall, a thorough pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended, paying close attention to the engine for unusual noises and checking for signs of rust.
