The 2021 Ford Lobo, essentially the Mexican market version of the Ford F-150, offers a blend of rugged capability and modern features that appeals to a wide range of drivers. Engine options include the 2.7L EcoBoost V6 (325 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), the 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (400 hp, 500 lb-ft of torque), the 5.0L V8 Coyote (400 hp, 410 lb-ft of torque), and the 3.0L Power Stroke Diesel V6 (250 hp, 440 lb-ft of torque). A fully hybrid model is also available in some trims. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Lobo for its comfortable ride, powerful engine options, and advanced technology features. Some common criticisms include the sometimes-complex infotainment system and occasional quality control issues.

**Engine**

**2.7L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than normal oil consumption between oil changes. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and potential repairs such as PCV valve replacement, or piston ring replacement, depending on the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise upon startup, rough idling, and potential loss of power. This is a common issue with earlier EcoBoost engines and can still occur in the 2021 model, though less frequently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers and potentially the timing chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wastegate Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of boost pressure, reduced engine power, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the wastegate actuator or the turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L V8 Coyote**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.7L EcoBoost, some 5.0L Coyote engines exhibit excessive oil consumption, particularly after higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level monitoring, potential PCV valve replacement, or in severe cases, piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ticking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or knocking sound coming from the engine, often more prominent at idle or low speeds. Can be related to the roller followers or even piston slap.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the source of the noise. Repairs may range from replacing roller followers to more extensive engine work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Power Stroke Diesel V6**

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and potentially black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ depending on the number of injectors needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, especially between lower gears. A noticeable "clunk" sound can occur during shifts.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) may help. In some cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement is needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $6,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPM increases without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. The transmission may feel like it's "slipping" out of gear.
    *   Solution: Similar to harsh shifting, software updates can sometimes alleviate the issue. If the problem persists, transmission inspection and potential repairs (valve body, solenoids, etc.) or replacement are necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $6,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 4 infotainment system can occasionally freeze, lag, or become unresponsive. This may require a system reboot to resolve.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Ford. In severe cases, replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (APIM replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains unexpectedly, especially after sitting for a few days. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from an electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the source of the parasitic drain. Repairs may involve replacing a faulty module or component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Running Boards Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power running boards may fail to extend or retract properly, or may get stuck in one position.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the hinges and joints. Replacement of the motor or the entire running board assembly may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,500+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Tailgate Step Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult to open or close the step assembly, sticking, or unusual sounds when operating.
    *   Solution: Cleaning, lubrication, or repair of the hinge mechanisms. If severely damaged, replacement of the step assembly or tailgate may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters fail to warm up, or only heat up intermittently.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of the failure. Repairs may involve replacing the heating element or the seat heater control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof motor failure, leaks, or difficulty opening/closing.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the sunroof motor, sealing, or entire assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford Lobo, while generally a reliable and well-regarded truck, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems such as cam phaser failure (3.5L EcoBoost) and excessive oil consumption (2.7L EcoBoost and 5.0L Coyote) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the 10-speed automatic, especially harsh shifting and slipping, are also frequently reported. Electrical glitches related to the infotainment system and battery drain can be frustrating. Exterior and interior issues such as power running board malfunctions, tailgate step problems, and seat heater failures are less critical but can still require attention. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, with engine and transmission repairs potentially costing several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing or potential problems.
