**Summary**

The 2011 Ford Lobo/F-150, while a capable and popular truck, has some common issues. Engine problems like oil consumption in the 5.0L and turbo failures in the 3.5L EcoBoost can be costly.

Aluminum body panel corrosion (on equipped models) can be a significant cosmetic and potentially structural concern.

The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the severity.
