**Introduction**

The 1998 Ford Lobo is a full-size pickup truck that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. It was praised for its powerful engines and sturdy construction, but it also had some notable issues. Here is a comprehensive list of the specific problems people are having with the vehicles:

**Engine**

* **4.6L V8**
    * **Valve seat insert failure:** The valve seat inserts can fail, causing the valves to recess into the cylinder heads. This can lead to a loss of compression, engine knocking, and eventually engine failure.
    * **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak. This can lead to rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a decrease in power.
    * **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain can fail, causing the engine to stall. This is a major repair that can cost upwards of $2,000.
* **5.4L V8**
    * **Spark plug blowout:** The spark plugs can blow out of the cylinder heads, causing a loss of compression and engine damage. This is a common problem on early 5.4L V8 engines.
    * **Cam phaser failure:** The cam phasers can fail, causing the engine to run rough and lose power. This is a major repair that can cost upwards of $3,000.
    * **Intake manifold runner control (IMRC) failure:** The IMRC system can fail, causing a loss of power and fuel economy. This is a relatively common problem on 5.4L V8 engines.
* **6.8L V10**
    * **Head gasket failure:** The head gaskets can fail, causing coolant to leak into the cylinders. This can lead to overheating, engine damage, and eventually engine failure.
    * **Spark plug blowout:** The spark plugs can blow out of the cylinder heads, causing a loss of compression and engine damage. This is a common problem on early 6.8L V10 engines.
    * **Valve seat insert failure:** The valve seat inserts can fail, causing the valves to recess into the cylinder heads. This can lead to a loss of compression, engine knocking, and eventually engine failure.

**Transmission**

* **4-speed automatic (4R70W)**
    * **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter can shudder when the transmission is shifted into gear. This is a common problem on 4R70W transmissions.
    * **Transmission slipping:** The transmission can slip, causing a loss of power and acceleration. This is a major repair that can cost upwards of $2,000.
* **5-speed automatic (4R100)**
    * **Overheating:** The transmission can overheat, causing a loss of power and transmission damage. This is a common problem on 4R100 transmissions.
    * **Transmission slipping:** The transmission can slip, causing a loss of power and acceleration. This is a major repair that can cost upwards of $2,000.
* **6-speed manual (MT-82)**
    * **Grinding gears:** The transmission can grind gears when shifting. This is a common problem on MT-82 transmissions.
    * **Difficult shifting:** The transmission can be difficult to shift, especially when the vehicle is cold. This is a common problem on MT-82 transmissions.
* **Recall:** NHTSA Campaign Number 02V290000: Transmission may overheat and fail

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension:**
    * **Ball joint failure:** The ball joints can fail, causing the front wheels to wobble and the vehicle to pull to one side. This is a major safety hazard that should be repaired immediately.
    * **Control arm bushing failure:** The control arm bushings can fail, causing the front end of the vehicle to shake and vibrate. This is a relatively common problem on Lobos.
* **Rear suspension:**
    * **Leaf spring failure:** The leaf springs can fail, causing the rear of the vehicle to sag and the tires to wear unevenly. This is a major repair that can cost upwards of $1,000.

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery can drain quickly, even when the vehicle is turned off. This is a common problem on Lobos.
* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing the battery to drain and the vehicle to stall. This is a major repair that can cost upwards of $500.
* **Ignition switch failure:** The ignition switch can fail, preventing the vehicle from starting. This is a major safety hazard that should be repaired immediately.
* **Recall:** NHTSA Campaign Number 18V877000: Battery overcharge melted cable and caused fire

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate latch failure:** The tailgate latch can fail, causing the tailgate to open unexpectedly. This is a major safety hazard that should be repaired immediately.
* **Recall:** NHTSA Campaign Number 01V247000: Tailgate door handle could be dangerous to children
* **Side mirrors:** The side mirrors can vibrate excessively at highway speeds. This can be a distraction for the driver.
* **Recall:** NHTSA Campaign Number 15V227000: Side view mirrors deflect

**Interior**

* **Dashboard cracks:** The dashboard can crack, especially on vehicles that are exposed to a lot of sunlight. This is a cosmetic issue that does not affect the functionality of the vehicle.
* **Door panel rattles:** The door panels can rattle when the vehicle is driven on rough roads. This is a common problem on Lobos.
* **Climate control issues:** The climate control system can malfunction, causing the vehicle to blow hot or cold air when it is not supposed to. This is a common problem on Lobos.

**Summary**

The 1998 Ford Lobo is a reliable truck overall, but it is not without its problems. The engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems can all have issues. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major safety hazards. The cost to repair these issues can also be significant, so it is important to factor this into the cost of ownership.
