    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbochargers experiencing premature failure. Symptoms include loss of power, excessive smoke (blue or white), and unusual noises from the engine compartment.
    *   Solution: Replacing the failed turbocharger(s). It is also necessary to check the oil supply lines to the turbocharger(s) for blockages or restrictions, and repair them if needed.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wastegate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wastegate controls the boost pressure by bypassing exhaust gases from the turbocharger turbine, preventing overboost. Issues can cause rattling noises, reduced performance, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the wastegate actuator or the entire turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
