**Engine**

**4.6L 2V V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage During Removal**

    *   Solution: Use penetrating oil, work the spark plug back and forth gently, and use a spark plug extraction tool if breakage occurs. In severe cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed and machined.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the severity and method of extraction.
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.6L 3V V8**
