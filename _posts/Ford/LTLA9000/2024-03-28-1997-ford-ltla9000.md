    * **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing vacuum leaks and a loss of power. Symptoms include a rough idle, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+
* **6.8-liter V10 Gasoline Engine**
    * **Ignition coil failure:** The ignition coils can fail, causing misfires and a loss of power. Symptoms include a rough idle, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the ignition coils. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200 per coil+
    * **Fuel injector failure:** The fuel injectors can fail, causing the engine to run lean or rich. Symptoms include a rough idle, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the fuel injectors. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $400 per injector+

**Transmission**

* **Five-speed manual transmission**
    * **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out, causing the transmission to slip or fail to engage. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, a chattering noise, and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the clutch. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Leaf spring failure:** The leaf springs can break or sag, causing the truck to ride rough and lose stability. Symptoms include a rough ride, poor handling, and a sagging rear end. The solution is to replace the leaf springs. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000 per leaf spring+

**Electrical**

* **Battery failure:** The battery can fail, causing the truck to lose power. Symptoms include a dead battery, dim headlights, and a check engine light. The solution is to replace the battery. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $200+

**Summary**

The 1997 Ford LTLA9000 is a durable and reliable pickup truck, but it is not without its problems. Some of the most common issues include head gasket failure, intake manifold gasket failure, ignition coil failure, fuel injector failure, clutch failure, leaf spring failure, battery failure, alternator failure, rust, dashboard cracks, and HVAC system failure. The severity of these issues varies from minor to major, and the cost to fix them can range from $100 to over $2,000.
