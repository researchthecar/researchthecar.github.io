The 2004 Ford Ikon, also known as the Ford Fiesta in some markets, was a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. Engine options included a 1.3L Rocam engine producing around 70 horsepower and approximately 77 lb-ft of torque. A common complaint with vehicles of this age is general parts wearing out and needing replacement. The Ikon was generally praised for its maneuverability and practicality in urban environments, but criticized for its somewhat basic interior and limited features.

**Engine**

**1.3L Rocam**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the 1.3L Rocam engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-ups. This can be indicated by blue smoke from the exhaust, especially during startup.
    *   Solution: A compression test and leak-down test should be performed to determine the source of oil consumption. Depending on the results, the solution could range from replacing valve stem seals to a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (valve stem seals) - $1500+ (engine rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idling Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic idling, stalling, or difficulty starting can occur with the 1.3L Rocam. This may be due to a dirty throttle body or a faulty idle air control (IAC) valve.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body, inspecting and cleaning the IAC valve, and resetting the ECU may resolve the issue. If the IAC valve is faulty, it should be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cleaning) - $150+ (IAC valve replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Manual Transmission (Specific Type Not Specified)**

*   **Difficulty Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted difficulty shifting, particularly into first or reverse gear. This can manifest as a grinding noise during gear changes or the gear lever feeling stiff.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and replacing the clutch cable and clutch disc, pressure plate and throw-out bearing. Transmission fluid should be checked and changed if needed. If the issue persists, internal transmission damage might be present, requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (cable replacement) - $800+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Given the age of the vehicle, worn suspension components such as shocks, struts, and bushings are common. Symptoms include excessive bouncing, poor handling, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    *   Solution: Inspect all suspension components and replace any that are worn or damaged. This may include shocks, struts, sway bar links, and control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Dimming Headlights/Interior Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights or interior lights, especially at idle, may indicate a problem with the alternator or battery.
    *   Solution: Have the battery tested to ensure it is holding a charge. Have the alternator tested to make sure it is providing the proper voltage to charge the battery. Replace the battery or alternator if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on whether the battery or alternator needs replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially in areas prone to moisture and road salt exposure, such as wheel wells, rocker panels, and undercarriage.
    *   Solution: Treating the affected areas with rust converters, fillers, and repainting can prevent further corrosion. In severe cases, body panel replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (minor spot treatment) - $1000+ (major body work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of the dashboard due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat is a common complaint in older vehicles.
    *   Solution: Dash covers can conceal the damage. In some cases, the dashboard can be repaired or replaced, but this is a more costly solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $30 (dash cover) - $500+ (dashboard replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Ford Ikon, while appreciated for its fuel efficiency and practicality, is prone to issues typical of vehicles of its age. Engine issues, particularly oil consumption and idling problems with the 1.3L Rocam engine, and transmission difficulties may arise. Suspension wear and tear, electrical problems like dimming lights, rust formation, and interior degradation such as dashboard cracking are also common. The severity and cost of repairs vary greatly depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage, but owners should be prepared for potential expenses ranging from minor fixes to more substantial repairs.
