Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues reported for the 2006 Ford Ikon, categorized by major component, with specific engine and transmission options addressed.

The 2006 Ford Ikon, primarily sold in markets like India and South Africa, was known for its compact size, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Engine options typically included a 1.3L Rocam petrol engine (around 70 hp and 78 lb-ft of torque) and a 1.4L diesel engine. A popular choice for city driving, it was appreciated for its maneuverability, but criticized for its relatively basic features and sometimes questionable build quality.

**Engine**

**1.3L Rocam Petrol Engine**

*   **Idling Issues and Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, engine stalling, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Clean the idle air control (IAC) valve. Check for vacuum leaks. Inspect and possibly replace the mass airflow (MAF) sensor.

*   **Knocking Sound While Driving**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking noise that becomes more prevalent during acceleration or when the engine is under load.
    *   Solution: Could be a few different things depending on the severity of the issue. Low octane fuel can cause pre-detonation (knocking) and should be changed to the proper fuel. It may be necessary to adjust the timing or look for potential bearing damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $25-$500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.4L Diesel Engine**
