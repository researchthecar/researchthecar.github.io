The 2005 Ford Ikon, also known as the Ford Fiesta in some markets, was a subcompact car popular for its fuel efficiency and affordability. In many markets, the 2005 Ikon was available with a 1.3L Rocam petrol engine producing around 68 horsepower and approximately 77 lb-ft of torque, or a 1.6L Rocam petrol engine producing around 96 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L Duratorq diesel engine. These engines were typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Ikon's compact size for city driving, its reasonable fuel economy, and its price point. Common complaints often revolved around the relatively basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and the somewhat underpowered engines, especially when fully loaded.
