Both engines were available with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 1.3-liter engine produced 69 horsepower and 82 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.6-liter engine produced 91 horsepower and 109 lb-ft of torque.

The Ikon was praised for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and spacious interior. However, it was also criticized for its lack of power, especially when equipped with the 1.3-liter engine.
