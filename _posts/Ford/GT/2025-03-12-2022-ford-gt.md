The 2022 Ford GT is a limited-production, mid-engine supercar that pays homage to the iconic GT40 race cars of the 1960s. It features a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine producing 660 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. There are no other engine or transmission options available. People generally love the GT for its stunning design, incredible performance, and exclusivity. Some dislike the limited visibility, stiff ride, and high price tag. Due to its limited production numbers, finding documented widespread issues is challenging. However, some common themes have emerged.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature turbocharger failure, leading to a loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling), and potentially black smoke from the exhaust. This may stem from oil starvation or excessive heat.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected turbocharger(s). Diagnosis should include checking oil lines and intercooler piping for obstructions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (depending on if one or both turbos need to be replaced, labor, and shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light can be indicative of fuel injector problems. Direct injection engines, like the one in the GT, are susceptible to carbon buildup on the injectors, leading to poor fuel atomization.
    *   Solution: Fuel injector cleaning or replacement. Carbon cleaning of the intake valves may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on the number of injectors, cleaning vs. replacement, and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Clutch Slippage/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported clutch slippage, especially during aggressive acceleration, and harsh or jerky shifting, particularly at lower speeds. This could indicate premature clutch wear or issues with the transmission's control software.
    *   Solution: Transmission recalibration or clutch replacement. Thorough diagnosis of the transmission control module (TCM) is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $15,000+ (depending on if it is a software issue or if the clutch needs to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Damper Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Ford GT features an advanced active suspension system. Some owners have experienced failures with the dampers (shocks), leading to a loss of ride quality and handling performance. Symptoms can include a bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected damper(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+ (per damper including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Occasional freezing, lagging, or unresponsiveness of the infotainment system have been reported. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software update or replacement of the infotainment unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the severity and whether replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Delamination of Carbon Fiber Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some instances of delamination of the carbon fiber body panels have been reported, particularly in areas exposed to high heat or stress. This can manifest as bubbling or separation of the carbon fiber layers.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the affected body panel(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $20,000+ (depending on the size and location of the damage, repair versus replacement, and paint matching)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford GT, while an exceptional performance vehicle, can be subject to some common issues. Engine issues, particularly turbocharger failures and fuel injector problems, can be costly to address. Transmission problems like clutch slippage and harsh shifting, along with suspension issues like damper failures, can also arise. Some owners report electrical issues with the infotainment system and exterior delamination of the carbon fiber body panels. The severity of these problems varies, but due to the GT's high-performance nature and sophisticated components, repairs can be expensive.
