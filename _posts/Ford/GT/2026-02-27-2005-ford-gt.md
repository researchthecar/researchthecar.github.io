### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford GT, while a remarkable machine, presents a reliability profile consistent with a low-volume, high-performance supercar. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the powertrain, specifically the supercharger belt and potential coolant leaks from the robust V8 engine. The manual transmission, while generally robust, can experience clutch wear and, less commonly, synchronizer issues, which are significant but expected for a performance-oriented gearbox. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM, can occur but are not pervasive. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally well-regarded for their durability. Owners should be prepared for higher maintenance costs and the potential for specialized repairs, especially concerning the engine and transmission.
