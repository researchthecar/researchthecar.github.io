The 2005 Ford GT is a mid-engine, two-seater sports car that pays homage to the Ford GT40 racing cars of the 1960s. It was produced for the 2005 and 2006 model years. All 2005 Ford GTs came equipped with a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 engine producing 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Ricardo 6-speed manual transmission. Owners generally praise the car's performance, iconic design, and collectibility. Common criticisms include the limited production numbers, high purchase price, and occasional maintenance challenges due to the car's specialized components.
