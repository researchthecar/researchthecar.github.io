# 2017 Ford GT

### Overview
The 2017 Ford GT is a halo supercar, representing the pinnacle of Ford's performance engineering. As such, its design prioritizes extreme performance and exotic materials over mass-market practicality and long-term, low-cost ownership. Reliability data for such low-volume, high-performance vehicles is often scarce in public databases compared to mainstream models. However, the GT's focus on robust, race-derived components suggests a high degree of engineering integrity. Owners typically engage with specialized service centers, and maintenance is a significant part of the ownership experience. The data below reflects known or anticipated areas of attention for a vehicle of this caliber, rather than common consumer complaints.

### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Ford GT, being an ultra-low-volume supercar, is engineered for extreme performance. While its core powertrain components (3.5L EcoBoost V6 and 7-speed dual-clutch transmission) are robust and have not reported widespread issues, the exotic nature of the vehicle means specialized components are more susceptible to issues. The pushrod suspension actuators, active aerodynamics, and delicate carbon fiber bodywork and interior trim are areas where owners might encounter repair needs. These are typically high-cost repairs due to the specialized nature of the parts and labor required. Reliability is generally considered high for its intended purpose, but maintenance and repair costs are significantly higher than for mainstream vehicles.
