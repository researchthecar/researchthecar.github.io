The 2017 Ford GT is a mid-engine, two-seater sports car that pays homage to the iconic GT40 race cars of the 1960s. It boasts a powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine producing 647 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque, paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The car is celebrated for its stunning design, advanced aerodynamics, and exceptional performance on both the road and track. However, the exclusivity and low production numbers meant that even minor issues were highly publicized. Common criticisms included the controversial EcoBoost engine choice for a supercar, the limited availability, and the high price tag coupled with Ford's stringent ownership restrictions. The following outlines some common issues encountered by 2017 Ford GT owners.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Excessive Valve Train Noise/Ticking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a noticeable ticking or knocking noise coming from the engine, particularly at idle or low speeds. This is sometimes attributed to the high-performance nature of the engine, or the direct injection system. Some claim it can be an issue with the valves.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified technician is required. Depending on the cause, solutions may include valve adjustment, replacement of valve train components, or fuel system cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnosis is typically $100 - $200+. Repair costs can range from $500 to $5,000+, depending on the severity and the necessary repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some EcoBoost engines of this era experienced issues with the cylinder head design allowing coolant to leak into the combustion chamber, leading to white smoke from the exhaust, rough running, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head(s) is often required. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have described experiencing rough or jerky shifts, particularly at low speeds. Hesitation during acceleration or delayed gear engagement has also been reported.
    *   Solution: This can sometimes be addressed with a software update to the transmission control module (TCM). In other cases, valve body issues or clutch wear may require more extensive repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update: $100 - $300. Valve body replacement/repair: $1,500 - $4,000+. Clutch replacement: $4,000 - $8,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Hydraulic Suspension Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the hydraulic suspension system, including leaks, uneven ride height, or failure to adjust properly. This can lead to poor handling and ride quality.
    * Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the hydraulic system, which may include replacing lines, pumps, accumulators, or control modules.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+, depending on the component that needs replacing.

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford GT, while a technological marvel and a performance icon, has experienced some issues that owners should be aware of. The most concerning appear to be related to the engine, specifically potential coolant intrusion, and the transmission, with reported shifting issues. While the severity and frequency of these problems vary, they can be costly to repair. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified technician familiar with high-performance vehicles and EcoBoost engines. Due to the limited production, repairs are usually expensive.
