The 2006 Ford GT is a mid-engine, two-seater sports car that pays homage to the legendary GT40 race cars of the 1960s. It features a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 engine producing 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Ricardo 6-speed manual transmission. Known for its stunning design, exhilarating performance, and rarity, the Ford GT is highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. However, like any performance car, it has its share of potential issues. Owners often praise its head-turning looks, incredible acceleration, and track-focused handling, but some common complaints include a stiff ride, limited visibility, and the high cost of maintenance and repairs.
