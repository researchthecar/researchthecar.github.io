The 2019 Ford GT is a mid-engine, two-seater sports car that pays homage to the legendary Ford GT40 race cars of the 1960s. It features a 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 engine producing 660 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque. It is paired exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Owners praise the GT for its stunning design, incredible performance, and exclusivity. However, some dislike its limited production numbers, high price tag, and relatively impractical nature for daily use.
