Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Ford E-Transit, formatted for your website and focusing on accuracy and consistency.

The 2022 Ford E-Transit is Ford's first all-electric cargo van, aimed at commercial customers. It's powered by a single electric motor driving the rear wheels, producing 266 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. One of the biggest selling points of the E-Transit is its potential for reduced operating costs due to lower fuel and maintenance expenses. Many users appreciate its quiet operation and smooth acceleration. Some common dislikes include the limited range compared to gasoline-powered vans, and the charging infrastructure requirements for commercial fleets.

**Electric Motor**

**Single Electric Motor (266 hp / 317 lb-ft)**

*   **Motor Control Module (MCU) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may experience a sudden loss of power, error messages related to the powertrain, or the vehicle may not start. Diagnostic codes may point to the MCU or related components.
    *   Solution: The MCU typically needs to be replaced. The dealer will diagnose and confirm the failure. Some cases might involve software updates to the MCU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Voltage Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced range compared to the original specifications, longer charging times, or error messages related to battery health. This is not always a defect, but can be accelerated in certain conditions like extreme temperatures or frequent DC fast charging.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a Ford dealer to determine the extent of the degradation. In some cases, individual battery modules can be replaced under warranty. In severe cases, the entire battery pack may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: (Battery module replacement) $1,000 - $3,000+. (Full battery pack replacement) $15,000 - $25,000+ (Typically covered under warranty if within the battery warranty period).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical System**

*   **Charging Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle may fail to charge, charge slowly, or display error messages during charging. This can be related to the onboard charger, the charging port, or the charging cable.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a Ford dealer to determine the source of the issue. May involve replacing the onboard charger, the charging port, or the charging cable. Ensuring proper grounding of the charging station is also critical.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Software Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the infotainment system, driver-assist features, or other electronic systems. This can manifest as screen freezes, system resets, or error messages.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Ford are typically the solution. In some cases, a hard reset of the system may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Typically covered under warranty or a service campaign if it's a known issue. Otherwise, diagnostic and labor costs may apply ($100 - $300+).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **12V Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to ICE vehicles, the 12V battery can cause issues such as difficulty starting (powering on) the vehicle, dimming lights, or error messages. The 12V system powers the computers and accessories.
    *   Solution: Testing the 12V battery and replacing if necessary. Ensuring the charging system for the 12V battery is functioning correctly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (Battery replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The side sliding door (if equipped) not opening or closing properly. Can be due to misaligned sensors, damaged wiring, or problems with the door motor.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific cause and replace or adjust the faulty parts. This can include sensor replacement, wiring repair, or motor replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the component affected.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment screen freezing, crashing, or becoming unresponsive. This can affect navigation, media playback, and vehicle settings.
    *   Solution: Check for available software updates. A hard reset of the system may be necessary. If the problem persists, component replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (component replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

No Issues Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford E-Transit appears to have a mix of electrical and drivetrain-related issues. The most serious and potentially costly problems revolve around the motor control module and high voltage battery. While battery issues are often covered under warranty, MCU failures and electrical glitches can be disruptive.

The severity of these issues can range from inconvenient software glitches to significant powertrain failures. The cost of repairs can vary greatly, from a few hundred dollars for a sensor replacement to thousands for motor control module or battery work.
