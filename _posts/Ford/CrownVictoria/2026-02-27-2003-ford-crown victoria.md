### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford Crown Victoria generally exhibits good reliability, especially concerning its powertrain, due to its robust V8 engine and durable transmission. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and spark plug ejection on the 4.6L V8, and torque converter shudder or slipping gears in the 4R70W transmission. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and occasional alternator failures are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints can wear, and if equipped with air suspension, the compressor is a point of failure. Exterior and interior components are typically solid, reflecting the vehicle's utilitarian design. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to maintaining its reliability.
