Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2007 Ford Crown Victoria, adhering to your specified format.

The 2007 Ford Crown Victoria is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan known for its durability and spaciousness. It's particularly popular as a former police car, taxi, and fleet vehicle. The only engine option available was the 4.6L Modular V8, which produced around 224 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque in standard form, and 239 hp/287 lb-ft in some configurations. All models came equipped with a 4R70W or 4R75W 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Crown Victoria's comfortable ride, large trunk, and simple, robust design. Common complaints include its relatively poor fuel economy and dated interior.

**Engine**

**4.6L Modular V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak near the front of the engine, often accompanied by a sweet coolant smell. Can lead to engine overheating if coolant level drops significantly.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold. Updated intake manifolds are available which address the cracking issue with improved materials.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Spark Plug Thread Stripping in Cylinder Heads**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plug ejection from the cylinder head, often accompanied by a loud popping noise and misfire. This is more common on early 2-valve 4.6L engines, but can still occur on the 2007 model year.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head. Repair options include using thread repair inserts (e.g., Time-Sert).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on repair method and whether the head needs to be removed)
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling, especially when coming to a stop.
    * Solution: Clean or replace the IAC valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W/4R75W 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. Can manifest as a "clunk" when shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Sometimes, a complete transmission rebuild is recommended if the transmission has significant mileage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the repair/rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, or a complete loss of power transfer.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's generally recommended to replace the transmission fluid and filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Hard Shifts**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission shifts hard and harshly between gears.
    * Solution: Start with checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If it's low or dirty, perform a fluid and filter change. If the issue persists, further diagnosis is needed, possibly involving the valve body or solenoids.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, air compressor running constantly or not at all. "Suspension" light on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the air suspension compressor. Consider replacing the air springs as well, as they may be leaking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on whether just the compressor or the whole system is addressed)
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per side)
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noise from the front or rear suspension, especially when turning or going over bumps.
    * Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the temperature of the air coming from the vents. Air may only blow hot or cold, regardless of the setting. Clicking noise behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator. This can be a labor-intensive job as it often requires removing part of the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Lighting Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent headlight or taillight failures, often caused by corroded bulb sockets or wiring issues.

    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. Prevention is key: regular washing and application of rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Clock Spring Failure**

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford Crown Victoria, while generally reliable, has some common issues owners should be aware of. Engine issues like intake manifold leaks and spark plug thread stripping can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, particularly with the valve body, are also not uncommon. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension system (if equipped) and worn ball joints, can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical gremlins such as blend door actuator failure can impact comfort. Rust is a potential concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Overall, most issues can be addressed with proper maintenance and timely repairs, but some repairs can be costly. Buyers should carefully inspect potential purchases for signs of these common problems.
