The 2010 Ford Crown Victoria is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan known for its durability, reliability, and spacious interior, which made it a popular choice for taxi fleets and police departments. It was only offered with one engine option: the 4.6L Modular V8 producing around 224 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque (depending on the trim; police interceptors had slightly more power). This engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission (4R70W/4R75E). People liked the Crown Victoria for its comfortable ride, robust construction, and ease of maintenance. Common dislikes included its outdated design, relatively poor fuel economy compared to modern vehicles, and handling that wasn't particularly sporty.
