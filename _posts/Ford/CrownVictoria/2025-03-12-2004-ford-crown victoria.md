The 2004 Ford Crown Victoria is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan known for its durability, spacious interior, and traditional body-on-frame construction. Primarily used as fleet vehicles, including taxis and police cars, these cars are appreciated for their reliability and ease of maintenance. The sole engine option for the 2004 Crown Victoria is the 4.6L Modular V8, producing around 220 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque in standard form, with higher outputs available in the Police Interceptor version. This engine was paired with a 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission. Some common criticisms include the car's relatively low fuel economy for its power output and somewhat dated handling characteristics compared to more modern sedans. People often like the Crown Victoria for it's smooth ride, reliability, and simple design.

**Engine**

**4.6L Modular V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold is prone to developing cracks, particularly near the coolant crossover. This can lead to coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a sweet coolant smell, visible coolant leaks under the vehicle, and the engine running hot.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold with an updated version, preferably one with an aluminum coolant crossover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cylinder heads have relatively few threads for the spark plugs. Over time, especially with improper torque during spark plug changes, the threads can strip or become damaged. This results in spark plug blow-out, misfires, and potential damage to the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repair the spark plug threads using thread repair kits (e.g., Heli-Coil). In severe cases, cylinder head replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the repair method
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The IAC valve can become clogged or fail, leading to rough idling, stalling, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The shift solenoids inside the transmission can fail, causing erratic shifting, failure to shift, or harsh shifts.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s). Requires dropping the transmission pan.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, causing shuddering during acceleration, poor fuel economy, and eventual transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and potentially rebuild the transmission if there is internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ball joints, especially the lower ones, are prone to wear and can fail, causing clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. Often requires replacing the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some Crown Victorias (usually higher trim levels) came with an optional air suspension system. Common issues include leaking air springs, a failing air compressor, and faulty height sensors. This results in a sagging rear end, a rough ride, and the air compressor running constantly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air springs with new air springs or convert to coil springs. Replace the air compressor or height sensors as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the parts replaced or conversion route.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuator controls the flow of hot and cold air into the cabin. Failure results in either only hot or only cold air blowing from the vents, regardless of the temperature setting. A clicking noise may also be heard from behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the blend door actuator. This can be a labor-intensive job.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lighting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headlights and taillights are prone to bulb burnout and socket corrosion. The parking lights and brake lights are also a common source of problems.
    *   Solution: Replace bulbs and clean or replace corroded sockets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Crown Victorias are susceptible to rust, especially in areas where salt is used on roads. Common rust spots include the rocker panels, lower doors, wheel wells, and frame rails.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace rusted panels. Apply rust inhibitors to prevent further corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power window motors can fail, causing the windows to stop working.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door lock actuators can fail, causing the door locks to stop working.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2004 Ford Crown Victoria, while known for its reliability and longevity, does have some common issues. The most concerning are the potential for intake manifold cracks and spark plug thread damage on the 4.6L engine, which can lead to significant repair costs. Suspension issues, particularly with the ball joints and air suspension (if equipped), are also common. Electrical problems like blend door actuator and power window failures can be annoying and costly to repair. While some rust is expected on a vehicle of this age, extensive rust can lead to significant bodywork costs. Overall, many of the issues are relatively minor and can be addressed with regular maintenance, but potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of larger engine and suspension repairs.
