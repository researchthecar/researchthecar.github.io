The 2009 Ford Crown Victoria, a full-size sedan known for its robust build and reliability, was a popular choice for fleet vehicles and private owners alike. It was offered with a single engine option: the 4.6L Modular V8, producing approximately 224 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque. The engine was paired with a 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission.
