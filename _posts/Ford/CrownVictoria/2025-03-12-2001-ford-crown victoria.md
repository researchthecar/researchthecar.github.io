The 2001 Ford Crown Victoria is a full-size, rear-wheel-drive sedan known for its robust build, spacious interior, and traditional body-on-frame construction. It was a popular choice for taxi fleets and police departments due to its reliability and durability. The 2001 model year Crown Victoria was primarily equipped with a 4.6L SOHC V8 engine, producing around 200 horsepower and 265 lb-ft of torque in standard form, and up to 235 horsepower in the LX Sport trim. It was available exclusively with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the car's smooth ride and comfortable cabin, but some dislike its fuel economy and somewhat dated styling.

**Engine**

**4.6L SOHC V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original composite intake manifold is prone to cracking, especially around the coolant crossover. This leads to coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage. Symptoms include a sweet smell of coolant, low coolant levels, and visible leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked intake manifold with an updated version, preferably one with an aluminum coolant crossover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The aluminum cylinder heads are prone to spark plug thread stripping or failure. This can cause misfires, rough running, and spark plugs to eject from the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repair the damaged threads using a thread repair kit (Heli-Coil or similar) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Ford Crown Victoria, while generally reliable, does suffer from some common issues. The most pressing are the potential for intake manifold cracking and spark plug thread failure in the engine, which can lead to significant repair costs if not addressed promptly. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension system (if equipped), and electrical problems with blend door actuators and window regulators are also common. Overall, while the Crown Victoria can be a dependable vehicle, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the cost of repairs and maintenance. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to more serious mechanical problems, and repair costs can vary widely depending on the specific issue and the repair method chosen.
