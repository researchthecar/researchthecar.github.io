The solution is to replace the rear suspension components, such as the springs, shocks, and control arms. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $1,000.

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery may drain prematurely, causing the vehicle to not start. Symptoms include a dead battery, a decrease in battery life, and a loss of electrical power. The solution is to diagnose and repair the cause of the battery drain, such as a faulty alternator, parasitic draw, or a faulty battery. The estimated cost to fix is $100 - $500.
* **Alternator failure:** The alternator may fail, causing the battery to not charge. Symptoms include a dead battery, a decrease in battery life, and a loss of electrical power. The solution is to replace the alternator. The estimated cost to fix is $500 - $1,000.
