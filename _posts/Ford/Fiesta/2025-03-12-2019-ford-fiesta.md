The 2019 Ford Fiesta is a subcompact car known for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Two engines were available for the 2019 model year: a 1.6L Ti-VCT I-4 producing 120 hp and 112 lb-ft of torque and a 1.6L EcoBoost I-4 producing 197 hp and 202 lb-ft of torque. The 1.6L Ti-VCT engine was paired with a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6L EcoBoost was paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners often praise the Fiesta's fun-to-drive nature and compact size, making it ideal for city driving. However, some common complaints include limited rear passenger space, a basic interior, and a sometimes-rough ride quality.
