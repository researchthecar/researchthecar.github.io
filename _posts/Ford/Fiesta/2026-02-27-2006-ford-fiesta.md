### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford Fiesta is generally a dependable small car, with its petrol engines being particularly robust. The diesel variants, while offering better fuel economy, can be prone to issues with injectors and turbochargers, which can be costly to repair. Manual transmissions are typically reliable, though clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Automatic transmissions may experience issues with fluid leaks or solenoids. Suspension components like bushings and wheel bearings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and window regulators are also noted. Exterior rust, especially on wheel arches and sills, is a concern in certain climates. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and minor rattles are the most frequently reported problems. Overall, the Fiesta offers good value, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific issues associated with the diesel engines and common wear items.
