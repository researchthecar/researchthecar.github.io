The 2015 Ford Fiesta is a subcompact car known for its nimble handling, fuel efficiency, and affordability. Engine options include a 1.0L EcoBoost I3 producing 123 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L Ti-VCT I4 producing 120 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. A high-performance ST variant features a turbocharged 1.6L EcoBoost I4 making 197 horsepower and 202 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a 6-speed manual specific to the ST. Owners appreciate the Fiesta's compact size for city driving and its relatively engaging driving dynamics. Common criticisms include the sometimes-unrefined automatic transmission and limited rear passenger space.
