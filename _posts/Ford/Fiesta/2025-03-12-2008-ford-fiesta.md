The 2008 Ford Fiesta, a subcompact car popular in Europe and other global markets (but not the US), offered practicality and fuel efficiency. The European model offered a range of engines, including the popular 1.25L Duratec petrol engine (approximately 75 horsepower and 80 lb-ft of torque) and the 1.4L Duratorq TDCi diesel engine. Other petrol engines included a 1.4L Duratec and a 1.6L Duratec. Transmission options typically included a 5-speed manual and, in some markets, a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Fiesta's nimble handling, fuel economy, and compact size, making it ideal for city driving. Common complaints included the relatively basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and, depending on the engine, a lack of power for highway driving. Reliability issues were also a concern for some owners, as outlined below.

**Engine**

**1.25L Duratec Petrol**

*   **Rough Idle/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine idles roughly, stalls, especially when cold, and may exhibit hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the idle air control valve (IACV), check for vacuum leaks, and ensure the throttle body is clean. If that does not resolve the issue, check the coil packs and spark plugs, and replace them if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the water pump, thermostat housing, or radiator hoses.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component (water pump, thermostat housing, or hoses) and replenish the coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $400+

**1.4L Duratec Petrol**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the valve cover gasket or the rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $500+

**1.6L Duratec Petrol**

*   **Hesitation on Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation during acceleration. Can be more prominent when cold.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor or the throttle position sensor (TPS) if testing determines either is faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

**1.4L Duratorq TDCi Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, excessive smoke, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty injector(s). Requires specialized tools and diagnostic equipment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogs, leading to reduced engine performance, warning lights, and potential limp mode.
    *   Solution: Attempt DPF regeneration (either forced regeneration or driving at sustained speeds), or replace the DPF if regeneration fails.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Difficulty Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting gears, especially into 1st or 2nd gear, or grinding noises during shifts.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable, inspect the clutch master and slave cylinders for leaks, and replace the clutch kit if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $700+

*   **Worn Synchros**
    * Description/Symptoms: Grinding noises during gear changes, particularly when shifting quickly.
    * Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement, including replacement of worn synchros.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+

**4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Slipping Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips between gears, leading to delayed acceleration and erratic shifting.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush, inspect the valve body for wear or damage, and rebuild or replace the transmission if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and harsh gear changes.
    * Solution: Inspect and possibly replace the transmission control module (TCM).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps, and imprecise handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn suspension bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **Failed Shock Absorbers/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor ride quality, and reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed shock absorbers or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Instrument Cluster**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent gauge readings, flickering lights, or complete instrument cluster failure.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **Central Locking Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Central locking system malfunctions, preventing doors from locking or unlocking remotely.
    *   Solution: Check the door lock actuators, wiring, and central locking module. Repair or replace faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent dead battery.
    * Solution: Conduct a parasitic draw test to identify the circuit causing the excessive drain.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Wheel Arches and Sills**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the wheel arches and sills, particularly in areas with high road salt usage.
