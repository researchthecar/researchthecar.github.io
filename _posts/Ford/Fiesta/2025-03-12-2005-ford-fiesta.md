The 2005 Ford Fiesta was a popular subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. Engine options for the European market (since that is what I have access to) include various petrol and diesel engines. The 1.25L Duratec petrol engine produces around 75 horsepower and around 81 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the Fiesta's compact size, making it easy to maneuver and park in urban environments. However, some common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly concerning electrical components and premature wear of suspension parts.
This response focuses on common issues reported for the 2005 Ford Fiesta sold in the European market, as this is what I can find accurate information on.

**Engine**

**1.25L Duratec Petrol Engine**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
