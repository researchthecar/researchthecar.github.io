### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ford Fiesta is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly with its manual transmission and the 1.6L engine. The main areas of concern tend to be related to the cooling system and potential oil leaks on the 1.6L engine, and more significant issues with the PowerShift automatic transmission, which can experience shuddering and overheating. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may require attention as the vehicle ages. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure and power window problems, are also reported. While not a perfect record, most issues are repairable and not indicative of systemic failure across the board, especially when compared to its competitors in the subcompact segment.
