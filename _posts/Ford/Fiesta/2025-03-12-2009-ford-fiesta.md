The 2009 Ford Fiesta marked a significant return for the nameplate to the North American market after a long hiatus. This subcompact car was praised for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and stylish design, particularly the European-inspired hatchback variant. The primary engine option for the North American 2009 Fiesta was a 1.6L Duratec inline-4 engine producing approximately 120 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked its affordability, modern interior for its class, and fun-to-drive nature. Common dislikes included its somewhat cramped rear seats, limited cargo space, and the 4-speed automatic transmission being considered outdated compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**1.6L Duratec Inline-4**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can occur due to faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or vacuum leaks. Symptoms include a rough idle, decreased fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils or spark plugs. Inspect vacuum lines for leaks and repair as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the number of coils or spark plugs needing replacement, and if you do the work yourself)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A failing PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve can cause oil leaks, rough idle, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $80 (depending on labor costs)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting or slipping between gears, especially as the vehicle ages.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can alleviate the problem. However, if the issue persists, a transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250 (fluid and filter change), $1500 - $3000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises when going over bumps, poor handling, and uneven tire wear can indicate worn suspension components such as struts, shocks, and bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts, shocks, and bushings. An alignment should be performed after suspension work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the specific components needing replacement and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain can be caused by parasitic draw from electrical components or a failing alternator.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Repair or replace faulty components. Test and replace the alternator if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the complexity of the electrical issue)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent failures or flickering of the instrument cluster. Gauges may stop working or display inaccurate readings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the instrument cluster, or repair of the wiring connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the repair or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust can appear on various body panels, especially in regions with harsh winter conditions or heavy salt usage on roads.
    *   Solution: Sanding and repainting affected areas. Rust repair can become costly if the rust is extensive and has penetrated the metal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the severity and location of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may fail to blow cold air. This can be caused by a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a failing blower motor.
    *   Solution: Recharge the refrigerant, replace the compressor, or replace the blower motor as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+ (depending on the component that requires repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford Fiesta, while praised for its fuel efficiency and handling, does have some common issues to watch out for. Engine misfires and PCV valve issues are relatively common and can be addressed with moderate expense. The 4-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting problems, which may lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues like battery drain and instrument cluster malfunctions can also occur. Exterior rust is something to be aware of, especially in certain climates. Overall, while the Fiesta can be a reliable and economical choice, being aware of these potential issues and performing regular maintenance is key to long-term ownership. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major repairs, with costs ranging from a few dollars for a PCV valve to several thousand for a transmission rebuild.
