### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford Fiesta is a generally reliable small car, particularly with its petrol engines. The manual transmissions are more prone to wear-and-tear issues like clutch problems and gear selector cable faults, while the automatic can suffer from fluid leaks. Suspension components, especially front springs and rear axle bushings, are common wear items that can develop issues with age. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster failures and window regulators, are also noted. Rust can be a concern on lower body panels. Overall, for its age and segment, it represents a reasonable choice if well-maintained, with potential buyers advised to inspect for common issues.
