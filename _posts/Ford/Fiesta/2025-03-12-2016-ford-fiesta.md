**Summary**

The 2016 Ford Fiesta, while appreciated for its fuel economy and handling, has some noteworthy issues, primarily related to the 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (Powershift). The transmission issues can range from annoying (harsh shifting) to severe (complete failure) and potentially costly. Other issues like coolant leaks and electrical problems are less common but still worth considering. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's transmission performance, check for any active recalls, and consider getting a pre-purchase inspection. The severity of the issues is moderate to high depending on the failure and can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars to repair.
