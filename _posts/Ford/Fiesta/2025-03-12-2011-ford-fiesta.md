The 2011 Ford Fiesta is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and relatively stylish design, especially for its class. It was available with a 1.6L Duratec I-4 engine producing approximately 120 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. The Fiesta offered two transmission choices: a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed PowerShift automatic (DCT). Owners generally liked the Fiesta's fuel economy, small size for urban driving, and modern interior. Common dislikes included the PowerShift transmission's reliability, perceived lack of power, and occasionally cramped rear seats.
