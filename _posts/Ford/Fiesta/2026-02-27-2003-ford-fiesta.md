### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford Fiesta is a generally dependable small car, particularly with its petrol engines. The main areas of concern tend to be the automated manual transmission (Durashift EST) which can suffer from actuator and pump issues, and potential rust on older models, especially in adverse climates. Diesel variants, while offering better economy, can experience issues with injectors and turbochargers. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module, can also arise. Suspension components like bushings and shocks are typical wear items that may require attention. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential weak points, the 2003 Fiesta can remain a cost-effective and reliable vehicle.
