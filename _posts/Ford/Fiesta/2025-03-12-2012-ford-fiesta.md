The 2012 Ford Fiesta is a subcompact car that was praised for its fuel efficiency, agile handling, and stylish design, especially for its price point. It was offered in both hatchback and sedan body styles. However, it is also known for some reliability issues, particularly with its automatic transmission. The 2012 Fiesta came with a 1.6L Ti-VCT I-4 engine, producing around 120 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. The engine could be paired with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed PowerShift automatic transmission. A major area of concern among owners centers around the PowerShift transmission and its reliability. Many owners also enjoyed the interior design for being modern for its time, and others enjoyed the fuel economy provided by the vehicle. However, many people disliked the reliability of the PowerShift transmission.
