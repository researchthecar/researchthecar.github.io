**2009 Ford Fiesta**

The 2009 Ford Fiesta is a subcompact car available with three engine options: a 1.6-liter inline-four, a 1.6-liter Ti-VCT inline-four, and a 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-four, paired with either a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, or 6-speed Powershift dual-clutch transmission. Praised for its sporty handling, fuel efficiency, and comfortable interior, the Fiesta has also received criticism for its stiff ride, limited rear seat space, and cheap-looking interior materials.
