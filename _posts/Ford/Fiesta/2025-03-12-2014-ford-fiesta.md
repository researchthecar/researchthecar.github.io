**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Fiesta has several notable issues, primarily related to the PowerShift transmission and electrical components. The PowerShift transmission problems are the most severe and costly to address, potentially requiring clutch replacement or TCM replacement. Engine issues such as coolant leaks and turbocharger failure with the 1.0L EcoBoost, and Purge Valve or IMRC valve failure with the 1.6L can also be expensive to repair. Other issues such as door latch malfunctions and battery drain can be less costly but still inconvenient. Before buying a 2014 Ford Fiesta, especially one equipped with the PowerShift transmission, a thorough inspection is highly recommended.
