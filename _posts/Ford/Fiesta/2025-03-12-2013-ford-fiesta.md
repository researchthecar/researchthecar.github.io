The 2013 Ford Fiesta is a subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and nimble handling. It was available with a 1.0L EcoBoost I3 engine (late availability) that produced 123 horsepower and 148 lb-ft of torque or a 1.6L Ti-VCT I4 engine producing 120 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual transmission and a 6-speed PowerShift automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Fiesta's affordability, fuel economy, and maneuverability in urban environments. Common complaints revolve around the reliability of the PowerShift transmission, cramped rear seating, and some interior material quality.

**Engine**

**1.6L Ti-VCT I4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and potential stalling, especially during cold starts. This can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Diagnosis via OBD-II scanner is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A faulty purge valve can cause rough idling, stalling, difficulty starting the engine, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the purge valve solenoid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed PowerShift Automatic (DPS6)**

*   **Clutch Slippage and Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation upon acceleration, shuddering during gear changes, and a general lack of smooth power delivery. This is a very common issue with the DPS6 transmission due to the dry dual-clutch design. Can also lead to eventual transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Ford has issued multiple Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) and extended warranties related to this issue. The fix often involves replacing the clutch packs and/or reprogramming the Transmission Control Module (TCM). In some cases, full transmission replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls:
        *   17V-052: Concerns the Transmission Clutch and/or TCM.
        *   18V-735: Concerns a possible cracked transmission case
        *   19V-719: Concerns the possible separation of a transmission component.

*   **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, difficulty shifting into gear, loss of power, and illumination of the check engine light. TCM failures are prevalent in these transmissions, often due to heat and vibration.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TCM and potentially reprogramming by a Ford dealer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: 20V-035: Concerns vehicles that have previously received a TCM as part of recall 17V-052

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery failure or difficulty starting the vehicle. This can be due to a parasitic draw from a faulty module or aftermarket accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and addressing the source of the parasitic draw, which may involve replacing a faulty module or disconnecting aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Latch Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors failing to latch properly, difficulty opening or closing doors, and the door ajar light staying on.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door latch assembly.

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin from the sunroof, often staining the headliner.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and unclogging the sunroof drain tubes, or replacing damaged seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Ford Fiesta is a fuel-efficient and affordable subcompact car but it is also plagued by some notable reliability concerns. The most serious and prevalent issue is the problematic 6-speed PowerShift automatic transmission, with clutch slippage, shuddering, and TCM failures. These transmission issues can lead to expensive repairs, ranging from clutch replacements to full transmission overhauls. Other common issues include engine misfires, electrical problems like battery drain, and door latch failures. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, the transmission problems can be a significant financial burden. When purchasing a 2013 Fiesta with the automatic transmission, a thorough inspection of the transmission's condition is essential, and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended.
