The 2010 Ford Fiesta marked a significant redesign for the North American market, offering a subcompact car that prioritized fuel efficiency and nimble handling. It was available with a 1.6L Duratec I4 engine producing 120 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. While praised for its styling, fuel economy, and affordability, the 2010 Fiesta has been known to have a few common issues, primarily related to its transmissions. Owners appreciate the Fiesta's compact size, ease of parking, and relatively low running costs. Conversely, complaints often revolve around the car's sometimes unreliable automatic transmission and occasionally cramped interior space.

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford Fiesta, while economical and fun to drive, has some notable problem areas. The biggest concern is undoubtedly the 6-speed automatic transmission, which can suffer from clutch failure and TCM issues leading to high repair costs. Other problems, such as engine misfires and electrical issues, are less severe but should still be considered. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect any used Fiesta carefully, especially if it's equipped with the automatic transmission.
