### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Ford Fiesta offers a generally dependable ownership experience, particularly with its manual transmission variants and the naturally aspirated 1.6L engine. The primary areas requiring owner attention are the automatic PowerShift transmission, which has been subject to reports of shuddering and occasional failures, and certain electrical components like the infotainment system. The 1.0L EcoBoost, while efficient, has a higher potential for internal coolant leaks and turbocharger issues. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any transmission or engine warning lights are recommended for optimal long-term reliability.
