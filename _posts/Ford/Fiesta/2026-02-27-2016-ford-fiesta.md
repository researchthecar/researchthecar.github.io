### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford Fiesta is a generally dependable vehicle, particularly with the manual transmission. The most significant concerns revolve around the 6-speed automatic PowerShift transmission, which has been known to exhibit shuddering and premature failure, leading to costly repairs. The 1.0L EcoBoost engine, while efficient, can experience more serious issues like coolant leaks from the block and turbocharger problems. The 1.6L engine is more straightforward but can suffer from typical coolant and oil leaks. Suspension components and some electrical issues like door locks and infotainment glitches are also reported, but are generally less severe and more common wear items. Owners should be particularly vigilant about the automatic transmission's behavior and consider the manual if reliability is a top priority.
