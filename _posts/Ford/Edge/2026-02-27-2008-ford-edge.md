### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Ford Edge, powered by its 3.5L V6 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission, presents a generally solid reliability record for its class. However, common issues tend to revolve around the engine's Variable Cam Timing (VCT) system and intake manifold runner control, as well as potential leaks or torque converter problems in the transmission. Suspension components like struts and control arm bushings can wear over time, leading to ride quality issues. Electrical gremlins, such as power window motors and instrument cluster faults, are also noted. Exterior and interior issues are less frequent but can include tailgate latch problems and HVAC blower resistor failures. Addressing these potential concerns proactively can help maintain the 2008 Ford Edge's overall functionality and longevity.
