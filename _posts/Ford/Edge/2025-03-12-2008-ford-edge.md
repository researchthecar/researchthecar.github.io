The 2008 Ford Edge is a mid-size crossover SUV that offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and decent performance. Two engine options were available: a 3.5L Duratec V6 producing 265 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine producing 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally like the Edge's styling, comfortable seats, and smooth ride. Common complaints include issues with the electronic throttle body, interior trim quality, and some electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.5L Duratec V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump is located internally, driven by the timing chain. Failure can lead to coolant leaking into the engine oil, overheating, and potential engine damage. Signs include coolant loss, milky oil, engine overheating, and a whining noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump, timing chain, and potentially other components depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Solenoid Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The VVT solenoids control oil flow to the camshaft phasers. Malfunctioning solenoids can cause rough idling, reduced engine performance, and the check engine light to illuminate with codes related to VVT.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty VVT solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, is a common symptom. Other signs include harsh shifting, slipping, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary if the damage is extensive.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift at all. Can also cause transmission to get stuck in a specific gear.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500

**Summary**

The 2008 Ford Edge has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly water pump failure on the 3.5L V6, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues like torque converter failure are also relatively common. Electrical glitches and sunroof issues are also fairly common issues. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite significant, so a thorough inspection before purchase is highly recommended.
