The 2023 Ford Edge is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. It comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 250 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. An available upgrade is the 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 engine in the Edge ST, delivering 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Edge's smooth handling, quiet cabin, and ample cargo space. Common dislikes often include the somewhat bland styling and the lack of a hybrid powertrain option.

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include the low oil pressure light illuminating, the need to add oil every few thousand miles, and potential engine knocking in severe cases.
    *   Solution: A potential fix can be to replace the PCV valve. A compression test can be performed to identify damaged parts such as piston rings. Replacing these will allow the engine to have proper sealing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (Engine rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Coolant Intrusion**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported coolant intrusion into the cylinders, causing white smoke from the exhaust, rough running, and eventual engine failure. This is often related to cylinder head cracking.
    * Solution: A pressure test can be performed to check for a leak. If coolant intrusion is identified, the cylinder head needs to be replaced. In more severe cases, a full engine replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ (Cylinder head replacement or engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration and deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and software update may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Fluid flush) - $3,000+ (Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **SYNC Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 4 infotainment system may occasionally freeze, become unresponsive, or crash, requiring a system reboot. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a soft reset of the SYNC system. If the issue persists, a software update from the dealer might be required. In more severe cases, the APIM module could need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) - $800+ (APIM Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera. The screen may display a black image or a distorted view.
    *   Solution: Inspect the camera wiring for damage. If the wiring is okay, replace the camera.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks around the sunroof, particularly during heavy rain. This can lead to water stains on the headliner and potential damage to electrical components.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the sunroof drain tubes. Repairing or replacing the sunroof seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noises emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or rear cargo area, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locating the source of the rattle and tightening loose components or adding insulation/padding. The rear shock bushings could be a potential culprit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Ford Edge generally presents with a mix of minor and potentially more serious issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the 2.7L EcoBoost engine's coolant intrusion and the excessive oil consumption of the 2.0L EcoBoost. While the transmission harsh shifting is a common complaint, it's not always indicative of major mechanical failure. Electrical glitches with the SYNC system and backup camera are also notable. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively inexpensive fixes to costly engine or transmission repairs, making it essential for prospective buyers to be aware of these potential problems.
