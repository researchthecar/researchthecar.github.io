### Summary Verdict
The 2023 Ford Edge demonstrates a commendable level of reliability, with most systems performing as expected. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the powertrain, specifically minor coolant leaks and turbocharger issues with the 2.0L EcoBoost, and oil leaks or carbon buildup with the 2.7L EcoBoost. The automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit hesitation. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and intermittent battery drain, are also noted but generally manageable with software updates or targeted diagnostics. Exterior and interior components have largely proven durable. Overall, the Edge is a reliable choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific, though not necessarily widespread, issues and factor in potential repair costs for the engine and electrical systems.
