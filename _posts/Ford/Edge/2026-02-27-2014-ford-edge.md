### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ford Edge presents a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its standard V6 engine options. The most frequently cited concerns revolve around the turbocharged 2.0L EcoBoost engine, specifically its turbocharger and cooling system, and potential issues with the 6-speed automatic transmission's shifting performance and leaks. Suspension components like struts and bushings can wear over time, as expected for a vehicle of this age and type. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system, are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, owners should be aware of these potential areas and budget accordingly for repairs, especially if purchasing a used model.
