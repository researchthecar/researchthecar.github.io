The 2021 Ford Edge is a mid-size SUV that offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and user-friendly technology. The available engine options include the standard 2.0L EcoBoost I4, producing 250 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and the 2.7L EcoBoost V6, which generates 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque (found in the Edge ST). Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Edge for its quiet cabin, ample cargo space, and responsive handling. However, some common complaints include the sometimes-sluggish performance of the base engine and the infotainment system's complexity.

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford Edge, while generally a reliable vehicle, can be prone to certain issues. Engine issues are less common, but the 2.0L EcoBoost engine is known to have some problems with excessive oil consumption, which can be costly to address. Transmission issues with the 8-speed automatic, like harsh shifting, are also a concern. Electrical glitches, especially those related to the infotainment system and backup camera, can be frustrating but are often resolved with software updates or component replacement.
