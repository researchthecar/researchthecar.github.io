The 2019 Ford Edge is a mid-size SUV offering a blend of comfort, technology, and performance. Available engine options include the standard 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4, producing 250 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, and the optional 2.7L EcoBoost V6, which cranks out 335 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque in the Edge ST trim. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Edge for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. However, some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the infotainment system, occasional transmission issues, and concerns regarding the reliability of certain electronic components.

**Engine**

**Summary:**

The 2019 Ford Edge has several potential issues that buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L EcoBoost and turbocharger issues in the 2.7L EcoBoost, can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting and torque converter problems, are also prevalent. Electrical issues with the SYNC 3 system and battery drain are common annoyances. Suspension bushing wear and liftgate malfunctions can also occur. While some issues are minor and relatively inexpensive to fix, others can lead to significant repair bills. Pre-purchase inspections and thorough test drives are recommended to identify any potential problems before purchasing a used 2019 Ford Edge.
