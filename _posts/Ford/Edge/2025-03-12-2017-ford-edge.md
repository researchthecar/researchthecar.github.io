Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2017 Ford Edge, organized by category and engine/transmission options.

The 2017 Ford Edge is a popular mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available technology features. Engine options include a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 producing 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 delivering 280 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 generating 315 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engine options were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Edge for its sleek design and smooth driving experience, but some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, potential powertrain problems, and electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion/Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking into the cylinders, excessive coolant consumption without external leaks. This can lead to engine overheating, misfires, and potential engine damage. This is often due to cylinder head cracking.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cylinder head assembly. In severe cases, the entire engine may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and necessary repairs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, unusual noises (whining or whistling) from the turbocharger, check engine light. This can be due to oil starvation or bearing failure within the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Ti-VCT V6**

*   **Oil Leaks (Valve Cover Gaskets/Timing Cover)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks visible around the valve covers or timing cover area, burning oil smell, low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve cover gaskets and/or timing cover gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the location of the leak and labor involved).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Coolant Intrusion/Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking into the cylinders, excessive coolant consumption without external leaks. This can lead to engine overheating, misfires, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the engine assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and necessary repairs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, delayed engagement, transmission slipping, and unusual noises coming from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Transmission flush and fluid change may temporarily alleviate the issue. In many cases, the valve body or the entire transmission needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (flush) to $3,000 - $5,000+ (replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation, particularly at lower speeds or when the transmission is under load (e.g., going uphill). Often occurs when the torque converter clutch is engaging or disengaging.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush with a specific friction modifier additive may help. In severe cases, torque converter replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (flush with additive) to $1,000 - $2,500+ (torque converter replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear, poor handling, and excessive bouncing. Common culprits include worn-out struts, shocks, ball joints, and control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ per component (depending on the specific part and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sync 3 Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, Crashing, Slow Response Times, Bluetooth Connectivity Problems, Navigation Errors, Blank Screen.
    *   Solution: Software updates can sometimes resolve these issues. In other cases, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (Software Update) to $500 - $1,200+ (APIM Replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days, preventing the vehicle from starting.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the parasitic draw. This may involve identifying and replacing faulty modules, wiring harnesses, or accessories that are drawing power when the vehicle is off.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Issues**

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford Edge has a mix of potential issues ranging from minor infotainment glitches to more significant engine and transmission problems. Engine issues, particularly coolant intrusion in the 2.0L and 2.7L EcoBoost engines, can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting and torque converter shudder, are also relatively common. Electrical issues, especially with the Sync 3 system, can be frustrating for owners. While some problems are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can lead to substantial repair bills.
