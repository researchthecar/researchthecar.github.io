The 2012 Ford Edge is a mid-size crossover SUV that offers a blend of comfort, practicality, and style. It was available with three engine options: a 2.0L EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder (240 horsepower, 270 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L Duratec V6 (285 horsepower, 253 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.7L Duratec V6 (305 horsepower, 280 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Edge's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and modern features.
