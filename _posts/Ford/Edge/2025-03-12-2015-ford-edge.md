The 2015 Ford Edge is a mid-size crossover SUV that offers a comfortable ride and a spacious interior. Engine options for the 2015 Edge include a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 producing 245 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 producing 285 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 producing 315 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Edge's stylish design, comfortable ride, and available technology features. Common complaints include the MyFord Touch infotainment system (though updated for 2015), some reported reliability concerns, and somewhat uninspired handling.

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking into the cylinders, leading to white smoke from the exhaust, rough running, and eventually engine failure. This is often due to a cracked cylinder head or block.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the engine, as the damage is often too extensive to repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling noises from the engine bay, and potentially check engine light illumination. This can be due to oil starvation or bearing failure within the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure (Internal)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, and potential engine damage. The water pump is located internally, making replacement labor intensive.
    *   Solution: Water pump replacement, which often requires significant disassembly of the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks, often from the valve cover gaskets or the oil pan.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, especially when cold. May be accompanied by a "thunking" noise.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Can be caused by worn stabilizer bar links or bushings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension components, such as stabilizer bar links, bushings, or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MyFord Touch/MyLincoln Touch Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: System freezes, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation errors. (Note: Although Ford offered a Sync 3 upgrade as a dealer installed option, this section applies to vehicles that did not receive this upgrade.)
    *   Solution: Software updates. If software updates fail, replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power liftgate not opening or closing properly, or making unusual noises. This can be due to a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty liftgate components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks into Tail Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Condensation or water accumulation inside the tail light housings.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the tail light assemblies or resealing the existing ones.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof getting stuck, making grinding noises, or leaking water.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and lubricating the sunroof tracks, or replacement of the sunroof motor or other components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford Edge has a few common issues. The most severe issues are related to engine problems, particularly coolant intrusion in the 2.0L EcoBoost and potential internal water pump failure in the 3.5L V6, which can lead to costly repairs or engine replacement. Electrical issues with the MyFord Touch system can also be frustrating. While other problems such as suspension noises and power liftgate malfunctions are less severe, they can still require repairs. The overall cost of ownership can be increased due to the potential for these repairs.
