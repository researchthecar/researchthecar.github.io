**Summary**

The 2018 Ford Edge, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues owners report. The most concerning issues are engine-related, particularly coolant intrusion and turbocharger failures on the EcoBoost engines, which can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues such as harsh shifting can also lead to costly repairs. Other issues like battery drain, SYNC problems, and sunroof leaks, are generally less severe but can still be frustrating for owners. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase and be prepared to pay for potentially costly repairs.
