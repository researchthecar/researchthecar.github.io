The 2014 Ford Edge is a mid-size SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available technology. It offered three engine choices: a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 producing 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L V6 generating 285 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.7L V6 (Sport model only) delivering 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Edge's styling, interior space, and ride quality. Common complaints include some reports of electronic issues, potential for higher repair costs on certain components, and fuel economy that might not meet expectations, particularly with the V6 engines.

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking into the cylinders from a crack in the cylinder head. This causes white smoke from the exhaust, rough running, and eventually engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head or complete engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
