The 2011 Ford Edge is a mid-size crossover SUV that offers a blend of comfort, practicality, and style. It was available with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 producing 285 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 producing 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Edge's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and attractive design. Some common complaints include issues with the MyFord Touch infotainment system, potential engine issues (particularly with the 3.5L V6), and some reports of transmission problems.

**Summary**

The 2011 Ford Edge can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The most concerning are the potential for water pump failure in the 3.5L V6 and the torque converter and valve body failures in the 6-speed transmission, as these can lead to significant repair costs. While the MyFord Touch system can be frustrating, it's generally not a safety concern. Addressing these potential issues proactively can help ensure a positive ownership experience. The cost to repair these issues can vary widely, from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
