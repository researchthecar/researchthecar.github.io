**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion/Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant can leak into the cylinders due to a crack in the engine block. This can cause white smoke from the exhaust, engine misfires, loss of power, and potentially catastrophic engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the engine if the block is cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Internal water pump can fail, leaking coolant into the engine. The water pump is driven by the timing chain, so a failure can lead to engine overheating and potential engine damage if not addressed quickly.
    * Solution: Replace the water pump and possibly other engine components, depending on the extent of the damage.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.7L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of turbocharger failure, resulting in loss of power, unusual noises (whining, whistling), and potentially engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating, rough or jerky shifts, and slipping between gears. This is not a consistent issue, and may be related to low fluid levels or internal wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, internal repairs or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This is often attributed to worn sway bar links or bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn sway bar links and/or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MyFord Touch/Sync System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, blank screen, connectivity problems with phones, and inaccurate voice recognition.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets, or replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $800+ (APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially if the vehicle sits for extended periods. Can be caused by a parasitic drain from an electrical component not shutting down properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve testing individual circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Backup camera displaying a blank screen or distorted image.
    *   Solution: Check the camera wiring and connections. Replace the camera if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Liftgate not opening or closing properly, or the power liftgate malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts, latch mechanism, and motor. Replace faulty components as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin from the sunroof, especially during heavy rain. Often caused by clogged sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Clean out the sunroof drain tubes.
