The 2007 Ford Edge was a popular crossover SUV known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and stylish design. It was available with only one engine option: a 3.5L Duratec V6 engine producing 265 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6F50 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Edge for its car-like handling and versatility but sometimes disliked its fuel economy and some reported reliability issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L Duratec V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The internal water pump, located inside the engine, can fail, leading to coolant leaking into the engine oil. Symptoms include overheating, milky oil, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the water pump requires significant engine disassembly, as it is driven by the timing chain. It is typically recommended to replace the timing chain, tensioners, and other related components during this repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Throttle Body Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electronic throttle body can fail, leading to issues with idle, stalling, and reduced engine power. A wrench light may illuminate on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the throttle body assembly with a new or remanufactured unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, resulting in shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. Sometimes, a full transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary if the torque converter failure has caused internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Wave Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wave plates inside the 6F50 transmission can crack or break. This causes shifting problems, such as harsh shifts or inability to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: The transmission needs to be disassembled and rebuilt with new wave plates.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Grinding or humming noise from the rear of the vehicle, especially noticeable at higher speeds.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford Edge, while generally a comfortable and stylish vehicle, has some notable reliability concerns. The most serious and expensive issues revolve around the engine and transmission, particularly the internal water pump in the engine and the torque converter/wave plate failure in the transmission. These repairs can be costly, potentially exceeding $2,000 - $4,000. Other issues with the suspension, electrical system, and exterior components are less expensive but can still be frustrating for owners. While none of these issues render the vehicle useless, the most common issues can quickly become costly if they are not taken care of.
