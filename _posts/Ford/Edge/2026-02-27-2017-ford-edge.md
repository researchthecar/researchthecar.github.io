### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Ford Edge presents a generally reliable profile, with the majority of reported issues being manageable and not indicative of systemic failure. The most common concerns tend to revolve around the turbocharged EcoBoost engines, specifically coolant leaks and turbocharger performance, which can be costly to repair but are not universally experienced. The transmission is typically robust, though occasional shifting anomalies have been noted. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Sync infotainment system, are also a point of attention for some owners. Overall, the Edge offers a dependable platform, but prospective buyers should be aware of potential engine and electrical system maintenance needs.
