Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2024 Ford Expedition, formatted for your website, based on available information. I'll categorize by component, engine/transmission option where applicable, and include descriptions, solutions, estimated costs, and recall information.

The 2024 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, powerful engine options, and towing capability. Available engines include a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 and a High-Output version of the same engine. The standard 3.5L EcoBoost produces 380-400 horsepower and 470-480 lb-ft of torque, while the High-Output version delivers 440 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Expedition's comfortable ride and ample cargo space, but some have reported issues with the infotainment system, build quality, and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6 (Standard and High-Output)**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noises from the engine, loss of power, check engine light illumination, and potentially excessive oil consumption. This issue can be caused by various factors, including oil starvation, foreign object damage, or component wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger(s). A thorough inspection of the oil supply lines to the turbochargers is recommended to ensure proper lubrication.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on if one or both turbos need to be replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Intrusion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L EcoBoost engine can have coolant intrusion into the cylinders due to a design flaw with the block. This can cause white smoke coming from the exhaust, a check engine light, and eventual engine failure.
    *   Solution: A full engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ (depending on the shop doing the work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R80)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Hesitation or delay when accelerating from a stop or when downshifting. Some owners report a "clunking" noise during shifts.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update (reprogramming the transmission control module - TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body replacement or full transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ for software update; $800 - $1500+ for valve body replacement; $5,000 - $8,000+ for full transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may slip when changing gears, the engine RPMs may spike erratically when the transmission is supposed to be changing gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+ for full transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 4 infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, climate control, and other features integrated into the system.
    *   Solution: Try performing a system reset. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for system reset) - $100+ for software update; $500 - $1,500+ for APIM replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera display may show a black screen, distorted image, or fail to activate when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera connections and wiring. If the connections are secure, the camera itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on camera location and complexity of replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power seats fail to move in one or more directions, or make unusual noises during operation.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty seat motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (depending on seat type and motor location).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sunroof/Moonroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sunroof fails to open or close properly, makes excessive noise, or leaks water.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the sunroof tracks and seals. If the problem persists, the sunroof motor or other components may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ for lubrication/adjustment; $400 - $1,000+ for motor replacement; $1,000+ for full sunroof assembly replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Automatic Running Board Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic running boards may fail to deploy or retract properly, get stuck in one position, or make excessive noise.
    *   Solution: Check for obstructions in the running board mechanism. Lubricate the pivot points and hinges. If the problem persists, the running board motor or control module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100+ for cleaning/lubrication; $400 - $800+ for motor replacement; $800+ for control module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2024 Ford Expedition, while offering robust performance and space, appears to have some recurring issues. Engine problems, particularly with the turbochargers and potential for coolant intrusion with the 3.5L EcoBoost, can be quite expensive. Transmission issues with the 10-speed automatic are also concerning, potentially leading to costly repairs. Electrical glitches, especially with the infotainment system, can be frustrating. Other issues, such as seat motors and sunroof malfunctions, contribute to a mixed ownership experience. The severity of potential issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major component failures requiring significant investment to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and conduct thorough inspections and maintenance checks.
