**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue with the 5.4L Triton V8 in the 2012 Expedition is spark plug breakage during removal. The spark plugs are prone to seizing in the cylinder head, leading to breakage when attempting to remove them for replacement. This can cause misfires, rough running, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: A special tool is typically required to extract the broken spark plug from the cylinder head. In some cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed and taken to a machine shop for extraction. Using anti-seize compound on the new spark plugs during installation can help prevent this issue from reoccurring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the number of broken plugs and the extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Tick/Rattle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 engine is notorious for issues with the variable camshaft timing (VCT) system, specifically the cam phasers. Symptoms include a ticking or rattling noise, especially at idle or low speeds, rough idle, decreased power, and potential stalling. This issue is caused by worn or failing cam phasers, timing chain guides, or VCT solenoids.
    *   Solution: The repair involves replacing the cam phasers, timing chains, chain guides, and potentially the VCT solenoids. It's often recommended to replace all these components together to ensure long-term reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Roller Follower Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Roller followers, also known as rocker arms, are prone to failure in the 5.4L Triton V8. Symptoms include a ticking or tapping noise from the engine, decreased performance, and potential engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed roller followers and inspection of the camshaft lobes for damage. If the camshaft is damaged, it will also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R75)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement with the 6R75 transmission. These symptoms can be caused by worn valve body components, internal wear, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis should include checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A transmission flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300 for a fluid flush, $500-$1500 for valve body replacement, $2500 - $5000+ for a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can manifest as shuddering or vibrations, especially at low speeds or during acceleration. It can also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter is the typical solution. In some cases, it may be recommended to replace the entire transmission, especially if there is evidence of contamination from the failed torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Expeditions equipped with the optional air suspension system can experience issues with the air compressor, air springs, or ride height sensors. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting unevenly, the compressor running constantly, or a "check air suspension" warning light.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis involves checking the air lines for leaks, testing the air compressor, and inspecting the air springs for damage or leaks. Faulty components should be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800 for a new air spring, $300-$700 for a new compressor, $100-$300 for a ride height sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate or operating intermittently. This can be caused by a faulty window motor, switch, or wiring harness.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window motor, switch, or repair of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Ajar Sensor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "door ajar" warning light staying on even when all doors are closed, or the interior lights remaining on. This is often caused by a faulty door ajar sensor located in the door latch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door latch assembly containing the door ajar sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the power liftgate (if equipped) not opening or closing properly, or making unusual noises. This can be due to a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or latch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty liftgate motor, struts, or latch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent or incorrect temperature control in the cabin. One side of the vehicle might blow hot air while the other blows cold, or the temperature may not match the selected setting. This is caused by a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+ (labor intensive due to location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford Expedition can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the 5.4L Triton V8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. The most concerning issues involve the cam phasers, spark plug breakage, and potential transmission problems. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, especially those requiring engine or transmission work. Inspecting the vehicle thoroughly, including test driving and checking for unusual noises or shifting problems, is crucial before making a purchase. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended to identify any potential issues.
