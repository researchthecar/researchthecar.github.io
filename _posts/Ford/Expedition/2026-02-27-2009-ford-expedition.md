### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford Expedition is a capable full-size SUV with a generally solid mechanical foundation. The most commonly reported issues revolve around the 5.4L V8 engine, particularly camshaft phaser problems and the potential for spark plug blowouts, which can be costly to repair. The 6-speed automatic transmission can also experience torque converter issues. Suspension components, especially ball joints and control arms, may require attention as mileage increases. Electrical gremlins like instrument cluster failures and power window motor issues are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, owners should be aware of these potential weak points and budget for their repair. Regular maintenance, especially fluid changes for the engine and transmission, is crucial for longevity.
