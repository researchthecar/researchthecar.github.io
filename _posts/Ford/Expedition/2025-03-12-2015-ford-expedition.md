The 2015 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and comfortable ride. It was offered with a single engine option: a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine, producing 365 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Expedition's towing capacity and ample cargo space. However, some common dislikes include the relatively lower fuel economy for the vehicle class.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine bay, loss of power, check engine light. This is often caused by oil starvation and high heat conditions degrading the bearing surfaces within the turbo.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected turbocharger(s). It is often recommended to replace both turbos at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure (Internal)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak originating from the front of the engine, possible overheating, coolant smell, low coolant level. The water pump is integrated into the engine and if it fails, coolant can enter the engine oil.
    *   Solution: Engine removal and replacement of the internal water pump and sometimes the engine depending on the severity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wastegate Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, loss of boost, poor performance, possible rattling noise. Can be caused by a vacuum leak or actuator diaphragm failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the wastegate actuator or the turbocharger assembly (depending on the cause and if the actuator is sold separately).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably hard or jerky shifts between gears, especially when cold. Can also be from a damaged shift solenoid.
    *   Solution: Transmission flush, replacement of the valve body, or replacement of shift solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving high without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, hesitation when accelerating, delayed engagement of gears.
    *   Solution: Inspection and possible replacement of the torque converter, valve body, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging in the rear, compressor running constantly, error messages on the dashboard, a rough or bouncy ride. Common issues include leaks in the air springs, failure of the air compressor, and faulty height sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air springs, air compressor, or height sensors. Conversion to coil springs is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **SYNC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, voice command malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates, master reset, replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,000+ (Software updates might be free, APIM replacement is costly)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows not working, intermittent operation, unusual noises during operation. This is due to failure of the window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power window motor or regulator.

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford Expedition, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, can be prone to certain issues. Engine issues, particularly with the turbochargers and water pump, can be quite costly to repair. Transmission problems, especially with harsh shifting and slipping, are also relatively common. The rear air suspension is another potential source of expense. While electrical and interior issues are less critical, they can still be frustrating for owners. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a 2015 Ford Expedition.
