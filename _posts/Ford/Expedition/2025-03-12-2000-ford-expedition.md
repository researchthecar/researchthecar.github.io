The 2000 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV that was a popular choice for families needing space and towing capacity. It was available with two engine options: a 4.6L Triton V8 producing around 215 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L Triton V8 making approximately 260 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission (4R70W). Owners generally appreciate the Expedition's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and ability to tow. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, age-related repairs, and some specific issues that become more prevalent as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to stripped threads in the aluminum head. This results in a loud popping noise, misfire, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repairing the stripped threads using thread repair kits (Heli-Coil or Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the repair method and if you do it yourself or take it to a mechanic.

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold, which is plastic, can crack near the coolant crossover. This results in coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to stripped threads in the aluminum head. This results in a loud popping noise, misfire, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repairing the stripped threads using thread repair kits (Heli-Coil or Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the repair method and if you do it yourself or take it to a mechanic.

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold, which is plastic, can crack near the coolant crossover. This results in coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold with an updated design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The IAC valve can fail, causing a rough idle, stalling, or surging idle.
    * Solution: Replacing the IAC valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips or hesitates during shifts, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. This can be caused by worn clutches or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn clutches and/or rebuilding the valve body. A complete transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering or vibrations, especially at low speeds. It can also cause the transmission to overheat.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air suspension system can fail due to leaks in the air springs, compressor failure, or issues with the ride height sensors. This can lead to a saggy rear end, a rough ride, and the "Check Air Suspension" light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air springs, compressor, or ride height sensors. Converting to a traditional coil spring suspension is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ per component, conversion kit will be a similar price

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn ball joints can cause clunking noises, especially when going over bumps or turning. It can also lead to poor handling and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 per ball joint.

**Electrical**

*   **GEM (Generic Electronic Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The GEM controls various functions, including power windows, door locks, and interior lighting. Failure can lead to intermittent or complete loss of these functions. Water intrusion is a common cause.
    *   Solution: Replacing the GEM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

*   **Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working or operate slowly due to a failing window motor.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 per window.

**Exterior**

*   **Running Board Motor Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Running boards may fail to deploy or retract due to a failing motor, resulting in a safety hazard for entering and exiting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacing the motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500.

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, especially in warmer climates, due to sun exposure and temperature fluctuations.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard (expensive) or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+ depending on the chosen fix
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuator controls the temperature of the air coming from the vents. Failure can result in only hot or cold air blowing, or inconsistent temperature control. A clicking noise behind the dashboard is a common symptom.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+

**Summary**

The 2000 Ford Expedition has several common issues related to its age. Engine issues like spark plug blowout and intake manifold cracks can be moderately expensive. Transmission issues can be costly, particularly if a rebuild is required. Suspension problems, especially with the air suspension, can also lead to significant repair bills. Electrical issues with the GEM module can affect multiple systems. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into the purchase price and anticipated maintenance costs. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive to repair, especially if left unaddressed.
