### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford Expedition, particularly with the Triton V8 engines, is known for potential issues like spark plug blowouts and intake manifold gasket leaks on the 4.6L, and cam sync/exhaust stud problems on the 5.4L. Transmission reliability is generally decent, but torque converter clutch issues and overheating can occur. Electrical components like the instrument cluster and window motors are also points of concern. Suspension components such as ball joints and sway bar links may require attention. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these common repair areas. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate more significant problems and costs.
