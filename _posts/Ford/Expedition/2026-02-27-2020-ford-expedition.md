### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Ford Expedition generally presents a solid reliability record, particularly in its core mechanical components like the suspension. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the sophisticated EcoBoost engine's turbochargers and cooling system, as well as potential issues with the 10-speed automatic transmission's shifting behavior. Electrical gremlins, especially within the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. While these issues can be costly to repair, they are not universally reported across all vehicles. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate many of these potential problems, ensuring a more reliable ownership experience.
