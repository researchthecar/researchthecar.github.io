**Summary:**

The 1998 Ford Expedition is a capable SUV but has a history of potential issues in various components. The most severe and costly problems include cam phasor failure in the 5.4L V8 engine, which can require significant repairs, and instrument cluster failure. Other issues, such as suspension leaks and dashboard cracking, are more common but less costly to address. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and consider their impact on ownership costs.
