The 2006 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capabilities. It offered two engine options: a 4.6L V8 producing 232 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L V8 generating 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Expedition's roominess, especially for families and cargo, and its ability to tow trailers. Common dislikes include fuel economy, especially with the 5.4L engine, and some reported reliability issues as the vehicle aged.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 in the 2006 Expedition is known for issues with spark plugs breaking during removal. The two-piece spark plugs were prone to seizing in the cylinder head, making them difficult to extract without breaking. This could lead to damaged cylinder heads, requiring specialized tools or even head removal to extract the broken plug. Misfires and rough running could indicate a spark plug issue.
    *   Solution: Use a specialized spark plug removal tool designed for the 5.4L Triton engine. This tool helps to extract the spark plug without breaking it. Soak the spark plugs with penetrating oil. Replacing the original spark plugs with an updated one-piece design can help prevent this issue in the future.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the number of plugs broken and the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn or failing cam phasers can cause a ticking or knocking noise, particularly at idle or low speeds. This can also lead to rough idling, poor engine performance, and a check engine light. This is due to issues within the variable valve timing system.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam phasers, timing chains, and related components. This often includes replacing the chain tensioners and guides as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracked exhaust manifolds are common, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking or hissing noise, especially when the engine is cold, which may diminish as the engine warms up. Reduced fuel economy and a burning smell might also be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold with a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R75E)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4R75E transmission can experience harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear, or during downshifts. This can be due to worn valve body components, solenoid issues, or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. Solenoids can also be tested and replaced if faulty.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $200+ for fluid and filter, $500 - $1500+ for valve body or solenoid replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slippage, especially when accelerating or climbing hills, indicates internal wear. This can be caused by worn clutches, bands, or damaged gears.
    *   Solution: A transmission rebuild or replacement is usually required to address significant slippage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Expeditions equipped with air suspension can experience issues with the air springs, compressor, or height sensors. Symptoms include the vehicle sitting lower than normal, a sagging rear end, or the compressor running constantly. The "Check Air Suspension" light may also illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air springs, compressor, or height sensors. Converting to a traditional coil spring suspension is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the component and whether a conversion is performed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, leading to a reduced ride height and compromised handling. This is especially common on vehicles that frequently tow or carry heavy loads.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs with new or upgraded springs. Adding helper springs or air bags can also help support the rear suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuator controls the flow of hot and cold air into the cabin. A faulty actuator can cause inconsistent temperatures, with air blowing only hot or only cold, or a clicking noise behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working or operate intermittently due to a failing window motor.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the lower body panels, especially around the wheel wells and rocker panels.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the rusted panels. Address the rust before it spreads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per panel depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can develop cracks, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Door Handles**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Interior and exterior door handles can break, particularly on high-use doors.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Ford Expedition, while spacious and capable, has some common issues to watch out for, especially as it ages. The 5.4L Triton engine is known for spark plug and cam phaser problems, which can be costly to repair. The 4-speed transmission can also experience shifting issues and slippage. Air suspension, if equipped, can also be problematic. Other issues include blend door actuator failure, rust, and cracked dashboards. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but potential buyers should be aware of them and factor them into their purchase decision.
