The 2014 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and towing capability. Available in several trims including the XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum, the Expedition caters to families needing ample passenger and cargo space. The sole engine option for this year is the 5.4L Triton V8, producing 310 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Expedition's comfortable ride, large cargo area, and ability to tow heavy loads. Common dislikes include its relatively poor fuel economy and some concerns regarding the reliability of certain components.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

* **Spark Plug Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, misfires, rough idling, and decreased fuel economy can occur due to the 2-piece spark plug design of the 5.4L Triton V8 engine. These plugs are prone to breaking inside the cylinder head during removal, requiring specialized tools and potentially more extensive repairs.
    * Solution: Use a specialized extraction tool designed for the 2-piece spark plugs. Apply penetrating oil to the spark plugs before attempting removal, and allow the oil to soak overnight. If a spark plug breaks, a specialized extraction tool will be required to remove the broken portion from the cylinder head. If the cylinder head is damaged during extraction, it may need to be repaired or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+, depending on the number of broken plugs and if cylinder head work is required.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Cam Phaser Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton engine is known for cam phaser issues, resulting in a loud ticking or knocking noise, especially upon start-up or at idle. This is due to wear or failure of the cam phasers, which control valve timing. Other symptoms may include rough idling, reduced engine performance, and potential stalling.
    * Solution: Replace the failed cam phasers with updated versions. This often involves replacing timing chains, guides, and tensioners, as these components are usually worn as well. Ensure proper lubrication and use of high-quality oil filters to prevent recurrence.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1800 - $3500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold leaks are common on the 5.4L Triton V8. Symptoms include a ticking or hissing sound, especially when the engine is cold, which may lessen as the engine warms up. You may also notice decreased fuel economy and a noticeable exhaust smell. Cracks are common around the exhaust manifold bolts.
    * Solution: Replace the cracked or leaking exhaust manifold with a new one, preferably one with an improved design. Replace any broken or corroded studs. Ensure proper torque during installation to prevent future cracking.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R75)**

* **Shifting Problems/Harsh Shifts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the 6-speed automatic transmission, specifically harsh or erratic shifting. This can manifest as hard shifts between gears, slipping during acceleration, or difficulty engaging certain gears.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change using the correct Motorcraft MERCON SP or MERCON LV fluid. If the issue persists, further diagnosis may be needed to check for valve body issues, worn solenoids, or internal damage. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) to $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Symptoms include shuddering at low speeds, especially when the torque converter is trying to lock up. Other signs can be stalling when coming to a stop and poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Diagnose the torque converter for wear or failure. Replacing the torque converter with a new or remanufactured unit may resolve the issue. Inspect the transmission for any debris or damage caused by the failing torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Problems (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Expeditions equipped with air suspension may experience issues such as sagging, failure to maintain ride height, or compressor malfunction. This can be caused by leaks in the air springs (bags), a faulty air compressor, or a malfunctioning height sensor.
    * Solution: Inspect the air springs for leaks using soapy water. Replace any leaking air springs. Test the air compressor to ensure it is functioning correctly and producing sufficient pressure. Check the height sensors and replace if necessary. Repair or replace any faulty wiring or connectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ per air spring, $300 - $800+ for compressor replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Rear Suspension Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: Many 2014 Expeditions experience rear suspension sag over time, even without air suspension. This can be due to worn-out leaf springs or coil springs. It results in a lower ride height in the rear and can affect handling and towing performance.
    * Solution: Replace the worn-out leaf springs or coil springs with new ones. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if you frequently tow or haul heavy loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power window motors can fail, resulting in the inability to raise or lower a window. This is a common issue in many vehicles.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor. Ensure the window regulator is functioning properly and is not causing undue stress on the motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The blend door actuator controls the flow of hot and cold air in the HVAC system. When it fails, it can result in inconsistent temperatures, air only blowing hot or cold, or a clicking noise from behind the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator. The location of the actuator can make this a labor-intensive job, requiring partial disassembly of the dashboard.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Liftgate Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Problems with the rear liftgate not opening or closing properly, or the power liftgate (if equipped) failing to function, are common. This could be due to a faulty latch, motor, or electrical issue.
    * Solution: Inspect the liftgate latch and lubricate it. Check the liftgate motor and replace if necessary. Diagnose and repair any electrical issues, such as broken wires or a faulty switch.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Sunroof Leakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sunroofs can leak, especially around the seals or drain tubes. This can result in water damage to the interior.
    * Solution: Inspect the sunroof seals and replace if necessary. Clean the sunroof drain tubes to ensure they are free of debris.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the severity of the leak and damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Navigation/Entertainment System Malfunctions**
    * Description/Symptoms: The factory navigation or entertainment system may experience glitches, freezes, or complete failure. This can be due to software issues or hardware malfunctions.
    * Solution: Try resetting the system. Check for software updates and install if available. If the problem persists, the unit may need to be repaired or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the issue.
    * Recalls: None Found
