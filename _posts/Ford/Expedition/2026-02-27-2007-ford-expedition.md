### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford Expedition is a generally reliable full-size SUV, particularly with the 4.6L V8 engine. The more common 5.4L Triton V8 can experience issues like camshaft phaser problems and spark plug blowouts, which require attention and can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, primarily with the 4R75E, can include torque converter and solenoid problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are typical wear items for a vehicle of this size and age, and if equipped with air suspension, leaks can occur. Electrical issues, such as instrument cluster failures and window regulators, are also noted. Overall, while capable, potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine and transmission concerns and budget for potential repairs, especially on higher-mileage examples.
