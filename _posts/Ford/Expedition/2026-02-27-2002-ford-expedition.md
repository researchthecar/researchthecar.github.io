### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford Expedition is a capable full-size SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The Triton V8 engines, particularly the 5.4L, are prone to spark plug blow-out and camshaft synchronizer noise. Transmission issues, especially with the 4R70W/4R75W, can involve torque converter clutch problems and overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links can wear out, and optional air suspension systems may develop leaks. Electrical gremlins can manifest as instrument cluster or window motor failures. Exterior rust is a concern for vehicles in corrosive environments. Interiorly, HVAC blower motor resistors and seat heaters can fail. Despite these potential issues, many Expeditions have provided reliable service with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
