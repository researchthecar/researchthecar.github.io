Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2002 Ford Expedition, formatted for your website and focusing on specific components and configurations.

The 2002 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options for the 2002 Expedition include a 4.6L V8 producing approximately 232 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L V8 engine which produces approximately 260 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Expedition's ability to haul families and cargo but often report issues related to age, such as rust, electrical problems, and failing suspension components. Fuel economy is a common point of criticism.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, the 5.4L can suffer from spark plug blowout due to weak cylinder head threads.
    *   Solution: Similar to the 4.6L, repair with threaded inserts or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking/Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold can crack, leading to coolant leaks, overheating, and potential engine damage.
