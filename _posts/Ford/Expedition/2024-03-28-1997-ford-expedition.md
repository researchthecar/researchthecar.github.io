**Introduction**

The 1997 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV that was available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The base engine was a 4.6-liter V8 that produced 215 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 5.4-liter V8 that produced 230 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were mated to a four-speed automatic transmission.
