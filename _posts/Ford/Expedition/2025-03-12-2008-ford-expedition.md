The 2008 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. The most common engine option is the 5.4L Triton V8 engine which produces 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. While some owners appreciate the Expedition's roominess, capability, and smooth ride, others dislike its fuel economy and some reported reliability issues. Owners commonly praise the Expedition for its large cargo area and three-row seating, making it ideal for families. Conversely, common complaints include concerns about gas mileage, especially with the 5.4L V8, and the overall size of the vehicle, which can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**5.4L 3V Triton V8**

* **Spark Plug Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs, particularly the original two-piece design, are prone to breaking upon removal, leaving part of the plug stuck in the cylinder head. This can lead to misfires, rough idling, and reduced engine power.
    * Solution: Use a special extraction tool to remove the broken spark plug pieces. Replace the spark plugs with a one-piece design. Some may opt to replace the entire cylinder head.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the number of broken plugs and if the cylinder head needs replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Cam Phaser Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A ticking or knocking sound coming from the engine, especially upon startup. This can lead to reduced engine performance and potential engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace the cam phasers, timing chains, and potentially other related components like the VCT solenoids.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: A ticking or hissing sound, typically louder when the engine is cold. This is due to cracked exhaust manifolds, typically near the flange that connects to the cylinder head.
    * Solution: Replace the cracked exhaust manifold.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R75 Automatic Transmission**

* **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation at low speeds or when the transmission is under light load. This can be caused by worn torque converter clutches.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter, flush the transmission, and potentially replace the transmission fluid pump if contaminated.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, or the transmission slipping out of gear. This can be caused by worn valve body components, damaged clutches, or low transmission fluid.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific cause, which may require rebuilding or replacing the valve body, replacing clutches, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4000+ (depending on the severity and required repairs).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sagging, the air compressor running constantly, or a suspension warning light illuminating. This can be caused by leaks in the air springs (airbags), a faulty air compressor, or a malfunctioning ride height sensor.
    * Solution: Replace the leaking air springs, the faulty air compressor, or the malfunctioning ride height sensor. Conversion to coil springs is also an option.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the component(s) needing replacement and if converting to coil springs).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent temperature control, with hot air blowing on one side and cold air on the other, or the inability to adjust the temperature properly. This is often caused by a failed blend door actuator.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the location and accessibility of the actuator).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power window not working, or working intermittently.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rear Liftgate Strut Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear liftgate failing to stay open or slamming shut unexpectedly.
    * Solution: Replace the liftgate struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Broken Sun Visor**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sun visor falling down or not staying in position.
    * Solution: Replace the sun visor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$150+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Ford Expedition, while offering space and capability, faces several potential issues. Engine-related problems, especially with the 5.4L Triton V8, can be costly due to spark plug breakage, cam phaser failure, and exhaust manifold leaks. Transmission issues can also add to the repair expenses. Suspension issues with the air ride system, electrical problems with blend door actuators and power windows, and exterior issues with the liftgate can also be a problem. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor in possible repair costs. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, particularly engine and transmission repairs, can be quite costly.
