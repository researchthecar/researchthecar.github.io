Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system and battery drain, are also relatively common. Suspension and exterior issues, while less frequent, can also result in significant repair costs. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars. A thorough inspection and test drive are highly recommended before purchasing a used 2019 Ford Expedition.
