The 2013 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and towing capability. It was offered with a single engine option, a 5.4L Triton V8, which produced 310 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission choice was a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Expedition's roomy interior, especially the third-row seating and cargo capacity. The towing capability is another significant selling point. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, which is typical for a large SUV, and some reported reliability issues, particularly related to the spark plugs, exhaust manifold, and transmission.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plugs Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 is notorious for spark plugs seizing in the cylinder heads. When attempting to remove the spark plugs for replacement, they are prone to breaking, leaving the electrode portion stuck inside the head. This is due to a unique two-piece spark plug design used during this time period.
    *   Solution: Special tools are available to extract the broken spark plug electrode. In some cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed and professionally repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the number of plugs broken and the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold leaks are a common problem on the 5.4L Triton V8 due to cracking or warping of the manifolds, especially on earlier versions of the manifold. Symptoms include a ticking noise that is most pronounced when the engine is cold and decreases or disappears as the engine warms up. Decreased fuel economy and a smell of exhaust fumes near the engine bay are other symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifolds and gaskets. Broken exhaust manifold studs may need to be extracted, which can add to the repair time and cost.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (depending on the shop rate and if manifold studs need to be extracted)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 uses variable valve timing (VCT) controlled by cam phasers. These phasers can wear or fail, leading to a rattling noise, especially at idle or low speeds. Symptoms include rough idling, loss of power, and potential engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chains, tensioners, and guides. This is a labor-intensive job that requires specialized tools.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6R80 transmission can experience harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Slipping during acceleration or delayed engagement can also occur.
    *   Solution: The specific solution varies depending on the cause. A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement may help in some cases. In other instances, valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) to $4000+ (rebuild or replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter shudder is a vibration felt when the torque converter clutch engages. This usually happens at highway speeds under light acceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush with updated fluid might help, or a replacement of the torque converter could be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Compressor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some Expeditions are equipped with an air suspension system for improved ride quality and load leveling. The air compressor can fail over time, leading to a sagging rear suspension, a warning light on the dashboard, and a noisy compressor.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the air suspension compressor. Also, inspect and replace any leaking air springs or lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the cost of the compressor and any additional parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power window motors can fail, preventing the windows from operating properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Ajar Sensor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The door ajar sensor can malfunction, causing the interior lights to stay on or the "door ajar" warning light to illuminate on the dashboard, even when all doors are closed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door ajar sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The liftgate struts can wear out over time, causing the liftgate to be difficult to open or stay open.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Running Board Motor Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electric running boards can fail, causing the running boards to not deploy/retract.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack, particularly in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the dashboard, or installation of a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on whether the entire dash is replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Center Console Latch**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The center console latch can break, making it difficult to open or close the console.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the center console latch or the entire console lid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Ford Expedition can be a comfortable and capable SUV but is prone to certain issues. The most serious and costly problems often involve the 5.4L Triton V8 engine, particularly spark plug removal and cam phaser issues. Transmission problems, suspension issues, and electrical glitches can also arise. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, so it's crucial to have a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used 2013 Expedition. A good mechanic can assess the vehicle's condition and identify any potential problems, allowing you to make an informed decision.
