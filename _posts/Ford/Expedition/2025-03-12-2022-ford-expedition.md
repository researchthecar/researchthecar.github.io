Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Ford Expedition, categorized by component and specific configurations. The 2022 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and towing capabilities. The most popular engine is the 3.5L EcoBoost V6, which produces 380-440 horsepower and 470-510 lb-ft of torque depending on the trim. A high-output version of the 3.5L EcoBoost producing 440 hp and 510 lb-ft of torque is also available. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its comfortable ride and passenger space, while some common complaints include fuel economy and occasional electronic glitches.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, reduced power, check engine light. Potential causes include oil starvation to the turbocharger bearings, or a faulty wastegate actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty turbocharger. Inspection of the oil supply lines to the turbochargers is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, hesitation upon acceleration, check engine light flashing. Can be caused by faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the cause and replacement of the faulty component (spark plugs, coil pack, or fuel injector).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the cause and number of components needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (10R80)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifting between gears, noticeable delay when shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse. This is often caused by valve body issues or internal clutch wear.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission software update can mitigate the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild/replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (software update) to $4,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This indicates that the transmission is not properly engaging gears. Can be caused by low transmission fluid, worn clutches, or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid (if low and no leaks are present). If the problem persists, further diagnosis is needed, potentially leading to valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (fluid top-off) to $4,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting unevenly, compressor failing to engage, "Suspension Fault" warning light. Can be caused by leaks in the air springs, a faulty compressor, or a problem with the height sensors.
    *   Solution: Locate and repair any air leaks, replace the air springs, replace the compressor, or replace faulty height sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 4 infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a "soft reset" of the system can sometimes resolve the issue. In more persistent cases, a software update from the dealer may be required or replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (soft reset) to $800+ (APIM replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera displays a black screen, distorted image, or fails to activate when the vehicle is put in reverse. This can be caused by a faulty camera, wiring issues, or a problem with the infotainment system.
    *   Solution: Check wiring connections, replace the backup camera, or update the infotainment system software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the cause and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Running Board Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power running boards failing to extend or retract, making grinding noises, or only working intermittently. This can be due to motor failure, damaged linkages, or sensor problems.
    *   Solution: Clean and lubricate the running board mechanism. Replace the motor, linkages, or sensors as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (lubrication) to $800+ (motor replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin around the sunroof during rain or car washes. This is often caused by clogged drain tubes or a faulty sunroof seal.
    *   Solution: Clean the sunroof drain tubes to remove any obstructions. Replace the sunroof seal if it is damaged or deteriorated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (drain cleaning) to $300+ (seal replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

Electrical glitches, particularly with the infotainment system, seem to be a recurring theme. Suspension and other issues, like sunroof leaks, are less common but can still be a nuisance. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences that can be resolved with software updates or simple repairs to major component failures requiring expensive replacements. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider having a thorough inspection performed before purchasing a used 2022 Ford Expedition.
