Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2011 Ford Expedition, formatted for your website and designed to be as accurate and specific as possible.

The 2011 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capacity. It was offered with a single engine option, the 5.4L Triton V8, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The 5.4L V8 produces 310 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the Expedition's roominess and capability but often cite fuel economy and some reliability concerns as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a very common problem on the 3-valve Triton engines. The spark plugs are known to break off inside the cylinder head during removal, often leaving the electrode portion stuck in the head. This requires specialized tools and techniques for extraction. Misfires can also occur when spark plugs are worn and not changed at the recommended intervals.
    *   Solution: Use the correct spark plug and torque specification when replacing the spark plugs. Anti-seize compound can help, and using a Lisle 65600 spark plug removal tool is the best way to get them out.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the number of plugs that break and if a shop needs to do the work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 is notorious for cam phaser problems. Symptoms include a rattling noise, especially at idle or low RPM, rough idling, reduced power, and potential stalling. This occurs because the variable valve timing system relies on these cam phasers to change engine timing. Failure can lead to poor performance and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chains, tensioners, and guides is the standard repair. Using updated parts is recommended to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts, which is an especially common issue on the passenger side. These lead to exhaust leaks, causing a ticking or hissing noise, especially when the engine is cold. This issue affects performance and fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replace broken bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold if warped or damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R75)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift. These issues may stem from a worn valve body, internal wear, or issues with the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, repairs can range from a valve body replacement to a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Expeditions equipped with air suspension can experience failures in the air springs, compressor, or height sensors. This results in a sagging rear end, a rough ride, and a warning light on the dashboard. The system may fail to maintain the correct ride height.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed components, which could include the air springs, compressor, or height sensors. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension for long-term reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent operation or complete failure of power windows. This often stems from a faulty window motor, switch, or wiring harness.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor, switch, or repair the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Ajar Sensor Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "door ajar" light may illuminate even when all doors are securely closed. This is often caused by a faulty door latch sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected door latch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the rear liftgate opening or closing properly, including issues with the power liftgate motor or latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Replace the liftgate motor, latch, or associated sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC system may blow hot air on one side and cold air on the other, or have limited temperature control. This is often caused by a faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Replace the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Ford Expedition, while spacious and capable, can suffer from some notable issues. The 5.4L Triton V8 engine is particularly prone to spark plug and cam phaser problems, which can be costly to repair. Air suspension issues are also a concern for equipped models. While some electrical and interior issues exist, the engine and suspension components are the most significant areas of potential expense and concern for prospective buyers. While the common issues may not be the end of the world, they are certainly something to consider, as they will add more expenses to the vehicle overall.
