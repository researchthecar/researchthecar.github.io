### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford Expedition is a capable and generally reliable full-size SUV, especially concerning its V8 engines and automatic transmissions, though specific issues like spark plug blowout on the Triton engines and potential transmission wear at higher mileage should be considered. Suspension components like ball joints and wheel bearings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the BCM and alternator, can arise. While not immune to age-related problems, a well-maintained 2003 Expedition can still offer good service, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas.
