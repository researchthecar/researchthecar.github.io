The 2005 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capability. It offers seating for up to eight passengers and plenty of cargo space, making it a popular choice for families. Owners appreciate its truck-like capabilities combined with a comfortable interior. However, some common complaints include poor fuel economy, age-related maintenance issues, and some reliability concerns. The 2005 Expedition was available with two engine options: a 4.6L Triton V8 producing 232 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L Triton V8 producing 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
