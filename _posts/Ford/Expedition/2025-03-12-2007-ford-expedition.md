Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2007 Ford Expedition, categorized and formatted as requested.

The 2007 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capacity. Engine options for this year include a 5.4L Triton V8 engine producing 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. It came with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the vehicle's size and ability to haul passengers and cargo, along with its relatively smooth ride. Common dislikes include fuel economy and some reliability concerns related to its age.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues/Ejection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can break off during removal, especially when the engine is cold. This is due to a two-piece spark plug design that was used in some 5.4L engines from this era, the design of the two-piece spark plug can cause the end of the spark plug to break off inside the cylinder head when removing it, due to carbon build-up. The vehicle will likely run rough and have a misfire.
    *   Solution: Special extraction tools are often required to remove broken spark plugs. Ford recommends replacing all spark plugs at once, using an updated one-piece design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of broken plugs and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking, rattling, or knocking noises from the engine, particularly on startup or at idle. Loss of power, rough running, and potential stalling. This is often caused by worn or failing cam phasers, which are part of the variable valve timing (VVT) system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chain, tensioners, and guides is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whistling or hissing noises from the engine compartment, especially on cold starts. Reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, and a potential check engine light. This is often due to cracks or warping in the intake manifold.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R75 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Slipping between gears or delayed engagement.
    *   Solution: Could be due to low transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or wear and tear on internal components. Fluid flush and filter replacement may help, but a valve body rebuild or transmission replacement could be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,500+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revs up without corresponding acceleration. Difficulty shifting into gear, or the transmission slipping out of gear while driving.
    *   Solution: Could be low transmission fluid, worn clutches or bands, or a faulty torque converter. Internal inspection, rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one side or in the rear, compressor not running, or "ride height control" warning light illuminated. This can be due to leaks in the air springs (air bags), a failing compressor, or issues with the ride height sensors.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking air springs, compressor, or ride height sensors as needed. Some owners convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per air spring, $400 - $1000+ for compressor, $1000+ for coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear end of the vehicle sits lower than normal.
    *   Solution: Replace rear leaf springs with a new or heavy-duty spring. Install air bags inside the coil springs
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or thumping noises from behind the dashboard. Inconsistent temperature control, with hot air blowing on one side and cold air on the other, or vice versa.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (depending on labor and location of the actuator)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning, flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Could be due to a faulty cluster or wiring issues. Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate/Tailgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the liftgate. The liftgate not staying open.
    *   Solution: Replace liftgate struts/supports.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin through the sunroof. Staining on the headliner.
    *   Solution: Clean the sunroof drain tubes and remove any debris blocking the water flow. Re-seal the sunroof if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford Expedition, while a capable and spacious SUV, can suffer from several common issues related to its age and design. The most significant concerns revolve around the 5.4L Triton V8 engine (spark plug issues, cam phaser problems) and the 6R75 transmission (harsh shifting, slipping). Suspension and electrical problems, while less severe, can also be costly to repair. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand dollars for engine or transmission overhauls.
