Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2009 Ford Expedition, categorized by component and engine/transmission options. The 2009 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness and towing capacity. The sole engine option is a 5.4L Triton V8 engine producing 310 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Expedition's comfortable ride and ample cargo space, but some common complaints include fuel economy and reports of specific mechanical problems, which will be detailed below.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues (Specific to 3-Valve Design)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting, rough idling, misfires, and potentially engine knocking. The two-piece spark plug design used in some early 5.4L Triton engines are prone to breaking when being removed, leaving part of the plug stuck in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Special tools are required to extract the broken spark plug. Some mechanics recommend attempting removal only when the engine is warm to reduce the risk of breakage. Anti-seize compound should be used on installation of new plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the number of broken plugs and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise from the engine, especially at idle or low RPMs. Loss of power, poor fuel economy, and potential stalling may also occur. This is due to wear and tear, oil sludge buildup, or faulty components within the cam phaser system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers, timing chain, timing chain guides, and potentially the variable valve timing (VVT) solenoid. An oil change may also be necessary to clean out the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noise from the engine, especially when cold. The noise typically subsides as the engine warms up. This can be due to cracked exhaust manifolds or broken exhaust manifold bolts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold and/or broken bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R75)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation, especially at highway speeds or under light acceleration. This is due to the torque converter clutch not engaging or disengaging smoothly.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with a specific friction modifier additive may resolve the issue. In some cases, the torque converter needs to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a fluid flush. $800 - $2000+ for a torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays when shifting gears, or harsh and abrupt shifts. This can be caused by worn valve body components, low transmission fluid, or internal transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Check and top off transmission fluid. If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for fluid. $500 - $1500 for valve body. $2500 - $5000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, especially overnight, compressor running constantly, or suspension failure message on the dashboard. Air springs can leak, the compressor can fail, or the height sensors can malfunction.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking air springs, failed compressor, or faulty height sensors. Some owners opt to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per air spring. $500 - $1000+ for the compressor. $500 - $2000+ for coil spring conversion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window/Door Lock Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of power windows or door locks. Can be caused by faulty window motors, door lock actuators, or wiring problems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty window motor or door lock actuator. Diagnosis and repair of any wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per window/door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the parasitic draw. Common culprits include the radio, amplifier, or alarm system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the rear liftgate. This can be due to a faulty liftgate actuator, worn hinges, or a malfunctioning latch.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate actuator, hinges, or latch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: One side of the vehicle blows cold air while the other blows hot, or the temperature is not consistent. This is due to a faulty blend door actuator that controls the flow of air over the heater core or evaporator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford Expedition can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues mentioned above. The most concerning issues are related to the 5.4L Triton V8 engine, especially the spark plug issue, cam phaser problems, and exhaust manifold leaks, which can be expensive to repair. Air suspension issues (if equipped) and transmission problems can also lead to significant repair costs. Checking for these issues during a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended.
