**2008 Ford Expedition**

The 2008 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV that was offered with two engine options: a 4.6L V8 and a 5.4L V8. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. The Expedition was praised for its spacious cabin, powerful engines, and towing capabilities. However, it also had some common issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

* **Spark Plug Blowout:** The spark plugs can blow out of the cylinder head, causing a loss of compression and engine damage. Symptoms include a rough idle, loss of power, and engine knocking. The solution is to replace the spark plugs and repair the damaged cylinder head. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Timing Chain Failure:** The timing chain can stretch or break, causing the engine to lose timing and potentially causing catastrophic damage. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, rough idling, and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the timing chain. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500+.
* **Intake Manifold Failure:** The intake manifold can crack or warp, causing vacuum leaks and engine performance issues. Symptoms include a rough idle, loss of power, and increased fuel consumption. The solution is to replace the intake manifold. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000.

**5.4L V8**

* **Cam Phaser Failure:** The cam phasers can fail, causing the engine to lose timing and run rough. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, rough idling, and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the cam phasers. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Spark Plug Blowout:** The spark plugs can blow out of the cylinder head, causing a loss of compression and engine damage. Symptoms include a rough idle, loss of power, and engine knocking. The solution is to replace the spark plugs and repair the damaged cylinder head. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $2,000+.
* **Valve Seat Recession:** The valve seats can recede into the cylinder head, causing a loss of compression and engine damage. Symptoms include a loss of power, increased oil consumption, and smoking from the exhaust. The solution is to replace the cylinder heads. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000 - $3,000+.

**Transmission**

* **6-Speed Automatic Transmission:**

* **Torque Converter Shudder:** The torque converter can shudder or vibrate when the transmission is shifting gears. Symptoms include a shuddering sensation when accelerating or shifting gears. The solution is to replace the torque converter. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000 - $1,500.
* **Transmission Fluid Leak:** The transmission can develop a leak from the pan, lines, or seals. Symptoms include a lack of transmission fluid on the dipstick and fluid spots under the vehicle. The solution is to repair the leak. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the location of the leak.
* **Shifting Problems:** The transmission may have difficulty shifting gears or shifting gears erratically. Symptoms include delayed or rough shifts, slipping gears, and a lack of response from the transmission. The solution is to have the transmission diagnosed and repaired. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the severity of the issue.

**Suspension**

* **Rear Axle Seal Leak:** The rear axle seals can leak, causing a loss of rear differential fluid. Symptoms include a whining noise from the rear axle, fluid spots under the vehicle, and a reduction in rear-wheel traction. The solution is to replace the rear axle seals. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500.
* **Front Suspension Noise:** The front suspension can develop a clunking or rattling noise when driving over rough roads. The solution is to inspect the suspension components, such as the ball joints, control arms, and sway bar links, and replace any worn or damaged parts. Estimated cost to fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on which components need to be replaced.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain quickly due to a parasitic draw. Symptoms include a dead battery after the vehicle has been parked for an extended period. The solution is to find the source of the parasitic draw and repair the issue. Estimated cost to fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail to charge the battery, causing electrical problems and a dead battery. Symptoms include dim lights, a loss of electrical power, and a battery that fails to recharge. The solution is to replace the alternator. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000.
* **Window Motor Failure:** The window motors can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Symptoms include difficulty opening or closing the windows, windows that move slowly or erratically, and windows that get stuck in the open or closed position. The solution is to replace the window motors. Estimated cost to fix: $200 - $500+ per window.
