The 2001 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spaciousness, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 4.6L Triton V8 producing around 232 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L Triton V8 producing around 260 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4R70W four-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Expedition's ability to haul large families and cargo, but common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy, age-related mechanical issues, and the vehicle's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to insufficient thread engagement. This often results in a loud popping noise, misfire, and potential damage to the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads in the cylinder head using a thread repair insert kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil). In severe cases, the cylinder head may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the repair method and if the cylinder head needs to be replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold is prone to cracking, especially around the coolant crossover passages. This can cause coolant leaks, overheating, and rough running.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold with an updated design or a metal aftermarket option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

**Summary**
The 2001 Ford Expedition, while a capable and spacious SUV, is prone to several age-related issues. Engine problems such as spark plug blowout and intake manifold cracks are common, and transmission issues can range from minor slipping to complete failure. Suspension issues, particularly with the air suspension system, can also be costly to repair. Electrical and interior problems, while less severe, can still be a nuisance. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for potential repairs. Severity ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and costs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
