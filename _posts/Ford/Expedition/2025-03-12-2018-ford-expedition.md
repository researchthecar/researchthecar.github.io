The 2018 Ford Expedition marked the beginning of the fourth generation, offering a more modern design, improved technology, and enhanced performance. It came standard with a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5L EcoBoost produced 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque in the XLT and Limited trims, and 400 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque in the Platinum trim. Many owners appreciate the Expedition's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and strong towing capability. Common complaints include the complexity of the infotainment system and some reliability concerns, particularly with the 10-speed transmission.
