### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Ford Expedition is a capable full-size SUV with a generally robust mechanical foundation. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the Triton V8 engines, specifically the risk of spark plug blowout and intake manifold leaks. The 4R70W transmission can also experience torque converter or overdrive band failures. Suspension components like ball joints and wheel bearings are common wear items. Electrical gremlins can manifest as instrument cluster malfunctions or power window failures. While interior issues are less common, HVAC blend door actuators can fail. Despite these potential problems, with diligent maintenance and addressing issues promptly, the 2000 Expedition can remain a reliable vehicle for its intended purpose.
