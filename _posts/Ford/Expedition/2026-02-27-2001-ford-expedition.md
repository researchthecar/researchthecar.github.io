### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford Expedition is a capable full-size SUV, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the Triton V8 engines, such as intake manifold leaks and spark plug blowouts. Transmission issues, while not universal, can arise, especially with the torque converter clutch solenoid or overdrive band. Suspension components like ball joints and sway bar links may require attention on higher-mileage examples.
