The 2021 Ford Expedition is a large, body-on-frame SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine, and towing capabilities. Available trims range from the base XL STX to the luxurious Platinum. Powertrain options include a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine tuned to different power levels, and a 10-speed automatic transmission is standard across the range. The standard 3.5L EcoBoost V6 produces 375 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque, while higher trims offer a version with 400 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque. A High-Output version with 440 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque was available on the Timberline trim. Owners often praise the Expedition for its comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and strong performance, but some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, electrical glitches, and occasional engine-related problems.

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Clunking noises can also be heard during gear changes. This can be caused by valve body issues, solenoids, or internal transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the specific cause of the shifting issue. This may involve replacing the valve body, solenoids, or performing a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $6,000+ depending on the severity and extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay when shifting into drive or reverse. This can be accompanied by a hesitation or slipping sensation.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the cause, which may involve checking the transmission fluid level and condition, testing the solenoids, or inspecting the internal components. Repair options range from fluid replacement to valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+ depending on the problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine RPMs increase without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This can occur during acceleration or when attempting to maintain a constant speed. The transmission may also feel like it is "slipping" between gears.
    *   Solution: This typically requires a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ depending on the problem.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag (Especially with Towing Package)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sags, especially when towing or carrying heavy loads. This can negatively affect handling, ride quality, and headlight alignment.
    *   Solution: Upgrading the rear suspension with heavier-duty springs, air springs, or a suspension leveling kit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Knocking/Clunking Noises from Suspension**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or clunking noises emanating from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn-out sway bar links, ball joints, or bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspection of the suspension components to identify the source of the noise, followed by replacement of the worn-out parts.

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford Expedition presents a mixed bag of potential issues. Engine and transmission problems, while not universally experienced, can be costly to repair, especially issues such as cam phaser failure and transmission slipping. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system are a fairly common complaint, although often resolved with software updates. Suspension and exterior issues are less frequent but can still contribute to overall ownership costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used 2021 Expedition before purchase. Addressing smaller issues promptly can prevent them from escalating into more expensive repairs.
