**Summary**

The 2016 Ford Expedition, while generally reliable, can experience several issues that owners should be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the 3.5L EcoBoost engine and the 6-speed automatic transmission. Turbocharger failures and harsh shifting/slipping are common and can be costly to repair. Electrical issues with the Sync system and air suspension problems (if equipped) are also frequently reported. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as turbocharger or transmission replacement, can be quite costly. Therefore, a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2016 Expedition, and regular maintenance is essential to minimize potential problems.
