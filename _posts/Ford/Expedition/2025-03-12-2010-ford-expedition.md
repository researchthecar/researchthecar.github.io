The 2010 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capability. It came with two engine options: a 5.4L Triton V8 producing 310 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque and a 4.6L Triton V8 producing 248 horsepower and 294 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Expedition for its roomy cabin, especially the third-row seat, and its ability to haul cargo and passengers. Some common complaints included lower-than-average fuel economy, especially with the 5.4L engine, and some reliability concerns related to specific components.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult starting, rough idling, misfires. A common issue with the 5.4L 3V Triton engine is spark plugs breaking upon removal due to a two-piece design and carbon buildup in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Using a specialized spark plug extractor tool to remove the broken plugs. Replacing with updated one-piece spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the number of broken plugs and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine rattling noise, especially at idle or low speeds. Loss of power, poor fuel economy, and potential stalling. This is due to worn or damaged cam phasers in the variable valve timing (VVT) system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chain, tensioners, and guides. Often includes oil pump replacement as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noise, especially when the engine is cold. Smell of exhaust fumes inside the cabin. Decreased fuel economy. This is often caused by warped or cracked exhaust manifolds.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifolds and gaskets. Broken exhaust manifold bolts are a common problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear or during downshifts. Can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: May require a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. In some cases, a valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or vibrating sensation, especially at highway speeds under light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush with a fluid specifically formulated to address torque converter shudder. In some cases, torque converter replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $1,000+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, especially overnight. Compressor failing to inflate the air springs, resulting in a bumpy ride. "Check Air Suspension" warning light. Leaks in the air lines or air springs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty air springs, air compressor, or air lines. Converting to a coil spring suspension is also an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per air spring, $500 - $1,000+ for the compressor. Coil spring conversion $1,000-$2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end of the vehicle sits noticeably lower than the front. Reduced ride quality and handling. Often caused by worn-out rear coil springs (especially if not equipped with air suspension).
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear coil springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Ajar Sensor Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Door Ajar" warning light staying on even when all doors are closed. Interior lights staying on. Power door locks malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the faulty door ajar sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window not going up or down. Slow or erratic window movement. Clicking noise from the door panel when attempting to operate the window.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Issues (Power Liftgate)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Liftgate not opening or closing properly. Power liftgate motor failing. Liftgate struts weakening.
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate motor, struts, or latch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (motor), $100-$300+ (struts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking or splitting of the dashboard surface, often due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard (expensive) or using a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $1,500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford Expedition, while a capable and spacious SUV, can be prone to certain issues, particularly with the 5.4L Triton V8 engine. Spark plug breakage, cam phaser problems, and exhaust manifold leaks are relatively common and can be costly to repair. The transmission can experience harsh shifting or torque converter shudder. Vehicles equipped with air suspension may have issues with the air springs or compressor. Electrical problems, such as door ajar sensor malfunctions and power window motor failures, are also possible. Interior issues like cracked dashboards can detract from the vehicle's overall appearance. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues can range from minor annoyances to significant expenses, so a thorough inspection before purchase is recommended.
