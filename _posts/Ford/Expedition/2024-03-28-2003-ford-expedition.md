**Introduction:**

The 2003 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, powerful engine options, and rugged capabilities. It came with various engine and transmission options, including:

- 4.6L V8: 232 horsepower, 294 lb-ft torque
- 5.4L V8: 300 horsepower, 365 lb-ft torque

Despite its popularity, the 2003 Expedition has several issues that owners have reported.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

- **Cam phaser failure:** Worn cam phasers cause rough idling, reduced power, and rattling noises. Replacing the cam phasers and timing chain usually resolves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $1,800+
- **Intake manifold gasket leak:** Leaking intake manifold gaskets can cause coolant and oil leaks, leading to engine overheating and oil starvation. Replacing the gaskets is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
- **Spark plug blowouts:** In some cases, spark plugs can blow out of the cylinder heads due to excessive heat. Replacing the spark plugs and checking other engine components is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**5.4L V8**

- **Spark plug ejection:** Similar to the 4.6L V8, spark plugs can eject from the cylinder heads. Replacement of the spark plugs and cylinder heads may be necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

**Transmission**

**4-speed Automatic 4R70W**

- **Torque converter shudder:** Occurring at higher speeds, this issue causes the vehicle to experience vibration and shaking. Replacing the torque converter resolves the issue. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
- **Slipping gears:** The transmission may slip out of gear while driving, leading to a loss of power. Overhauling or replacing the transmission is usually necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $3,500+

**5-speed Automatic 5R55W**

- **Faulty solenoid pack:** Electrical issues within the solenoid pack can cause transmission problems, such as delayed shifting and harsh engagements. Replacing the solenoid pack is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,200+

**Suspension**

- **Strut failure:** Worn-out struts can lead to a rough ride, reduced handling, and premature tire wear. Replacing the struts with new ones is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per axle
- **Leaking rear shocks:** Worn or damaged rear shocks can cause fluid leakage and reduced ride quality. Replacing the shocks is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per axle

**Electrical**

- **Alternator failure:** A faulty alternator may cause battery drain and electrical system issues. Replacing the alternator is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
- **Electrical shorts:** Electrical shorts can occur in various places, leading to unexpected electrical problems. Identifying and repairing the shorts is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies widely depending on the location of the shorts

**Exterior**

- **Rear liftgate corrosion:** In some cases, the rear liftgate may experience corrosion, leading to rust and paint peeling. Replacing the liftgate is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

**Interior**

- **Dashboard cracking:** The dashboard material may crack and distort over time. Replacing the dashboard is the solution. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,200+
- **Power window failure:** Power window switches or motors may malfunction, causing the windows to stop working. Replacing the switches or motors is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per window

**Summary:**

The 2003 Ford Expedition has several issues that can be expensive to repair. Engine problems, such as cam phaser failure and spark plug ejection, can significantly impact performance and reliability. Transmission issues can lead to costly overhauls or replacements. Suspension and electrical problems can also be a concern. While the Expedition delivers on space and capability, its reliability issues should be considered before making a purchase.
