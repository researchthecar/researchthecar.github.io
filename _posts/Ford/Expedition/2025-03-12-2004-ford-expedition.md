The 2004 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV that offers a spacious interior and ample cargo capacity. It was available with two engine options: a 4.6L Triton V8 producing 232 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L Triton V8 producing 260 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People often liked the Expedition for its towing capacity and comfortable ride, while common dislikes included its fuel economy and size for everyday driving.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can become seized in the cylinder head, leading to thread damage or stripping when attempting to remove them. This can cause misfires and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Use specialized tools for spark plug removal, such as a thread chaser or a thread repair kit. In severe cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed and repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold can crack, causing vacuum leaks that lead to rough idling, poor fuel economy, and potential engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked intake manifold with a new or reinforced aftermarket manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, spark plugs can seize in the cylinder head, causing thread damage or stripping upon removal.
    *   Solution: Same as the 4.6L engine - use specialized tools or replace the cylinder head in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cam phasers can fail, leading to rattling noises, particularly at idle or low speeds. This can also cause reduced engine performance and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed cam phasers. This often involves replacing other related components such as timing chains, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold bolts can break, causing exhaust leaks that produce a ticking noise, especially upon cold starts. This can also lead to reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold itself if it is warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (4R70W/4R75W)**

*   **Shifting Problems/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission may slip between gears, shift erratically, or fail to shift at all. This can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service, including fluid and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnosis and repair may be required, such as valve body rebuild or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause shuddering, stalling, or a complete loss of transmission function.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, it may be advisable to replace the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Problems (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the vehicle is equipped with air suspension, it can experience issues such as sagging, compressor failure, or leaks in the air lines or air springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty air springs, compressor, or air lines. It may be possible to convert to a traditional coil spring suspension.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn ball joints can cause clunking noises, steering instability, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per ball joint
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the blend door actuator can cause temperature control problems, such as blowing only hot or only cold air.

**Summary**

The 2004 Ford Expedition can have some significant issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly spark plug thread failure and cam phaser issues (5.4L engine), can be costly to repair. Transmission problems are also a concern. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, others, such as engine or transmission replacements, can be quite expensive. It is important to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems. Vehicles with air suspension should be inspected for leaks or compressor issues.
