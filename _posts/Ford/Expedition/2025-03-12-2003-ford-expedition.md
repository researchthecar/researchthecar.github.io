Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2003 Ford Expedition, categorized by system. This information is based on owner reports, repair data, and common failure points for this model year.

The 2003 Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 4.6L Triton V8 producing around 232 horsepower and 291 lb-ft of torque and a 5.4L Triton V8 producing around 260 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate the vehicle's versatility and ability to haul large families and cargo. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, age-related repairs, and some specific component failures.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the severity and repair method.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold can crack, leading to coolant leaks. This may be indicated by a low coolant level, overheating, or a sweet coolant smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Ejection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to stripped threads.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads using a thread repair kit or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Phaser Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or rattling noise, especially at idle or low RPMs, that may indicate a failing cam phaser. This is more common in later Triton engines but can occur in the 2003 5.4L.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford Expedition, while generally reliable, is prone to certain age-related issues. The spark plug ejection problem in the Triton engines can be a significant concern, and the air suspension (if equipped) often requires maintenance or replacement. Electrical problems, like blend door actuator failure, are also common. Costs can range from relatively minor repairs like door handles to more substantial expenses for engine or transmission work. The severity and cost of these issues emphasize the importance of a thorough pre-purchase inspection and ongoing maintenance.
