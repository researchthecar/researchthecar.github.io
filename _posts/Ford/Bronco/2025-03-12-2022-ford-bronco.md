The 2022 Ford Bronco marked the full return of the iconic off-road SUV, offering a blend of retro styling and modern technology. Available with a 2.3L EcoBoost inline-4 producing 300 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 generating 330 hp and 415 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L EcoBoost V6 producing 418 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque (Bronco Raptor only), the Bronco catered to a range of performance preferences. Transmission options included a 7-speed manual (only available with the 2.3L) and a 10-speed automatic. People generally love the Bronco's rugged design, off-road capabilities, and customization options. However, some common complaints include build quality issues, electronic glitches, and difficulty in securing certain options due to production constraints.

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford Bronco, while desirable for its design and off-road capabilities, has exhibited a range of issues. Engine issues such as stalling or valve guide problems in the 2.7L EcoBoost can be quite costly. Transmission issues, particularly with the 10-speed automatic, can be common. Exterior issues with the hardtop have also been frequently reported. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes like software updates or bushing replacements, others, such as engine or hardtop replacements, can be very expensive. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used Bronco before purchase.
