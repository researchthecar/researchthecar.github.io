The 2021 Ford Bronco marked the highly anticipated return of the iconic off-road SUV. Available with a 2.3L EcoBoost Inline-4 producing 300 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L EcoBoost V6 producing 330 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque, and a 302 horsepower 5.0L V8, the Bronco offered a range of powertrain options. Transmission choices included a 7-speed manual (6 forward gears plus a crawler gear) and a 10-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Bronco's rugged styling, off-road capability, and open-air driving experience. Common dislikes include some reported reliability issues, wind noise, and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**2.3L EcoBoost Inline-4**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing engine hesitation or stalling, particularly at low speeds or after idling. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: The fix may require a software update to the engine control module (ECM) to optimize fuel delivery and ignition timing. In some cases, fuel injector replacement, fuel pump replacement, or high pressure fuel sensor replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the turbocharger, including excessive noise, reduced boost, or complete failure.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the fix may involve replacing the turbocharger or related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature valve failure, leading to rough running, misfires, and potential engine damage. This issue seems to be more prevalent in earlier production models.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected cylinder head(s) or potentially the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.3L, some owners experience engine hesitation and stalling, especially in cold weather or at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Software update to the ECM to adjust fuel mapping, air intake recalibration, or fuel system inspection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears (e.g., 1st to 3rd). Some owners also experience a clunking noise during shifts.
    *   Solution: A software reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, valve body replacement or a more in-depth transmission repair may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission slips, causing a temporary loss of power or delayed engagement of gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement of damaged clutch packs, valve body issues, or complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Sway Bar Disconnect Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The electronic sway bar disconnect feature may fail to engage or disengage properly, limiting off-road articulation.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace the sway bar disconnect motor, wiring harness, or related sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Steering Wander**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle exhibits excessive wandering and instability, requiring constant steering input to maintain a straight line.
    *   Solution: Adjustments or replacement of steering components (alignment, steering gear, ball joints, tie rod ends).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 4 infotainment system may freeze, crash, or exhibit various software glitches.
    *   Solution: Software updates, replacement of the APIM (accessory protocol interface module), or system reset.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,200+ (software updates may be free)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with various sensors, such as the blind spot monitoring system, parking sensors, or tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS).

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford Bronco, while highly desirable for its styling and off-road capabilities, has faced some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 2.7L EcoBoost (valve failure) and turbo issues on the 2.3L, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues with the 10-speed automatic are also prevalent and may require expensive repairs. Other issues, such as soft top leaks and infotainment system glitches, are less severe but can still be frustrating for owners. The severity of these problems can vary, with potential repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
