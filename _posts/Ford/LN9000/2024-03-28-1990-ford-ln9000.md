### Engine
**7.8L V8 Diesel**

* **Blown head gasket:** This issue is caused by a failure of the head gasket, which allows coolant to leak into the engine. Symptoms include overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the head gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500+.
* **Fuel injector failure:** This issue is caused by a failure of the fuel injectors, which prevents fuel from being delivered to the engine. Symptoms include a lack of power, black smoke from the exhaust, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the fuel injectors. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector.
* **Turbocharger failure:** This issue is caused by a failure of the turbocharger, which reduces the amount of air that is delivered to the engine. Symptoms include a loss of power, black smoke from the exhaust, and a high-pitched whine. The solution is to replace the turbocharger. Estimated cost to fix: $1,500 - $2,500+.
