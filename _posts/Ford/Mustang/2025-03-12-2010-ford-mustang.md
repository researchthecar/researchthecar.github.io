The 2010 Ford Mustang marked the beginning of the fifth generation's refresh, bringing a more angular design and improved interior. Available engines included a 4.0L Cologne V6 producing 210 hp and 240 lb-ft of torque, a 4.6L Modular V8 with 315 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque (GT models), and a 5.4L Supercharged V8 with 540 hp and 510 lb-ft of torque (Shelby GT500). Transmission options were a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic with the V6, and a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic with the V8. People generally liked the Mustang's iconic styling, performance for the price, and available customization. Common dislikes included the lower-quality interior materials in the base models, and some reliability concerns.
