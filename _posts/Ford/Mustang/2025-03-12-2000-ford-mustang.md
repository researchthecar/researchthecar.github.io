The 2000 Ford Mustang is a popular sports car known for its affordability and iconic styling. Engine options included the base 3.8L Essex V6 producing 190 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and the more powerful 4.6L Modular V8, available in the GT trim, which produced 260 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Mustang's sporty handling and customizable options. Common complaints revolve around build quality issues typical of the era, and some engine-specific problems, especially with the earlier iterations of the Modular V8.
