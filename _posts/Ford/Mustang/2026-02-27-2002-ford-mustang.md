### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford Mustang is a generally reliable vehicle, especially the V8 models, with many owners reporting positive experiences. However, common issues to be aware of include intake manifold gasket leaks and potential spark plug blowout on the 3.8L V6, and camshaft position sensor failures on the 4.6L V8. Automatic transmission torque converters can be a point of concern. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods may require attention with age.
