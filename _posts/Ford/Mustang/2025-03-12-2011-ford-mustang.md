The 2011 Ford Mustang marked a significant shift in the Mustang lineup, introducing modern powertrains and updated styling. Available engine options included a 3.7L V6 producing 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L V8 Coyote engine generating 412 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque. The Mustang was offered with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine. Owners often praised the 2011 Mustang for its improved performance, fuel economy, and handling compared to previous generations. Common complaints included issues with the infotainment system (if equipped), interior build quality in certain areas, and some powertrain reliability concerns.

In the affected vehicles, prolonged exposure to high absolute humidity, high temperatures and temperature cycling could cause the propellant in the passenger side frontal air bag inflator to degrade. Degradation of the propellant can cause the inflator to rupture during deployment.

**Summary:** The 2011 Ford Mustang, while offering a significant upgrade in performance and styling, has some potential reliability concerns. The 3.7L V6 can suffer from timing chain issues, and automatic transmissions can have issues shifting. Electrical issues, particularly related to the instrument cluster and SYNC system, are also common complaints. Interior issues, such as with the airbag system, are a concern that should be addressed. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as transmission problems, can be costly. Overall, a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a used 2011 Mustang, and keeping an eye out for these common issues can help prevent future headaches.
