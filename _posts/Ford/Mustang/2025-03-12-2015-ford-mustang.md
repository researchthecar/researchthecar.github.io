Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2015 Ford Mustang, categorized by system and specific engine/transmission combinations.

The 2015 Ford Mustang marked a significant redesign of the iconic pony car. Available engines included a 3.7L V6 (300 hp, 280 lb-ft torque), a 2.3L EcoBoost inline-4 (310 hp, 320 lb-ft torque), and a 5.0L Coyote V8 (435 hp, 400 lb-ft torque). Transmission options were a Getrag MT82 6-speed manual and a 6R80 6-speed automatic. Owners generally praise the Mustang's styling, performance, and handling. Common dislikes include some cheap interior plastics, limited rear passenger space, and occasional reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**2.3L EcoBoost**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive turbocharger whine, check engine light. Potential cause could be oil starvation to the turbocharger or excessive wear on the turbocharger's internal components.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Check oil lines for blockage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Intrusion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking into cylinders, misfires, white smoke from exhaust, low coolant level.  This could be a result of head gasket failure or cracking of the cylinder head itself.
    *   Solution: Head gasket replacement or cylinder head replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.0L Coyote V8**

*   **Knocking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise, especially on cold starts.  Potential cause:  Piston slap or rod knock.
    *   Solution: Engine inspection and repair (potentially piston replacement or rod bearing replacement).  In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption between oil changes (more than 1 quart per 3,000 miles).  Blue smoke from the exhaust might also be present. Could be due to faulty piston rings or valve stem seals.
    *   Solution:  Engine internal inspection and repair (potentially piston ring replacement or valve stem seal replacement).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**Getrag MT82 6-Speed Manual**

*   **Shifting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into certain gears (especially 2nd and 3rd), grinding noises, notchy feel.  Could be related to the shifter linkage, worn synchronizers, or clutch issues.
    *   Solution: Shifter linkage adjustment/replacement, synchronizer replacement, clutch replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6R80 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, hesitation when accelerating. May be due to valve body issues, internal wear, or solenoid malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement/repair, transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Axle Noise/Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Clunking or vibration from the rear of the vehicle, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Potential Cause: Differential issues or worn half shafts.
    *   Solution:  Differential inspection and repair/replacement or half shaft replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MyFord Touch/Sync Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response, Bluetooth connectivity problems, unresponsive touchscreen. Early versions of MyFord Touch/Sync were known for software glitches.
    *   Solution: Software updates (if available), module replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery draining quickly, requiring frequent jump starts. Could be due to parasitic drain from a faulty module or accessory.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic drain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford Mustang has a range of potential issues, with engine and transmission problems being the most concerning due to their potential severity and cost. The 2.3L EcoBoost can suffer from turbocharger failure and coolant intrusion, while the 5.0L Coyote is prone to knocking noises and oil consumption. The MT82 manual transmission can be difficult to shift, and the 6R80 automatic can exhibit rough shifting. Electrical glitches with the MyFord Touch/Sync system are also relatively common, although often less expensive to resolve. Potential buyers should carefully inspect any 2015 Mustang they are considering, paying close attention to engine and transmission performance, and be aware of the potential for costly repairs.
