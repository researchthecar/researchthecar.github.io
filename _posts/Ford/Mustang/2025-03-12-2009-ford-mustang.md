The 2009 Ford Mustang marked the fifth model year of the fifth generation (S197) Mustang. It was available with two primary engine options: a 4.0L Cologne V6 producing approximately 210 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.6L Modular V8 producing around 300 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque (found in the GT models). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Mustang's iconic styling, strong performance, and relative affordability. Common dislikes include interior plastics quality and the live rear axle suspension in non-Shelby models, which can impact handling on rough roads.

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford Mustang, while generally reliable, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues like timing chain problems in the V6 and spark plug thread damage in the V8 can be costly to address. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can also be a concern. Suspension issues like rear axle whine and worn suspension components are fairly common as the vehicles age. Electrical issues are not widespread but alternator and window motor failures can occur. Interior and exterior issues tend to be more cosmetic, with dashboard cracking being a notable concern. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected thoroughly before purchase. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them proactively can help maintain the Mustang's reliability and performance.
