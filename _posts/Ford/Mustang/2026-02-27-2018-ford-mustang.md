### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Ford Mustang is a generally reliable sports coupe, particularly with the V8 engine. The EcoBoost engine, while offering good performance, has a few more documented issues related to its turbocharging system and potential coolant leaks. Automatic transmission models (10-speed) have seen some reports of harsh shifting, often resolvable with software updates. Manual transmissions can experience shifter feel issues. Electrical gremlins, primarily with the infotainment system, are not uncommon. Overall, the Mustang is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific issues tied to engine and transmission choices, and factor in potential costs for addressing them.
