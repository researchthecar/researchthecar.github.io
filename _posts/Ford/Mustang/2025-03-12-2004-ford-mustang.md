Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints related to the 2004 Ford Mustang, formatted as requested. The 2004 Ford Mustang marked the final year of the "SN95" generation and featured a blend of classic styling with modern performance for the time. Two main engine options were available: a 3.8L Essex V6 producing around 193 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.6L Modular V8 producing around 260 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Mustang's affordability, iconic styling, and potential for customization. Common dislikes include the sometimes-dated interior, lower fuel economy compared to some rivals, and the handling limitations of the solid rear axle, especially in V6 models.
