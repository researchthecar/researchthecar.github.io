**Summary:**

The 2007 Ford Mustang is a generally reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it can exhibit certain issues. The most common problems revolve around the engine (timing chain issues on the V6 and spark plug thread issues on the V8), the automatic transmission (harsh shifting), and electrical components (instrument cluster and door lock actuators). Suspension issues (rear axle whine) are also noted. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially expensive repairs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic to assess the overall condition of the vehicle.
