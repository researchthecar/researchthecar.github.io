### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Ford Mustang, particularly models equipped with the 5.0L V8 engine and the 6-speed automatic transmission, demonstrates good overall reliability. The 3.7L V6 engine can experience issues with the IMRC system and occasional oil leaks from valve covers. Manual transmission models, especially those with the Getrag MT82, have a known propensity for shifter notchiness and potential clutch wear. Electrical components like window regulators and the Shaker audio system have also seen some reported failures. Despite these points, the Mustang remains a solid choice for a performance-oriented coupe, with most issues being addressable and not indicative of systemic design flaws.
