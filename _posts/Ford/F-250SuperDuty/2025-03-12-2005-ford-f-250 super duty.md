The 2005 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Available engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8 (300 hp, 365 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (355 hp, 425 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (325 hp, 560 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were primarily a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often praise the F-250 for its robust build and workhorse capabilities, while common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the larger gasoline engines), ride quality, and the reliability issues associated with the 6.0L diesel.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

* **Spark Plug Thread Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can seize in the cylinder head, causing the threads to strip upon removal. This often leads to spark plugs being ejected from the engine.
    * Solution: Repairing the cylinder head threads with thread inserts is the most common solution. Some opt for replacing the cylinder head entirely.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler is prone to cracking and leaking coolant into the engine. This can cause white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and potentially hydrolock the engine.
    * Solution: Replacing the EGR cooler with an updated, more robust design.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Oil Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The oil cooler is located within the engine valley and can leak, leading to coolant contamination in the oil and decreased engine lubrication.
    * Solution: Replacing the oil cooler with an updated design, often done in conjunction with the EGR cooler replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000 (often bundled with EGR cooler replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Head Gasket Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: A common issue due to the high cylinder pressure, leading to coolant loss, overheating, and white smoke from the exhaust. Often caused by the torque-to-yield head bolts stretching.
    * Solution: Replacing the head gaskets with upgraded gaskets and using head studs instead of the original head bolts to prevent future issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Injectors can fail due to stiction issues and cause rough running, misfires, and poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per injector.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (5R110W TorqShift)**

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during shifts, especially when towing. Can also lead to complete transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sag/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially when used for heavy towing or hauling. This leads to a reduced ride height and decreased load capacity.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with new or upgraded units.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Ball Joint Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Front ball joints are prone to wear, causing loose steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **FICM (Fuel Injection Control Module) Failure (6.0L Diesel Only)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, stalling, or no-start conditions. The FICM provides voltage to the fuel injectors.
    * Solution: Replacing or repairing the FICM.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Glow Plug System Issues (6.0L Diesel Only)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive smoke upon startup.
    * Solution: Replacing glow plugs and/or the glow plug control module.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the lower doors, fenders, and rocker panels, especially in areas with road salt exposure.
    * Solution: Rust repair, body panel replacement, and painting.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ depending on the severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Cracked Dashboard**
    * Description/Symptoms: Cracks developing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to direct sunlight.
    * Solution: Replacing the dashboard or installing a dashboard cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found
* **Driver Side Airbag Recall**
    * Description/Symptoms: Takata Airbag Recall
    * Solution: Replace Driver Side Airbag Module
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Covered by Ford
    * Recalls: 21V-024, 17V-001

**Summary**

The 2005 Ford F-250 Super Duty has proven to be a capable truck, but some configurations, specifically those equipped with the 6.0L Power Stroke Diesel, are prone to more significant issues. These include EGR cooler, oil cooler, head gasket, and injector failures, all of which can be expensive to repair. While the gasoline engines are generally more reliable, the spark plug thread issues in the 5.4L Triton V8 are a notable concern. The most severe issues (head gasket failure in the 6.0L diesel) can cost upwards of $6000 to repair. The airbag recall must be taken care of by Ford, and will be covered at their expense.
