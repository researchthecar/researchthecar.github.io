### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the gasoline V8 engines' spark plug blowout and camshaft phaser problems, and the diesel engine's EGR cooler and turbocharger vulnerabilities. Transmission issues, while not universal, can arise with the automatic, and manual clutch wear is a consideration. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can require attention on a heavy-duty vehicle. Electrical system components like the alternator are also points of potential failure. Rust can be a concern depending on climate. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these common issues, the F-250 can remain a reliable work vehicle.
