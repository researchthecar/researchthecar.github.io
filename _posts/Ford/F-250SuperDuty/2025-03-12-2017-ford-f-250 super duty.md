**Summary**

The 2017 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a capable truck, but like any vehicle, it has its share of potential problems. The most concerning issues revolve around the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, particularly turbocharger failures and potential CP4 fuel pump issues, which can lead to very expensive repairs. The "death wobble" in the suspension can also be a safety concern. Electrical glitches with the SYNC system and sensor failures are common annoyances. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be significant and costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used F-250 before purchasing.
