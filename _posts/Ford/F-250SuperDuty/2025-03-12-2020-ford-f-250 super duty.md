The 2020 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and payload capacity. Available engine options include the 6.2L Boss SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 (385 hp/430 lb-ft torque), the 7.3L Godzilla OHV 2-Valve PFI V8 (430 hp/475 lb-ft torque), and the 6.7L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (475 hp/1,050 lb-ft torque). The 6.2L comes standard with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 7.3L and 6.7L are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the F-250's powerful engines, comfortable interior (depending on trim level), and workhorse capabilities. Common complaints include the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, the high price point, and occasional reliability concerns.
