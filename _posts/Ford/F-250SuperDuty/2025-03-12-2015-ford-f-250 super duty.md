The 2015 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a popular heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse reputation. While it's generally considered reliable, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues reported by owners. Engine options include the 6.2L V8 gasoline engine (385 hp and 405 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 turbo-diesel engine (440 hp and 860 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the truck's towing capacity, strong engine performance, and overall durability. Common complaints often revolve around ride quality (inherent to heavy-duty trucks), fuel economy (especially with the diesel), and certain component failures that can be costly to repair.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo-Diesel**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Bosch CP4 high-pressure fuel pump is known to fail, especially when contaminated by water or debris in the fuel. Symptoms include rough running, stalling, no start, and metal shavings in the fuel system. A failed CP4 pump can send debris throughout the entire fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 fuel pump and potentially the entire fuel system (injectors, fuel lines, fuel rails, and fuel tank) to prevent further damage from debris. Many owners choose to upgrade to a more robust fuel pump such as a CP3 conversion kit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system, including faulty sensors, clogged injectors, or a malfunctioning DEF pump. Symptoms can include warning lights, reduced engine power, and failure to regenerate the diesel particulate filter (DPF).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific issue and replace the faulty components (DEF pump, DEF injector, NOx sensors). Cleaning or replacing the DPF may also be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbocharger failure can manifest as a loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and unusual noises (whining or screeching).
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Also check and address any oil supply issues that might have contributed to the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8 Gasoline**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.2L V8 can be prone to spark plug breakage during removal, particularly if the plugs have been in place for a long period. This can result in part of the spark plug remaining in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Careful removal of the spark plugs, using penetrating oil beforehand, is recommended. If a spark plug breaks, specialized tools may be required to extract the remaining piece from the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity and whether professional extraction is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption in the 6.2L V8.
    *   Solution: There is no permanent fix, but replacing the PCV valve and switching to a thicker oil may help reduce consumption. If oil consumption continues, the engine may require internal repairs (piston rings, valve seals).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R140 6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the torque converter can lead to shuddering, slipping, and harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, flushing the transmission fluid and replacing the filter may temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions in the valve body can cause erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. In some cases, replacing the entire transmission may be more cost-effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially with frequent heavy loads. This can lead to a reduced ride height, compromised ride quality, and decreased load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with new or upgraded units. Adding helper springs or air springs can also provide additional support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of the front end ball joints, resulting in clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. It's often recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster, leading to inaccurate or missing readings.
    *   Solution: Replace or repair the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator may fail prematurely leading to a dead battery, dimming lights, and other electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Bed Seams**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust may appear along the seams of the truck bed, particularly in areas with road salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Treat the rust with a rust converter and apply touch-up paint. For more severe cases, the affected area may need to be cut out and replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford F-250 Super Duty, while a capable and durable truck, is prone to certain issues. The most significant and costly problems are often related to the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine's CP4 fuel pump, the DEF system, and turbocharger. Both the 6.7L diesel and the 6.2L gas engines can experience torque converter issues. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are also known to wear prematurely. Electrical issues like instrument cluster and alternator failures are also common. While some repairs are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect a used F-250 and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
