    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) illuminated with codes related to the DEF system. Symptoms can include reduced engine power, inability to start, or warnings related to DEF quality or level. Potential causes include faulty DEF sensors, DEF pump failures, or DEF injector issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the specific fault code. Depending on the code, the solution may involve replacing the DEF sensor, pump, or injector. In some cases, flushing the DEF system may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and abnormal turbocharger noise (whining or screeching). Potential causes include oil starvation, foreign object damage, or wear and tear on turbocharger components.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger inspection and replacement if necessary. Addressing the root cause of the failure (e.g., oil supply issues) is crucial to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or jerky shifts, particularly at lower speeds. Some owners have also experienced hesitation or delayed engagement when shifting between gears.
    *   Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may resolve the issue. In some cases, a transmission flush or valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for software update) - $1,500+ (for valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving without corresponding acceleration, difficulty maintaining speed, and potential for transmission overheating. Could be caused by internal wear, low fluid levels, or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. If fluid is low or contaminated, perform a fluid change and inspect for leaks. Internal transmission repairs or replacement may be necessary in more severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rough Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report a stiff and uncomfortable ride, particularly on rough roads. This is a common characteristic of heavy-duty trucks, but some find it excessive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the factory shocks with aftermarket options designed for improved ride quality can help. Air suspension systems can also be added for a smoother ride.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $2,000+ depending on the solution chosen.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Glitches**
