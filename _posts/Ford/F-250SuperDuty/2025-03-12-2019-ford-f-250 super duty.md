The 2019 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its powerful capabilities and towing capacity. It's a popular choice for those needing a workhorse, and owners often praise its robust construction and comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck). However, some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system responsiveness and the fuel economy (which is expectedly low given its size and power). The 2019 F-250 offers a range of engine options including a 6.2L Boss SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 engine with 385 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque, a 7.3L Godzilla OHV 2-Valve Gas V8 engine with 430 horsepower and 475 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.7L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 engine with 450 horsepower and 935 lb-ft of torque. These engines are typically paired with a 6-speed or a 10-speed TorqShift automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.2L Boss SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8**

*   **Valve Train Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the valve train. Symptoms include ticking noises, rough idling, and in some cases, misfires. This can be attributed to worn valve lifters or other components in the valve train.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected valve lifters and potentially other valve train components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported broken exhaust manifold bolts that cause exhaust leaks, often manifesting as a ticking or hissing sound, particularly when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 fuel pump has been known to fail in some diesel applications. Debris from the failing pump contaminates the entire fuel system. Symptoms include a loss of power, rough running, difficulty starting, and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Full fuel system replacement, including the fuel pump, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and fuel tank cleaning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty glow plugs or a malfunctioning glow plug control module can cause hard starting, especially in cold weather. Symptoms include extended cranking, white smoke upon starting, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty glow plugs or glow plug control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*No Issues Found*

**TorqShift 10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Shift Flare**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Shift flare (where engine RPMs increase between gears without a corresponding increase in speed) has also been reported.
    *   Solution: Recalibration or reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, replacement of valve body components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ for TCM recalibration, $1,000 - $3,000+ for valve body repair or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Death Wobble**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While more prevalent in older models, some 2019 F-250 owners have reported experiencing the "death wobble," a violent shaking of the front end at highway speeds. This is often triggered by hitting a bump or pothole.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn or damaged suspension components, including the steering stabilizer, ball joints, tie rod ends, and track bar.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the components needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Rebooting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC infotainment system can be prone to freezing, lagging, or randomly rebooting. This can affect navigation, audio, and other features.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the SYNC system. In some cases, replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue), $500 - $1,500+ for APIM replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with excessive battery drain, particularly if the vehicle sits for extended periods. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Identifying and addressing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing and replacing faulty modules or components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Aluminum Body Corrosion (Galvanic Corrosion)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While less common than initial fears, some owners have reported instances of galvanic corrosion where dissimilar metals are in contact (e.g., steel fasteners on the aluminum body). This manifests as bubbling or white corrosion around the contact points.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and treating the affected area, replacing the dissimilar metal fasteners with compatible materials, and applying a protective coating.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the corrosion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat heaters may fail to function properly, either not heating at all or overheating. This can be due to a faulty heating element or a problem with the seat heater control module.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty heating element or seat heater control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC system may blow hot air on one side and cold air on the other, or fail to switch between modes (e.g., defrost, vent, floor). This is often caused by a failed blend door actuator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford F-250 Super Duty, while a capable truck, has exhibited some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the diesel variant (CP4 pump failure), can be very costly. Transmission issues like harsh shifting are annoying and can lead to more significant problems if ignored. Suspension issues such as the "death wobble" need immediate attention for safety reasons. Electrical and interior issues tend to be less severe, but can still be inconvenient. Overall, a thorough inspection focusing on the engine, transmission, and suspension is highly recommended when considering a used 2019 F-250.
