**1999 Ford F-250 Super Duty**

The 1999 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its powerful engines, rugged construction, and impressive towing and payload capacities. It was available with a wide range of engine and transmission options. Some of the most popular powertrains included:

* 5.4L V8 SOHC (235 horsepower, 300 lb-ft of torque)
* 6.8L V10 SOHC (310 horsepower, 425 lb-ft of torque)
* 7.3L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel (235 horsepower, 500 lb-ft of torque)

The F-250 Super Duty was praised for its durability, off-road capability, and spacious interior. However, it also had some reported issues with its major components:

**Engine**

* **5.4L V8 SOHC:**
    * **Damaged Spark Plugs:** The spark plugs may become damaged due to excessive heat, leading to misfires, rough idling, and decreased power. Replacing the spark plugs and inspecting the ignition system can resolve this issue. ($150 - $300)
    * **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket may fail, causing vacuum leaks, rough idling, and poor fuel economy. Replacing the gasket is the solution. ($300 - $500)

* **6.8L V10 SOHC:**
    * **Intake Valve Seat Failure:** The intake valve seats may crack, leading to a loss of compression, poor engine performance, and potentially catastrophic engine failure. Replacing the cylinder heads is necessary. ($3,000 - $5,000)
    * **Fuel Injector Sticking:** The fuel injectors may stick, causing engine misfires, rough idling, and poor acceleration. Cleaning or replacing the fuel injectors can fix this issue. ($500 - $1,000)

* **7.3L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel:**
    * **Injection Pump Failure:** The high-pressure injection pump may fail, resulting in a loss of power, hard starting, and smoke from the exhaust. Replacing the injection pump is the solution. ($1,000 - $2,000)
    * **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger may fail due to worn bearings or a boost leak, causing a loss of power and whistling sounds. Replacing or repairing the turbocharger can resolve the issue. ($1,200 - $2,500)

**Transmission**

* **4R100 Automatic Transmission:**
    * **Overheat:** The transmission may overheat due to a lack of lubrication or a faulty cooler, leading to slipping gears, delayed engagement, and burnt fluid. Servicing the transmission and replacing any damaged components can fix this issue. ($1,000 - $2,000)
    * **Band Failure:** The transmission bands may wear out over time, causing slipping gears and poor performance. Replacing the bands and other related components is the solution. ($1,500 - $2,500)

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Failure:** The leaf springs may break or sag due to heavy loads or off-road use, leading to a rough ride, decreased handling, and potential tire damage. Replacing the leaf springs is necessary. ($500 - $1,000)
* **Front Suspension Wear:** The ball joints and tie rods in the front suspension may wear out over time, causing clunking noises, poor alignment, and unstable handling. Replacing the worn components can resolve this issue. ($400 - $800)

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The battery may drain excessively due to a parasitic draw, such as a faulty alternator or a short circuit. Diagnosing and fixing the source of the draw can resolve this issue. ($300 - $500)
* **Headlight Failure:** The headlights may fail due to burnt-out bulbs or faulty wiring. Replacing the bulbs or repairing the wiring can resolve this issue. ($100 - $200)

**Exterior**

* **Door Handle Failure:** The exterior door handles may break or become loose, making it difficult to open the doors. Replacing the handles or repairing the mounting points is the solution. ($200 - $400)
* **Tailgate Corrosion:** The tailgate may corrode over time, especially in areas with harsh weather conditions. Replacing the tailgate or repairing the affected areas can resolve this issue. ($300 - $700)

**Interior**

* **HVAC System Malfunction:** The HVAC system may malfunction due to a faulty blend door actuator or a refrigerant leak, leading to poor temperature control or a lack of air flow. Replacing the faulty parts or recharging the refrigerant can resolve this issue. ($500 - $1,000)
* **Power Window Failure:** The power windows may fail due to faulty switches, broken cables, or a burnt-out window motor. Replacing the affected components can resolve this issue. ($300 - $600)

**Summary**

The 1999 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a capable and versatile pickup truck, but it has some known issues that can affect its reliability and performance. Some of the more severe and expensive issues include intake valve seat failure on the 6.8L V10 engine, injection pump failure on the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel engine, transmission overheating and band failure on the 4R100 automatic transmission, and leaf spring failure on the suspension. While these issues can be costly to repair, many of the other reported issues are relatively minor and can be resolved at a reasonable price.
