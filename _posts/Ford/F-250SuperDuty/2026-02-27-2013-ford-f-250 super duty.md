### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Ford F-250 Super Duty demonstrates solid reliability for its class, particularly with its robust powertrain options. The 6.2L gasoline V8 and the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engines are generally dependable, though specific issues like coolant leaks and camshaft phaser problems can arise with the gasoline engine, and DPF/EGR concerns are noted for the diesel. The 6R140 automatic transmission is also well-regarded, with occasional reports of torque converter shudder or fluid leaks. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, can experience wear due to heavy use. Electrical system components like the alternator and various sensors are typical areas for potential failure. Overall, the F-250 is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of these potential issues, especially when purchasing used.
