### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford F-250 Super Duty generally demonstrates good reliability, particularly with its gasoline engine option. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, has a few documented issues such as fuel injector problems and EGR cooler leaks that can be costly to repair. The 6R140 transmission, often paired with the diesel, can experience torque converter shudder. Electrical system components like the alternator and various sensors are not immune to failure. Overall, for a heavy-duty truck, the F-250 is a solid choice, but potential buyers, especially of the diesel variant, should be prepared for the possibility of addressing these specific powertrain and electrical concerns.
