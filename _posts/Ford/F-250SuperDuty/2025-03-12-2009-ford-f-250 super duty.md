**Engine**

**6.4L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR cooler cracks and leaks coolant, leading to coolant loss, overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler. Improved aftermarket coolers are available that are less prone to failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors can fail due to contamination or wear, leading to rough running, misfires, reduced power, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injectors. It is often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time for even performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $2000+ (depending on number of injectors replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, hard starting, stalling, and a no-start condition. This is due to the HPOP not being able to supply the needed high-pressure oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPOP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The two-piece spark plug design is prone to seizing in the cylinder head. During removal, the spark plug often breaks, leaving part of the plug stuck in the head.
    *   Solution: Use a special tool designed to extract the broken spark plug. Consider using anti-seize compound on new spark plugs upon installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of plugs that break and the shop's labor rate)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, that decreases after the engine warms up. This is generally caused by broken exhaust manifold studs that leak exhaust gas.
    *   Solution: Remove broken studs and replace with new ones. In some cases the manifold needs to be replaced as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4000+ (depending on the severity and solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs sag over time, especially with heavy use, leading to a reduced ride height, poor ride quality, and reduced load-carrying capacity. Cracks can also develop in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with new or upgraded versions. Add-a-leaf kits or airbags can also be used to improve load capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
