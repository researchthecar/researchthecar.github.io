**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plugs Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs are known to seize in the cylinder heads, often breaking upon removal. This can leave parts of the spark plug stuck in the head, requiring special tools or head removal to resolve.
    *   Solution: Use penetrating oil and a spark plug removal tool designed for this issue. In severe cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed for repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the severity and need for head removal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold bolts are prone to corrosion and breakage, leading to exhaust leaks and a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken bolts. In some cases, the manifold may need to be resurfaced if it's warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the number of bolts broken and manifold condition.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (Early Production)**

*   **Cam Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough running, or failure to start. Diagnostic codes related to the cam position sensor (CMP).
    *   Solution: Replace the cam position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (Late Production)**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, overheating, and potential for head gasket failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an updated design. Some owners opt for a delete kit, although this may not be legal in all areas.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, white smoke, and potential for fuel dilution of the engine oil.

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Loss of Overdrive**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission will not shift into overdrive, resulting in higher RPMs at highway speeds. Can be caused by a failing solenoid pack or worn internal components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause (solenoid pack, valve body, etc.). Replace faulty components or rebuild the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2500+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Hard or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delays or harsh engagement when shifting between gears. Could indicate low fluid level, worn valve body, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Check fluid level and condition. Perform a transmission service. If the problem persists, diagnose and repair or replace the valve body or rebuild the transmission.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially with frequent heavy loads, leading to a loss of ride height and reduced load-carrying capacity. Cracks can also develop in the leaves.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if frequent heavy loads are carried.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per axle

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford F-250 Super Duty can be a reliable work truck, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel (EGR cooler, injectors), can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the 4R100 automatic, and suspension wear are also prevalent. Rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify and address potential problems before they escalate. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars.
