**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potentially a sweet smell from the coolant. The EGR cooler cracks, allowing coolant to enter the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler with an upgraded or aftermarket version designed to withstand higher temperatures and pressures. Some owners opt for EGR cooler delete kits (check local regulations).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, decreased fuel economy, excessive black smoke from exhaust. Often diagnosed with cylinder contribution tests.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed injectors. Ensuring the fuel system is clean and functioning correctly to prevent future failures.
