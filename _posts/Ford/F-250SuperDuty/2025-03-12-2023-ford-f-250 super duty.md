**Engine**

**6.7L "Power Stroke" V8 Diesel**

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catastrophic failure of the CP4 high-pressure fuel pump can send metal shavings throughout the fuel system. Symptoms include rough running, difficulty starting, check engine light, and ultimately, engine shutdown.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP, fuel injectors, fuel rails, fuel lines, and fuel tank is typically required to eliminate all contaminated components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system can include faulty sensors, clogged injectors, and DEF quality issues. These issues often trigger warning lights and can limit engine power.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty sensors or injectors. Flushing or replacing the DEF tank may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8 Gas**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6.8L V8 Gas**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears (e.g., 3-5, 5-7), and delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update or recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or, in rare instances, full transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $6,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clunking Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the transmission, especially when accelerating from a stop or during gear changes.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace the driveshaft slip yoke or perform a lubrication procedure. In more severe cases, the transmission may need to be disassembled to inspect for internal damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 4 infotainment system can experience freezing, lagging, and occasional glitches. This may include unresponsive touchscreens, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates are the primary solution, though some users have reported needing to reset the system or, in rare cases, replace the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (APIM replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions of driver-assist sensors, such as blind-spot monitoring, parking sensors, and lane departure warning, resulting in false alerts or system failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of faulty sensors or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Ford F-250 Super Duty presents a mix of potential issues. The most concerning and potentially expensive is the high-pressure fuel pump failure in the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, which can result in extensive fuel system damage. Electrical glitches within the infotainment system and sensor malfunctions are also relatively common and can be frustrating. While the 10-speed transmission can exhibit shifting problems, these are often resolvable with software updates. Interior rattles and tailgate issues are typically less severe but can still be annoying. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase, paying particular attention to the diesel engine's fuel system and the functionality of the infotainment system and driver-assist features.
