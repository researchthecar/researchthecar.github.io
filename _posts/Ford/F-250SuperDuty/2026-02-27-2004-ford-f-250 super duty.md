### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford F-250 Super Duty, particularly with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, is known to have several significant potential failure points. Issues with the EGR cooler, oil cooler, head gaskets, and FICM are common and can be costly to repair. The gasoline engines, while generally more straightforward, can experience spark plug blowout and camshaft sensor issues. Transmission reliability is mixed, with the automatic 4R100 having documented torque converter and solenoid problems, while the manual ZF6 is generally robust. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, as expected for a heavy-duty truck. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and instrument cluster problems are also noted. Owners of the 6.0L diesel variant should be particularly aware of the potential for expensive repairs related to the cooling and fuel injection systems.
