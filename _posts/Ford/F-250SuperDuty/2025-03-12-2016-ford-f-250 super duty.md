**Summary**

The 2016 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a capable truck but is prone to some common issues. The diesel engine, while powerful, is the source of some of the most costly repairs, particularly concerning fuel injectors and the turbocharger. Other significant issues include transmission problems, especially harsh shifting, and suspension wear. Electrical and interior issues, such as sensor failures and blend door actuator problems, can also be expected. Rust can also be an issue depending on the regional climate. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like engine or transmission overhauls, can be quite costly, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect a used F-250 before purchase and factor in potential maintenance expenses.
