The 2000 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a workhorse known for its ruggedness and towing capacity. Available engine options include the 5.4L Triton V8 (260 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp, 425 lb-ft of torque), and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp, 525 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options include a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the F-250 for its reliability, powerful engines (especially the 7.3L diesel), and towing capabilities. Common complaints include rough ride quality, dated interior, and potential rust issues, particularly in northern climates.

**Engine**

**7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **Cam Position Sensor (CPS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough running, or no start. The CPS provides critical timing information to the engine control module (ECM).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the CPS.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Under Valve Cover Harness (UVCH) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, or loss of power, often intermittent. The UVCH connects the glow plugs and injectors to the main wiring harness inside the valve cover. Vibration and heat can cause the clips to loosen or the harness to fail.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the UVCH and often the associated glow plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, excessive smoke (especially white or black), and decreased fuel economy. The 7.3L diesel uses electronically controlled fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) and replace as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector (includes labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Back Pressure Valve (EBPV) Leaks/Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive exhaust noise, decreased fuel economy, and potential for turbocharger issues. The EBPV is used for warm-up in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the EBPV.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8 & 6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud popping noise, sudden loss of power, and engine misfire. The spark plug threads in the cylinder head can strip, causing the plug to be ejected. This issue is more prevalent in earlier 2-valve Triton engines due to limited thread engagement.
    *   Solution: Repair the spark plug threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on repair method and extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, and vacuum leaks. The intake manifold gaskets can degrade over time, leading to air leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leak noise, especially upon cold starts. Broken manifold bolts are a common problem, especially on the 5.4L V8.
    *   Solution: Replace broken manifold bolts. This can be a difficult repair as the bolts often break off flush with the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the number of bolts and complexity of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping, and potential for transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (includes transmission removal and installation)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, failure to shift, or harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, poor handling, and potential for a clunking noise. Leaf springs are a common wear item, especially on trucks used for heavy hauling or towing.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per side (including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Steering play, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear. Ball joints are critical components of the front suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side (including alignment)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning or not working, dim or flickering backlighting.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. Often, soldering issues on the circuit board are the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **GEM (Generic Electronic Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues such as power windows, door locks, and wipers malfunctioning. The GEM controls various body functions.
    *   Solution: Replace the GEM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust â€“ Cab Corners, Rocker Panels, and Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust, often starting in the cab corners, rocker panels, and wheel wells. Salt and moisture contribute to rust formation.
    *   Solution: Repair rust damage (patch panels, welding) or replace affected body panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Handle Breakage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Door handle breaking or not functioning properly.
    * Solution: Replace the door handle.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Ford F-250 Super Duty, particularly those equipped with the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel, remains a popular choice despite its age. However, potential buyers should be aware of common issues such as CPS failure, UVCH problems, and fuel injector issues in the diesel engine. The spark plug blowout issue on the Triton V8 and V10 engines is also a significant concern. Suspension wear (leaf springs, ball joints), electrical problems (instrument cluster, GEM), and rust are also common. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing sensors to more costly repairs involving engine or transmission components. It's crucial to thoroughly inspect any prospective purchase for rust and perform a comprehensive mechanical inspection before buying.
