The 2002 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse reputation. Available engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the venerable 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. A 4-speed automatic transmission (4R100) was the most common transmission option. The 7.3L Power Stroke, producing 275 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque, was a popular choice for its reliability and power. Owners often praise the truck's towing capacity and ruggedness, while common complaints include fuel economy (especially with the gas engines) and rust issues, particularly in areas with road salt.

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford F-250 Super Duty, while a capable and popular truck, is prone to certain issues due to its age. Engine problems, particularly spark plug issues in the gasoline engines and injector problems in the 7.3L Power Stroke, can be costly. Transmission issues, such as loss of gears, require extensive repairs or replacements. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity and cost of these issues can range from relatively minor repairs (e.g., replacing a cam position sensor) to major overhauls (e.g., rebuilding the transmission or repairing significant rust damage).
