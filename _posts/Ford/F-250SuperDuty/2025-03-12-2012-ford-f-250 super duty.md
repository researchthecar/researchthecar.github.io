The 2012 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a popular heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Available engine options included a 6.2L gasoline V8, and a 6.7L Power Stroke diesel V8. The 6.2L gasoline V8 produced 385 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque. All engine options were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the F-250 for its robust build quality, powerful engine options, and comfortable ride (for a heavy-duty truck). Common dislikes include fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine) and the sheer size of the vehicle, making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

    *   Solution: Use proper removal techniques, including penetrating oil and specialized spark plug sockets. If a spark plug breaks, extraction tools may be necessary, and the cylinder head may need to be removed in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the severity and the need for head removal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption between oil changes, blue smoke from the exhaust, low oil pressure.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the oil consumption (e.g., worn piston rings, valve stem seals). Repair or replace the affected components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the cause and the extent of the repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R140 6-Speed Automatic (Used with both 6.2L and 6.7L Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A vibrating or shaking sensation, especially at lower speeds or during light acceleration. Often described as feeling like driving over rumble strips.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter or flush the transmission fluid. A triple flush is generally recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, delays in shifting gears, especially between first and second gear or when shifting into reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. Replace the fluid and filter. Inspect the valve body for wear or damage. If the valve body is damaged it may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the extent of the repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front End "Death Wobble"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Violent shaking or vibration in the front end, especially at highway speeds after hitting a bump.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn suspension components, including ball joints, tie rod ends, steering stabilizer, and track bar. Ensure proper alignment.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ depending on the worn components.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sag, reduced load carrying capacity, uneven ride height.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if towing or hauling heavy loads frequently.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (parts and labor per side).

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford F-250 Super Duty can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues outlined above. The diesel engine is prone to expensive fuel injector and turbocharger failures, while the gasoline engine can suffer from oil consumption problems. The transmission can experience torque converter shudder and shifting issues. Suspension problems such as the "death wobble" and leaf spring sag can also occur. Electrical issues and interior problems with the AC and heater core can also arise. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but some repairs, such as engine and transmission work, can be quite expensive. Inspecting a used F-250 thoroughly and addressing any potential problems early can help prevent costly repairs down the road.
