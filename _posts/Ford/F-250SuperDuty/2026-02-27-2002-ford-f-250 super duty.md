### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford F-250 Super Duty, particularly with the gasoline Triton engines, is susceptible to spark plug ejection and camshaft sensor failures. The diesel 7.3L Power Stroke, while robust, can experience ICP sensor and up-pipe issues. Automatic transmissions (4R100) may develop torque converter problems or overheat. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items on heavy-duty trucks of this era. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster and BCM malfunctions, are also reported. Exterior rust is a concern, especially in corrosive climates. Overall, it's a capable truck, but owners should be aware of these potential repair areas and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs beyond standard wear.
