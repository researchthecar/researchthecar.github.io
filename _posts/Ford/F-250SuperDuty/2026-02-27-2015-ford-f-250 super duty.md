### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ford F-250 Super Duty generally demonstrates solid reliability, particularly with its gasoline engine option. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, has a few documented issues, primarily related to emissions control systems like the DPF and EGR cooler, which can be costly to repair. Transmission reliability is good overall, though the diesel's 6R140 automatic can occasionally exhibit torque converter shudder. Other systems such as suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread, significant issues. For owners of the diesel variant, proactive maintenance and awareness of potential emissions-related problems are advisable.
