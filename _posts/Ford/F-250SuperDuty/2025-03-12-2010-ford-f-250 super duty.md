    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on the shop and quality of the replacement converter.
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Hard or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Can be caused by worn valve body components or internal clutch wear.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and filter change *may* help in mild cases. More severe cases require valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid/filter, $500 - $1500+ for valve body, $3000 - $6000+ for rebuild.
