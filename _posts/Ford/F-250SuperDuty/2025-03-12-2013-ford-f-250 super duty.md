Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2013 Ford F-250 Super Duty, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options. The 2013 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. Available engine options include the 6.2L V8 gasoline engine (385 hp and 405 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 turbo-diesel engine (400 hp and 800 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were typically paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the truck's powerful engines, comfortable ride, and spacious cabin, but some common dislikes include the vehicle's large size, fuel economy, and potential for costly repairs.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8 Gasoline**

*   **Valve Train Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the engine, especially at startup, possibly indicating problems with the lifters or rocker arms. In severe cases, can lead to engine misfires and reduced performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine if the issue is with the lifters, rocker arms, or camshaft. Replacement of affected parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, reduced power, and the check engine light may illuminate. Spark plugs may fail prematurely or become fouled.
    *   Solution: Replace the spark plugs. It's recommended to use Motorcraft spark plugs designed for the 6.2L engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the number of spark plugs replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo-Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, reduced fuel economy, and the "cleaning exhaust filter" message displayed on the instrument panel. In severe cases, the DPF can become clogged, leading to reduced engine power and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF or replacement of the DPF.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (forced regeneration) to $2,000+ (DPF replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, and a "check engine" light. Metal shavings may be found in the fuel system. Catastrophic failure can contaminate the entire fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP and potentially the entire fuel system, including injectors and fuel lines, to remove metal contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $10,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and unusual noises from the turbocharger area.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the source of the turbocharger.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R140 6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially under light acceleration or when towing. Can also cause erratic shifting and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.  Flushing the transmission cooler lines may also be recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation or delayed engagement when shifting gears, RPMs rising without corresponding increase in vehicle speed, and jerky or harsh shifts.
    *   Solution: This could be caused by worn clutches or valve body issues. May require a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ depending on the severity of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sitting lower than normal, especially when loaded. Reduced ride quality and handling.  Cracking or breaking of leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs, either individually or as a set.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the number of springs replaced and the type of springs (OEM or aftermarket).

**Summary**

The 2013 Ford F-250 Super Duty is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine is prone to expensive fuel system and DPF issues. Both engine options have known engine valve-train issues. Rust is also a major concern in certain climates. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to repair, others, particularly those related to the diesel engine and transmission, can be quite costly. A thorough inspection before purchase, especially of the fuel system, undercarriage, and service history, is highly recommended.
