### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford Explorer Sport, while offering a robust platform, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and class. The 4.0L V6 SOHC engine is prone to spark plug blowout and camshaft synchronizer issues, which can be costly to repair. The 5R55E automatic transmission may experience torque converter or solenoid pack problems. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are also areas to inspect for wear. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, can arise. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior HVAC blend door actuators are a known failure point. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of these areas are crucial for maintaining the longevity of a 2003 Explorer Sport.
