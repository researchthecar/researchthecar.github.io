The 2002 Ford Explorer Sport is a two-door SUV offering a more compact and sporty alternative to the four-door Explorer. Engine options included a 4.0L SOHC V6 producing approximately 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.0L V8 producing approximately 215 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque. The 4.0L engine was paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The 5.0L was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Explorer Sport's smaller size, maneuverability, and more aggressive styling compared to the standard Explorer. However, some common complaints include a harsher ride due to the shorter wheelbase, less cargo space, and typical issues associated with an aging vehicle.
