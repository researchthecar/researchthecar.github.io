The 2001 Ford Explorer Sport is a two-door SUV that aimed to offer a sportier and more youthful alternative to the standard four-door Explorer. The 2001 Explorer Sport came with two engine options, the 4.0L SOHC V6 and the 4.0L OHV V6. The 4.0L SOHC engine produced 205 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. The 4.0L OHV V6 engine produced 160 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Explorer Sport's maneuverability, and ruggedness while some found the interior materials and ride quality to be lacking. Common complaints include premature rusting, and electrical gremlins.

**Summary**

The 2001 Ford Explorer Sport has several common issues, ranging from moderate to severe. Engine problems like timing chain tensioner failure (4.0L SOHC) and head gasket leaks (4.0L OHV) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly slipping and erratic shifting, are also prevalent and require significant investment. Electrical problems, such as blend door actuator and power window motor failures, are less severe but can still be annoying. Exterior rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh weather. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues and factor in potential repair costs.
