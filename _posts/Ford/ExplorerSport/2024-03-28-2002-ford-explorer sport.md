**Introduction:**

The 2002 Ford Explorer Sport is a mid-size SUV powered by a 4.0L V6 engine paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Popular for its spacious interior, off-road capabilities, and comfort, the Explorer Sport has also been known to have several issues.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**
* **Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Failure:** The IMRC system can fail, causing engine hesitation, poor performance, and decreased fuel economy. Replacing the IMRC actuator or the entire manifold is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+
* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure:** A faulty camshaft position sensor can lead to rough idle, stalling, and poor engine performance. Replacing the sensor is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$250
* **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Failure:** A stuck or leaking EGR valve can cause rough idle, increased emissions, and engine overheating. Cleaning or replacing the EGR valve is needed. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$350

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** Faulty shift solenoids can cause delayed or harsh shifting, slipping gears, and transmission overheating. Replacing the solenoids is typically required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500
* **Torque Converter Failure:** A damaged torque converter can lead to transmission slipping, overheating, and shuddering. Rebuilding or replacing the torque converter is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000-$2,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure:** Worn control arm bushings can cause clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Replacing the bushings is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400+
* **Rear Leaf Spring Failure:** Overloaded or damaged leaf springs can cause the suspension to sag, impair handling, and decrease ride quality. Replacing the leaf springs is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$600+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** A faulty alternator can cause battery drain, dim headlights, and electrical problems. Replacing the alternator is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$500
* **Battery Drain:** Various electrical components, such as a faulty door lock actuator or a parasitic draw, can drain the battery. Identifying and repairing or replacing the problem component is needed. Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$500+
* **Electrical Short:** Electrical shorts can cause various electrical issues, including blown fuses, intermittent operation of components, and even fires. Repairing or replacing the faulty wiring or components is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$500+

**Exterior**

* **Door Handle Failure:** Broken or loose door handles can make it difficult to enter or exit the vehicle. Replacing the door handle is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$250
* **Tailgate Latch Failure:** A faulty tailgate latch can prevent the tailgate from closing or locking properly. Replacing the latch is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$250

**Interior**

* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure:** A failed blower motor can prevent the heating or air conditioning from working properly. Replacing the blower motor is necessary. Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300
* **Dashboard Warning Lights:** False or intermittent dashboard warning lights can be caused by faulty sensors, wiring issues, or a malfunctioning instrument cluster. Diagnosing and repairing or replacing the problem component is required. Estimated Cost to Fix: $0-$500+

**Summary:**

The 2002 Ford Explorer Sport can be prone to several issues, some of which can be costly to fix. While the intake manifold runner control failure, camshaft position sensor failure, and shift solenoid failure are some notable issues, the severity and cost of the problems can vary depending on the specific issue and the condition of the vehicle. It is recommended that owners maintain their Explorer Sport regularly to prevent or minimize potential problems and ensure a reliable driving experience.
