The 2003 Ford Explorer Sport, a sporty two-door variant of the popular Explorer SUV, offered a more compact and youthful appeal. While discontinued after 2003, it shared many components with the standard four-door Explorer. Engine options included the 4.0L SOHC V6, producing approximately 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and the 4.6L SOHC V8, generating around 239 horsepower and 282 lb-ft of torque. The 4.0L engine was typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 4.6L was often mated to a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Explorer Sport for its maneuverability, ruggedness, and relatively affordable price point. Common complaints revolved around fuel economy, particularly with the V8, and some reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford Explorer Sport, while offering a sporty experience, does exhibit several common issues. Engine problems, especially timing chain issues on the V6 and spark plug blowout on the V8, can be costly. Transmission issues are a potential concern across both engine options. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are prone to wear and failure. Electrical issues, such as blend door actuator and power window motor failures, are also common. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, and the associated costs can vary significantly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase.
