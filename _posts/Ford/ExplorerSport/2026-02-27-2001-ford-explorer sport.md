### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford Explorer Sport, while offering a practical package, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and platform. The 4.0L V6 engines, particularly the SOHC variant, can face issues with timing chain tensioners and intake manifold gaskets. Automatic transmissions, specifically the 5R55E, may experience solenoid pack failures or torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, can arise. Exterior rust is a significant concern, especially in corrosive environments. Interior headliner sagging is also a common cosmetic issue. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair areas and factor them into ownership costs.
