The 2001 Ford Ka is a small, city-friendly car known for its distinctive "New Edge" styling and nimble handling. For the 2001 model year, the primary engine option was the 1.3L Duratec inline-4 petrol engine, producing approximately 60 horsepower and 77 lb-ft of torque. Some models were also available with a 1.0L petrol engine. The standard transmission was a 5-speed manual. Owners generally appreciated the Ka's compact size, ease of parking, and fuel efficiency. Common dislikes included the relatively basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and susceptibility to rust.

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, particularly over bumps. The car may feel unstable or "floaty" when driving, with excessive body roll in corners. The most common worn components are the front stabilizer links, ball joints, and shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replace worn stabilizer links, ball joints, and shock absorbers. An alignment is recommended after replacing suspension components.
