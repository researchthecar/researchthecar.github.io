The 2004 Ford Ka is a small, city car known for its compact size, nimble handling, and fuel efficiency. It was available with a 1.3L Duratec petrol engine producing approximately 69 horsepower and 77 lb-ft of torque. A 5-speed manual transmission was the only transmission option. Owners often appreciate the Ka's ease of parking and maneuverability in urban environments, as well as its relatively low running costs. However, some common complaints include limited rear passenger space, basic interior appointments, and susceptibility to rust.

**Summary**

The 2004 Ford Ka, while a practical and economical city car, is prone to several issues due to its age. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with road salt. Mechanical issues, such as oil and coolant leaks, and electrical problems with the central locking and instrument cluster are also frequently reported. The cost of repairs can vary greatly depending on the severity and nature of the problem, but rust repair and transmission work can be particularly expensive. Buyers should carefully inspect potential purchases for rust and be prepared for potential repairs associated with aging components.
