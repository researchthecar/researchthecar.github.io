The 2007 Ford Ka is a small, city-focused car known for its nimble handling and compact size, making it ideal for urban environments. It's often praised for its ease of parking and relatively low running costs. However, it can be criticized for its basic interior, limited space, and somewhat dated styling, especially compared to more modern alternatives. In 2007, the Ka primarily came with a 1.3L Duratec petrol engine producing around 69 horsepower and 77 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Other markets may have had different engine options.

Engine oil leaks, suspension wear, and electrical problems are some of the more common concerns. Rust can also be a significant problem, especially in regions with harsh winters. The cost of repairs can vary widely, but many of the issues are relatively inexpensive to fix if caught early. However, neglecting these problems can lead to more significant and costly repairs down the line.
