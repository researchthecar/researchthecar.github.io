**Introduction**

The 2007 Ford Ka is a subcompact hatchback that is known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and city-friendly size. It is available with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The 1.2-liter Duratec engine produces 69 horsepower and 79 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.3-liter Duratec engine produces 95 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are available with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission.
