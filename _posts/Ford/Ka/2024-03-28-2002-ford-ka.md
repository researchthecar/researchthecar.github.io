**Introduction**

The 2002 Ford Ka is a compact hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability in urban areas. It is available with two gasoline engine options: a 1.3-liter and a 1.6-liter. Both engines are mated to a 5-speed manual transmission.

**Engine**

* **1.3-liter**
    * **Head gasket failure:** Premature failure of the head gasket, leading to coolant and oil leaks, overheating, and loss of compression. Requires replacement of the head gasket and related components. **$1,000 - $2,000+**
    * **Ignition coil failure:** Malfunctioning ignition coils disrupt spark delivery to the cylinders, causing misfires, rough idling, and difficulty starting. Requires replacement of the faulty coils. **$200 - $400**
* **1.6-liter**
    * **Valve timing belt failure:** Broken or worn timing belts can cause catastrophic engine failure by disrupting the synchronization of the valves and pistons. Regular replacement of the belt and related components is crucial. **$400 - $600+**

**Transmission**

* **5-speed manual**
    * **Clutch failure:** Worn or damaged clutch plates can lead to slipping, shuddering, or difficulty shifting gears. Requires replacement of the clutch assembly. **$600 - $1,000**

**Suspension**

* **Strut mounts:** Worn or failing strut mounts can cause clunking or rattling noises, poor handling, and reduced suspension performance. Requires replacement of the mounts. **$200 - $400**
* **Front control arm bushings:** Deteriorated bushings allow excessive movement in the suspension, affecting handling, alignment, and tire wear. Requires replacement of the bushings. **$300 - $500**
* **Rear trailing arm bushings:** Worn bushings can cause similar issues to front control arm bushings, including poor handling, alignment problems, and tire wear. Requires replacement of the bushings. **$250 - $450**

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** A failing alternator can lead to insufficient electrical power generation, resulting in battery drain, dim headlights, and potential electrical system issues. Requires replacement of the alternator. **$500 - $700**
* **Starter motor failure:** A faulty starter motor can prevent the engine from starting. Requires replacement of the starter motor. **$300 - $500**
* **Ignition switch failure:** A malfunctioning ignition switch can cause intermittent starting issues or even prevent the car from starting at all. Requires replacement of the ignition switch. **$200 - $350**

**Exterior**

* **Door handle failure:** Broken or malfunctioning door handles can make it difficult to open doors from the outside. Requires replacement of the door handle assembly. **$100 - $250**

**Interior**

* **Window regulator failure:** Inoperable windows can be caused by faulty window regulators. Requires replacement of the regulator assembly. **$250 - $400**
* **Heater core failure:** A leaking heater core can cause a musty smell or coolant leaks inside the cabin. Requires replacement of the heater core. **$600 - $800**

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford Ka is a reliable and economical vehicle, but like all cars, it has its share of potential issues. The most severe problems are engine head gasket failure and valve timing belt failure, which can be costly to repair. However, many of the other issues are relatively minor and can be addressed without breaking the bank. Overall, the Ka's problems are not major obstacles to ownership, and it remains a practical and affordable choice for urban dwellers.
