Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2002 Ford Ka, formatted for your website.

The 2002 Ford Ka is a small, city-oriented hatchback known for its distinctive styling and affordability. The most common engine option for the 2002 Ford Ka is a 1.3L Duratec inline-4 engine producing approximately 60 horsepower and 77 lb-ft of torque. A 1.3L Endura-E engine was also available. A 5-speed manual transmission was the standard transmission option. People generally appreciate the Ka for its small size, easy maneuverability in urban environments, and low running costs. Common complaints include its relatively basic interior, limited space, and the potential for rust issues.

**Engine**

**1.3L Duratec Inline-4**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various points in the cooling system, including the water pump, hoses, thermostat housing, and radiator. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the affected part. This might involve replacing hoses, clamps, gaskets, or the water pump/thermostat housing itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include oil spots under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Clean the affected area to ensure a proper seal with the new component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+

*   **Idle Control Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, or difficulty starting can be caused by a faulty idle control valve (ICV).
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the ICV. Check the wiring and connections to the ICV.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, or complete failure to start may indicate a failing crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150

**1.3L Endura-E Inline-4**

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and oil contamination of the coolant are all classic symptoms of a blown head gasket on the Endura-E engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the head gasket. This is a labor-intensive job, often requiring machining of the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden engine stalling or failure to start. The Endura-E engine is an interference engine, meaning that if the timing belt breaks, the valves can collide with the pistons, causing significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing belt at recommended intervals (typically every 30,000-60,000 miles). If the belt has broken, assess the extent of the damage and repair or replace the engine as necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (timing belt replacement); $500 - $2000+ (engine repair/replacement after belt failure)

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Gear Selection Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty shifting into certain gears, especially first or reverse, or grinding noises during shifting.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable. If the problem persists, inspect the synchronizers in the transmission. In some cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (clutch cable adjustment); $500 - $1500+ (transmission repair/replacement)

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage (engine revs up without the car accelerating), difficulty shifting, or a soft or spongy clutch pedal.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing. Consider resurfacing or replacing the flywheel as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Vague steering and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings. Common culprits are the front control arm bushings and the rear axle bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (per bushing replacement)

*   **Broken Coil Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging suspension, uneven tire wear, and a noticeable lean to one side of the car.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken coil spring. It's generally recommended to replace coil springs in pairs (both front or both rear) to maintain even handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ (per pair)

**Electrical**

*   **Faulty Window Regulators**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows that don't go up or down, or that move very slowly or unevenly.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

*   **Instrument Cluster Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges that don't work correctly (speedometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge), warning lights that come on intermittently, or a completely dead instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the issue. It could be a faulty sensor, a wiring problem, or a problem with the instrument cluster itself. Repair or replace the affected component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is a very common issue, especially on the wheel arches, door sills, and around the fuel filler cap.
    *   Solution: Cut out and weld in new metal, treat with a rust inhibitor, and repaint. Preventative measures include regular washing and waxing and applying rustproofing products.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and location)

*   **Headlight Lens Yellowing/Clouding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlight lenses become yellowed or clouded over time, reducing headlight output.
    *   Solution: Polish the headlight lenses with a headlight restoration kit. In severe cases, the lenses may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50 (restoration kit); $100 - $300+ (lens replacement)

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard plastic can become brittle and crack, especially in hot climates.
    *   Solution: Cover the dashboard with a dashboard cover or replace the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $30 - $100 (dashboard cover); $200 - $500+ (dashboard replacement)
