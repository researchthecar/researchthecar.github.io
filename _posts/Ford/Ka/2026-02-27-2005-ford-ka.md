### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford Ka is a generally dependable small car, but like many vehicles of its age, it is susceptible to specific issues. Common problems include coolant leaks and ignition coil failures in the petrol engines, and clutch wear or gear selector issues with the manual transmission. The automated manual transmission can be prone to actuator problems. Suspension components, particularly bushings, can wear out, leading to noise and handling degradation. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern, especially in areas prone to salt. Interior wear on seats and HVAC fan motor failures are also noted. Despite these potential issues, with regular maintenance and addressing problems promptly, the 2005 Ford Ka can remain a cost-effective and functional vehicle.
