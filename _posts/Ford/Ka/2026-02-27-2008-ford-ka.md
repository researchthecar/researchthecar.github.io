### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Ford Ka is a budget-friendly city car with a generally acceptable reliability record for its class and age. While the petrol engines and manual transmissions are typically robust, the 1.4 TDCi diesel engine can experience issues with injector seals and turbochargers. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulator and central locking problems, are relatively common. Interior wear, particularly on seats and dashboards, is also something to consider. Despite these points, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to emerging issues, the Ka can remain a dependable small car. Its strengths lie in its low running costs and maneuverability, making it a practical choice for urban environments.
