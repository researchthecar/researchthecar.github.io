### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford Ka is a generally dependable small car, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Common problems tend to revolve around the engine's cooling system (leaks) and ignition components, particularly with the 1.3L engine. Manual transmissions can experience clutch wear and gear selector cable issues. Suspension components like bushings and shock absorbers are also prone to wear. Electrically, wiring harness corrosion and alternator failures are noted. Externally, rust can be a concern, especially in older vehicles or those exposed to harsh climates. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor and instrument cluster can sometimes fail. Despite these points, with regular maintenance and prompt attention to emerging issues, the 2003 Ford Ka can remain a cost-effective and reliable mode of transport.
