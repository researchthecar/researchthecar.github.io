Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2003 Ford Ka, formatted as requested:

The 2003 Ford Ka is a small, city-oriented car known for its affordability and nimble handling. The primary engine option for this model year in most markets was a 1.3L inline-4 petrol engine, producing around 69 horsepower and 79 lb-ft of torque. A smaller 1.0L engine was available in some markets as well. It came standard with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate its compact size, making it easy to park and maneuver in urban environments. Common complaints revolve around its basic interior, limited features, and potential for rust, especially in colder climates.

**Engine**

**1.3L Inline-4 Petrol (Duratec)**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking from the thermostat housing, water pump, or radiator hoses. This can lead to overheating and engine damage if not addressed promptly. Symptoms include a sweet smell, low coolant levels, and temperature gauge rising.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking component (thermostat housing, water pump, hoses). Pressure test the cooling system to find all leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the part needing replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic idling, stalling, or difficulty starting. The IAC valve regulates the airflow to maintain a stable idle.
    *   Solution: Clean the IAC valve first. If cleaning doesn't resolve the issue, replace the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.0L Inline-4 Petrol**
*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual (IB5)**

*   **Stiff or Difficult Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially when cold. The shift linkage may become stiff or the synchros may be worn.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the shift linkage. If the problem persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt, or have the synchros replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50 for lubrication, $800 - $1500+ for rebuild/synchro replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises, poor handling, uneven tire wear. Common culprits are worn ball joints, tie rod ends, and shock absorbers.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension components. It's often recommended to replace these parts in pairs (e.g., both front shocks) for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per corner, depending on the parts replaced and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Doors not locking/unlocking properly with the remote or key. This can be due to a faulty actuator, wiring issues, or a problem with the central locking module.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the system to determine the faulty component (actuator, wiring, module). Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+, depending on the part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Speedometer, fuel gauge, or other instruments not working or displaying incorrect information.
    *   Solution: Check the wiring and connectors to the instrument cluster. If the problem persists, the instrument cluster may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the body, particularly around the wheel arches, door sills, and undercarriage. Common in regions with harsh winters or salty road conditions.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust, treat the area, and repaint. More extensive rust may require panel replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity and location of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric detaching from the backing board and sagging down.
    *   Solution: Re-glue the headliner fabric or replace the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford Ka, while a practical city car, does have its share of common issues. Engine issues such as coolant leaks and IAC valve problems can lead to overheating and driveability concerns. Suspension wear can affect handling and ride comfort. Electrical issues such as central locking failures and instrument cluster problems can be frustrating. Rust is a common concern, particularly in certain climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like rust repair or transmission work, can be more costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these issues before purchase.
