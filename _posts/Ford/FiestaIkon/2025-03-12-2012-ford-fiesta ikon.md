The 2012 Ford Fiesta Ikon, primarily sold in markets like India and South Africa, was a popular subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability. The Ikon was essentially the sedan version of the Ford Fiesta hatchback, offering a more practical option for families. Engine options typically included a 1.4L Duratec petrol engine producing around 96 horsepower and 127 Nm of torque, and a 1.4L Duratorq diesel engine producing around 68 horsepower and 160 Nm of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciated the car's compact size, making it easy to navigate city streets, and its fuel economy. Common dislikes included the somewhat cramped rear seating and a less than stellar ride quality on rough roads.
