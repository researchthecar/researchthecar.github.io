The 2003 Ford Fiesta Ikon was a popular subcompact car, known for its fuel efficiency and practicality, especially in urban environments. The Ikon, a sedan version of the Fiesta, was specifically tailored to certain markets. While loved for its compact size and ease of handling, it faced its share of issues as it aged. Engine options typically included a 1.3L petrol engine producing around 70 horsepower and approximately 77 lb-ft of torque. Another engine option was the 1.6L petrol engine producing around 100 horsepower and approximately 107 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were primarily a 5-speed manual. Owners often appreciate the car's affordability and nimble nature but dislike its basic features and potential for rust in some climates.
