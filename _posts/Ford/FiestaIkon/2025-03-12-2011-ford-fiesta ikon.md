The 2011 Ford Fiesta Ikon, known simply as the Ford Fiesta in many markets, is a subcompact car that offers fuel efficiency and nimble handling. Engine options for the 2011 Fiesta typically included a 1.6L Duratec inline-4 engine, producing around 120 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices were often a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic (Powershift dual-clutch transmission in some markets). Owners often praise its fuel economy, maneuverability, and stylish design, but some dislike the sometimes jerky operation of the Powershift transmission, tight rear seating, and perceived lack of power, especially when fully loaded.

**Engine**

**1.6L Duratec Inline-4 Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires and Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and potential check engine light with codes related to ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coils and/or spark plugs. Inspect wiring harness for damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Evaporative Emission Control System (EVAP) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light with codes related to EVAP system, potential fuel odor.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace faulty components such as the purge valve, vapor canister, or fuel filler cap.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Powershift Automatic Transmission (If Equipped)**

*   **Hesitation, Jerky Shifting, and Shuddering**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation when accelerating from a stop, jerky shifting between gears, and shuddering, especially at low speeds. This is a known issue with the early versions of the DPS6 Powershift transmission.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Ford may help temporarily. Replacement of clutch packs or the entire transmission may be necessary. Some have reported success with aftermarket transmission cooler installs to mitigate heat buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ (depending on severity and if clutch replacement or full transmission replacement is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Control Module (TCM) Failure (If Equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of gear engagement, erratic shifting, check engine light, or inability to start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty TCM. Note: programming the new TCM to the vehicle is often required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*No Issues Found*

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, uneven tire wear, poor handling.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn components such as struts, shocks, ball joints, tie rod ends, or control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Check for parasitic drains by systematically disconnecting circuits.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (for a new battery), $50 - $200+ (to diagnose and repair parasitic drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Ford Fiesta Ikon has several potential issues, with the most serious and costly generally stemming from the 6-speed Powershift automatic transmission. The potential for TCM failures, clutch pack issues, and overall jerky operation are significant concerns. Other common issues include engine misfires, EVAP leaks, worn suspension components, and electrical problems such as battery drain. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, addressing the Powershift transmission problems can be costly. Overall, the severity of the potential issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures.
