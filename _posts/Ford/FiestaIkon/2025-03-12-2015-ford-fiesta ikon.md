The 2015 Ford Fiesta Ikon, primarily sold in markets like Mexico, India, and South America, offers a blend of fuel efficiency and practicality. While engine options may vary depending on the specific market, a common choice is the 1.6L Duratec petrol engine, producing around 120 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. It's generally offered with a 5-speed manual transmission. Some models also come with a 1.5L diesel engine option. Owners often appreciate the Fiesta Ikon's compact size for city driving and its relatively low running costs. However, criticisms often include concerns about the interior's basic design, limited rear passenger space, and, depending on the market, potentially less robust build quality compared to European or North American Fiestas.

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford Fiesta Ikon, while generally reliable, can suffer from issues related to its engine (coolant leaks, ignition coil failures), transmission (clutch slippage), suspension (worn bushings), electrical system (power windows, central locking), and interior (air conditioning problems). The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially more costly repairs. Coolant leaks and suspension component wear are fairly common but typically inexpensive to address. More complex issues like DPF problems on diesel models or complete clutch failure will require more substantial investment.
