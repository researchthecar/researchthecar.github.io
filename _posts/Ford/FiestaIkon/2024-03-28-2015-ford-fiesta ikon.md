**Introduction:**

The 2015 Ford Fiesta Ikon is a subcompact sedan known for its affordability, fuel efficiency, and sporty handling. It comes with a choice of two engine options: a 1.6L Ti-VCT I4 engine and a 123-horsepower 1.0L EcoBoost I3 engine. The 1.6L engine produces 109 horsepower and 108 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.0L EcoBoost engine produces 123 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a standard 5-speed manual transmission, and a 6-speed PowerShift automatic transmission is available as an option. The Fiesta Ikon is praised for its peppy performance, spacious interior, and comfortable ride, but it has received some criticism for its lack of advanced safety features and occasional transmission issues.
