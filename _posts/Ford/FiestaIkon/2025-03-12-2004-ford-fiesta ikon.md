The 2004 Ford Fiesta Ikon was a popular subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and nimble handling, making it a favorite among city drivers and first-time car owners. However, it wasnâ€™t without its problems. The 2004 Ford Fiesta Ikon in India was primarily offered with a 1.3L Rocam petrol engine producing around 70 horsepower and 105 Nm of torque, and a 1.4L TDCi diesel engine producing around 68 horsepower and 160 Nm of torque. The engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciated the car's compact size, ease of parking, and decent fuel economy. Common complaints included relatively weak engine performance, especially when fully loaded, and a somewhat basic interior.
