The 2002 Ford Fiesta Ikon, primarily sold in markets like India and South Africa, was a popular subcompact car known for its fuel efficiency, nimble handling, and affordability. It was generally liked for its compact size making it easy to navigate through tight urban environments. However, owners often disliked its basic features, limited space, and sometimes problematic build quality. Engine options typically included a 1.3L Rocam petrol engine producing around 69 horsepower and a 1.4L diesel engine. Transmission options were usually limited to a 5-speed manual. This response will focus on the common issues reported for the 2002 Fiesta Ikon, broken down by major component categories.

    *   Solution: Replace the water pump and hoses.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**1.4L Diesel Engine**

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, poor fuel economy, black smoke from the exhaust, and difficulty starting. Can be caused by dirty or failing fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+

*   **Turbocharger Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, whistling or screeching noise from the engine, and excessive smoke.  Potential turbocharger failure.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficult Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially first or second, or grinding noises during shifts.  May indicate worn synchronizers or a worn clutch.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch kit, including the pressure plate, disc, and release bearing. Inspect and replace worn synchronizers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+

*   **Clutch Slippage**

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps.  Can cause poor handling and uneven tire wear.
