### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford E-150 is a generally reliable vehicle for its intended purpose, but like many vans of this era, it is not without its potential issues. The Triton V8 engines, particularly the 5.4L, are prone to specific problems like camshaft phaser issues and spark plug blowouts, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, primarily with the torque converter and solenoid packs, are also noted. On the chassis, suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out, especially under heavy use. Electrical gremlins, such as alternator failure and instrument cluster problems, can also arise. Exterior rust is a common concern for older vehicles, and interior wear on upholstery and HVAC components are also reported. Despite these potential drawbacks, with proper maintenance and timely repairs, the E-150 can continue to serve as a dependable work vehicle.
