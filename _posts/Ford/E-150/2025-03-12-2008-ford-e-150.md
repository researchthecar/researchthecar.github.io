The 2008 Ford E-150 is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, but also popular for conversion into campers. The E-150 offers a comfortable ride, a spacious interior, and the ability to tow and haul substantial loads. Some common criticisms include poor fuel economy, dated interior styling, and handling characteristics that are typical of a large van. The 2008 E-150 came with a few engine options. The 4.2L Essex V6 (200 hp, 260 lb-ft torque), the 4.6L Triton V8 (225 hp, 286 lb-ft torque), and the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft torque) were the available options. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can seize in the cylinder head, leading to thread damage or even plug ejection during removal. This can cause misfires, rough running, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Use anti-seize compound on spark plug threads during installation. Repair damaged threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, the 5.4L engine is known for spark plugs seizing and damaging threads upon removal. Can cause misfires and poor performance.
    *   Solution: Proper torque and anti-seize compound when installing new plugs. Thread repair kit for damaged threads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Phasers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The variable valve timing system (VCT) uses camshaft phasers that can develop issues, leading to a rattling noise, especially at idle. This can also cause poor performance and fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft phasers and related components such as timing chains, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Shifting Problems/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, hard shifts, or slipping between gears can occur due to worn valve body components or internal clutch pack damage.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. Internal damage may require a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid/filter), $500 - $1500 (valve body), $2000 - $4000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front suspension ball joints and control arm bushings are prone to wear, leading to clunking noises, loose steering, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and bushings. Alignment is recommended after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially with heavy use, resulting in a lower ride height and reduced load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider heavy-duty springs for increased load capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, and difficulty starting the vehicle can indicate alternator failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks may fail to operate, requiring manual locking and unlocking.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is a common issue, particularly on the rocker panels and wheel wells, especially in areas with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Remove rust, repair affected areas, and apply rust-resistant coating or paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per area depending on the extent of the damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner material can detach from the backing board, causing it to sag.
    *   Solution: Replace the headliner or re-glue the existing material.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to sun exposure and temperature changes, the dashboard can develop cracks.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or install a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (replacement), $50 - $150 (cover)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2008 Ford E-150 has some common issues, particularly with the engine (spark plug thread failure) and transmission (shifting problems). Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs also show wear over time. Electrical issues like alternator and door lock actuator failures can occur. Rust is a significant concern on the exterior. While some of the repairs are relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission work can be costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs when considering purchasing this van.
