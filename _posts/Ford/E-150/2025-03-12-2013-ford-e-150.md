Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2013 Ford E-150, categorized and detailed as requested. The 2013 Ford E-150 is a full-size van popular for commercial use and passenger transport. It offered two engine options: a 4.6L V8 producing around 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L V8 generating approximately 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the E-150's spacious interior, robust build, and towing capability. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride comfort, and outdated technology.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can seize in the cylinder heads, leading to breakage during removal. This can be caused by corrosion from moisture intrusion over time, as well as extended maintenance intervals. Telltale signs can be misfires, rough idling, and a noticeable decrease in power.
    *   Solution: Use penetrating oil before attempting removal. The engine should be warm, but not hot. Slow and steady is key.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the severity and if a broken spark plug needs to be professionally extracted.
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.4L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L V8, the 5.4L V8 is known for spark plugs seizing in the cylinder heads, often breaking during removal.
    *   Solution: Using penetrating oil, use an impact wrench to remove the spark plugs quickly and reduce the chance of them breaking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+, depending on the severity and if a broken spark plug needs to be professionally extracted.
