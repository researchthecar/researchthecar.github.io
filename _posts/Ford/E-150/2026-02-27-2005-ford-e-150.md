### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford E-150 is a generally durable vehicle, particularly the gasoline V8 engines. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with intake manifold gaskets and spark plug blowouts on the 4.6L and 5.4L V8s. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is known for more significant and costly potential problems, including EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head gasket failures. Transmission issues, particularly with torque converters and internal clutch packs, can arise. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate, and interior components like HVAC blowers and dashboards may require attention. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and reliability of the E-150.
