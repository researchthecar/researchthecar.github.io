The 2004 Ford E-150 is a full-size van known for its durability and utility. Engine options for this year include the 4.2L Essex V6 (200 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), the 4.6L Triton V8 (225 hp, 286 lb-ft of torque), and the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque). All engine options were paired with the 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the E-150 for its ample cargo space, towing capacity, and relatively simple mechanics making it easier to maintain than newer vans. Common complaints center around fuel economy, ride quality, and some specific component failures due to the vehicle's age.

**Engine**

**4.2L Essex V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, coolant leaks (internal or external), overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and a sweet smell of coolant.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A sudden loud popping noise from the engine, followed by a noticeable misfire and loss of power. This is due to the spark plugs stripping the threads in the aluminum cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads in the cylinder head (using a thread repair kit or Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, especially when coming to a stop, and erratic idle speed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A sudden loud popping noise from the engine, followed by a noticeable misfire and loss of power. This is due to the spark plugs stripping the threads in the aluminum cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads in the cylinder head (using a thread repair kit or Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfire, rough running, poor fuel economy, and potentially a check engine light indicating a fuel injector problem.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (per injector, depending on labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay when shifting between gears (especially from Park or Reverse to Drive), harsh or jerky shifts, and slipping.
    *   Solution: Often caused by low transmission fluid, contaminated fluid, or valve body issues. A fluid flush and filter change might help, but a valve body rebuild or transmission replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter) - $3000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds (especially under light acceleration), stalling when coming to a stop, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints and/or bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sagging Leaf Springs (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the van sitting lower than normal, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a rough ride.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs or adding helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, slow engine cranking, a warning light on the dashboard (battery or alternator), and eventually the engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks failing to lock or unlock, or only working intermittently.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Ford E-150, while a reliable workhorse, does have some common issues. Engine problems like spark plug blowout on the 4.6L and 5.4L Triton V8s, and intake manifold gasket failures on the 4.2L V6 can be expensive to fix. The 4R70W transmission can also experience problems with shifting and the torque converter. Suspension issues like worn ball joints and sagging leaf springs are typical for a vehicle of this age. Rust is also a concern, especially in areas prone to salt. Overall, while the E-150 is a capable van, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs. The severity and cost of these issues varies, but some repairs can be quite expensive.
