Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2012 Ford E-150, formatted as requested.

The 2012 Ford E-150 is a full-size cargo and passenger van known for its practicality and spaciousness. This year, the E-150 came standard with a 4.6L Triton V8 engine producing 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque. An optional 5.4L Triton V8 engine offered 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the van's robust build and ample cargo capacity. However, some common complaints include its relatively poor fuel economy and dated interior design compared to more modern vans.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can seize in the cylinder head, causing the threads to strip upon removal or ejection of the spark plug, often accompanied by a loud popping noise and engine misfire.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads using a thread insert kit (like Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on repair method and shop labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfire, rough idling, check engine light illuminated.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty coil pack(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on how many need replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford E-150, while a dependable work van, is prone to certain issues related to its age and design. The Triton V8 engines, while durable, have a history of spark plug thread issues. The 4-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting problems and torque converter failure. Suspension wear is also common. Electrical issues, particularly with blend door actuators and power windows, also surface. Body rust is a concern in certain climates. The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (e.g., blend door actuator) to potentially costly (e.g., transmission rebuild or engine work).
