### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford E-150 is a capable work van with a generally solid reputation, but it's not without its common issues. The gasoline V6 and V8 engines can experience intake manifold gasket leaks and spark plug blowouts, while the automatic transmissions, particularly the 4R70W, may develop torque converter or clutch pack problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also noted for wear. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and window regulator problems are not uncommon. Rust can be a concern on exterior body panels, especially in certain climates. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor is a component that may require replacement. Despite these potential issues, many E-150s continue to serve reliably with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
