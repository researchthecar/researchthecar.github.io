Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2007 Ford E-150, formatted for your website. This van is popular for its spaciousness, versatility, and towing capacity. However, owners often cite issues with fuel economy and the vehicle's overall age-related maintenance needs. The 2007 Ford E-150 offered three engine options: a 4.2L Essex V6 (201 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.6L Triton V8 (225 hp and 286 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as the other engines, spark plugs can eject due to weak threads in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head. Thread repair kits can be used in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues (though less common than in later 5.4L engines)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine ticking or rattling noise, especially at idle or low speeds. Can also lead to rough running and poor performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam phasers and possibly other related components like timing chains and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Exhaust Manifold Studs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leak noise, especially on cold starts. Can lead to reduced fuel economy and performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold studs. This can be a difficult and time-consuming repair, especially if the studs are seized.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R70W/4R75E)**

*   **Shifting Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or failure to shift.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford E-150 is a reliable van, but owners should be aware of common issues, particularly those related to the engine (spark plug blowout, cam phasers on the 5.4L), the transmission (shifting problems), and age-related wear and tear of suspension components. Electrical issues like alternator failure and battery drain are also potential concerns. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, with engine and transmission work potentially being the most expensive. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify any existing or potential problems. Rust is a major concern depending on location and environment that the vehicle has been exposed to.
