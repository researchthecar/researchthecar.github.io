Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2010 Ford E-150, categorized by major component. The 2010 Ford E-150 is a popular cargo and passenger van known for its reliability and practicality. It was offered with two engine options: a 4.6L Triton V8 producing around 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L Triton V8 producing around 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People appreciate the E-150 for its spacious interior, payload capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design. Common dislikes include fuel economy and some reported reliability issues related to certain components as detailed below.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The aluminum cylinder heads are prone to spark plug thread damage, particularly when removing or installing spark plugs. This can lead to spark plugs being ejected from the cylinder head, causing engine misfires and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repairing the damaged threads using thread inserts (e.g., Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may occur from various areas, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gaskets, and front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, the 5.4L engine also suffers from spark plug thread damage.
    *   Solution: Same as 4.6L - Repairing the damaged threads using thread inserts or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+, depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Phasers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is less common than in later versions of the 5.4, but it can still happen. The camshaft phasers can fail, leading to rough idling, engine ticking noise (especially on startup), and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft phasers and possibly related components like timing chains and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks may occur from various areas, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gaskets, and front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (4R75E/W)**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission may exhibit erratic shifting patterns, slipping between gears, or delayed engagement. This can be caused by worn valve body components, solenoid failures, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing faulty components within the transmission (e.g., valve body, solenoids) or overhauling/replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+, depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive wear in the front suspension ball joints can lead to clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, reducing load-carrying capacity and ride height. In extreme cases, the leaf springs can break.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per side, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the door lock actuators, making it difficult to lock or unlock doors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning blend door actuators can cause issues with climate control, resulting in inconsistent temperature or airflow from the vents.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+, depending on location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power window motors, making it difficult to roll the windows up or down.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (especially around wheel wells and lower body panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation is a common issue on older vehicles, particularly in areas exposed to road salt and moisture.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing rusted panels, applying rust inhibitors, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+, depending on the extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner may start to sag or detach from the roof, particularly in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: Replacing or repairing the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+.

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford E-150 is generally considered a reliable van, but it's not without its potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the engines, particularly the potential for spark plug thread damage, and oil leaks. Camshaft phaser issues are also possible on the 5.4L engine. The transmission can experience shifting problems. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out over time. Electrical issues related to door locks and blend door actuators are also relatively common. Rust can be a problem, especially in regions with harsh winters. While some of these issues can be relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others, such as engine and transmission problems, can be more costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect any used E-150 for these common issues before making a purchase.
