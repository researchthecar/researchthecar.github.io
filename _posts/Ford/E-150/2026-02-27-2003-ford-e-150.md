### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford E-150 is generally a reliable vehicle, especially its core powertrain components. The V6 and V8 engines, while having some specific known issues like intake manifold leaks and spark plug problems (particularly on the 5.4L), are robust when maintained. Automatic transmissions, such as the 4R70W and 4R75W, can experience torque converter or solenoid issues, but these are often repairable. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are typical wear items for a vehicle of this type and age. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure and instrument cluster problems, are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate and maintenance. Overall, the E-150 offers good value for its utility, but potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas.
