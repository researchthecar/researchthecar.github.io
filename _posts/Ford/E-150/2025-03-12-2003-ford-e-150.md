The 2003 Ford E-150 is a full-size van popular for both commercial and personal use, known for its spacious interior, payload capacity, and relatively simple mechanics. The 2003 E-150 came with a range of engine options: the 4.2L Essex V6 (200 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque), the 4.6L Triton V8 (225 hp and 286 lb-ft of torque), and the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Common praises for the E-150 include its reliability and practicality, while criticisms often revolve around fuel economy and handling characteristics compared to modern vans. Owners often enjoy the van's adaptability for work or camping, while others find its size cumbersome for daily driving.

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford E-150, while a reliable workhorse, suffers from some common issues, particularly with the Triton engines (spark plug blowout and oil leaks) and the 4-speed automatic transmission. Suspension components also tend to wear out, as well as minor electrical and interior issues. The severity and cost of these problems range from relatively inexpensive repairs like replacing valve cover gaskets to more costly fixes such as cylinder head repair or transmission rebuilds. Rust is also a common concern, especially in regions with harsh winters.
