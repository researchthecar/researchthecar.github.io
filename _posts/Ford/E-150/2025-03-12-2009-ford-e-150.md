The 2009 Ford E-150 is a full-size van, popular for its utility and versatility as a work vehicle or for conversion into a camper van. It offered three engine choices: a 4.2L Essex V6 producing 201 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 4.6L Triton V8 making 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L Triton V8 generating 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the E-150 for its dependability, spaciousness, and towing capability. Common complaints include fuel economy, ride quality, and certain model-year-specific issues.

**Engine**

**4.2L Essex V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The spark plug threads in the aluminum cylinder heads are prone to stripping, especially during spark plug changes. This results in misfires and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Repair the spark plug threads using thread repair inserts like Time-Sert or Helicoil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the shop and number of cylinders needing repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, the 5.4L Triton V8 also suffers from spark plug thread stripping issues in the aluminum cylinder heads. This leads to misfires and engine performance issues.
    *   Solution: Repair the spark plug threads using thread repair inserts like Time-Sert or Helicoil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the shop and number of cylinders needing repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Camshaft Phaser Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The variable valve timing (VVT) system uses camshaft phasers, which can wear out or fail. Symptoms include a rattling noise at startup, rough idling, and decreased engine power.
    *   Solution: Replace the camshaft phasers, timing chains, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R70W/4R75E)**

*   **Shift Flare/Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission may exhibit slipping between gears (shift flare) or harsh/jerky shifts. This can be caused by worn valve body components or internal friction plates.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild. In severe cases, a full transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3500+, depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. Can also lead to transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Often recommended to flush the transmission and replace the filter as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front suspension ball joints are prone to wear, especially with heavy use or load carrying. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front end, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. Often recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially if the van is frequently used for carrying heavy loads or towing. This results in a lower ride height in the rear, reduced load capacity, and potentially poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the van is regularly used for heavy work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks may fail to operate consistently, or not at all. Often, one or more door lock actuators will fail.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the lower body panels, especially around the wheel wells and rocker panels. This is more common in areas with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Repair the rust by cutting out the affected areas, welding in new metal, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford E-150, while a capable and versatile van, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine-related problems, particularly spark plug thread issues in the 4.6L and 5.4L V8 engines, and camshaft phaser problems in the 5.4L V8, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues such as shift flare and torque converter failure are also potential concerns. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and leaf springs, are prone to wear and may need replacement. Electrical issues, like door lock actuator failures, can be irritating. Rust is a consideration in some environments. Overall, the severity and cost of these issues range from relatively minor electrical fixes to more significant engine and transmission repairs, making a thorough pre-purchase inspection advisable.
