The 2006 Ford Freestar minivan offered a comfortable ride and spacious interior, making it a popular choice for families. However, like any vehicle, it had its share of issues. The Freestar came standard with a 3.9L V6 engine producing 193 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque.

Owners often praised the Freestar's smooth ride and ample cargo space, but common complaints included concerns about reliability, particularly regarding the transmission and some electrical components.
