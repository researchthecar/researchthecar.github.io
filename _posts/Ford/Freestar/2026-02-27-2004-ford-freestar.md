### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford Freestar exhibits common issues for its age and class, particularly concerning its powertrain and suspension components. Engine problems like intake manifold leaks and spark plug blowout are notable, as are transmission issues such as torque converter failure. Suspension wear, electrical gremlins related to the BCM and alternator, and exterior corrosion are also frequently reported. While not inherently unreliable, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential repair costs and prioritize vehicles with well-maintained histories. Regular inspections and addressing minor issues promptly can help mitigate more significant problems.
