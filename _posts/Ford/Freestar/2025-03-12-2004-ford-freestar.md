The 2004 Ford Freestar was Ford's attempt to compete in the minivan market, offering a spacious interior and relatively comfortable ride. The 2004 Freestar was available with two engine options: a 3.9L V6 producing 193 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque and a 4.2L V6 producing 201 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
