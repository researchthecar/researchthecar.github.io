The truck was praised for its durability, towing capacity, and off-road capabilities. However, some owners have reported experiencing some issues with the vehicle.

**Engine**

**460ci V8**
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, leading to coolant and/or oil leaks. Symptoms include coolant loss, overheating, and a rough idle. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Exhaust manifold cracking:** The exhaust manifold can crack, causing exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a loud exhaust noise and reduced engine performance. The solution is to replace the exhaust manifold. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Distributor failure:** The distributor can fail, causing ignition problems. Symptoms include difficulty starting, engine misfiring, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the distributor. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**7.3L V8 Diesel**
* **Injector failure:** The fuel injectors can fail, causing engine misfiring, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust. The solution is to replace the failed injector(s). *Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per injector
* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail, resulting in reduced boost pressure and loss of power. Symptoms include a lack of acceleration, excessive smoke, and a whistling or grinding noise from the turbocharger. The solution is to replace the turbocharger. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Fuel pump failure:** The fuel pump can fail, preventing fuel from reaching the engine. Symptoms include difficulty starting, engine stalling, and loss of power. The solution is to replace the fuel pump. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+

**Transmission**

**E4OD Automatic Transmission**
* **Overdrive failure:** The overdrive unit can fail, causing the transmission to slip out of gear. Symptoms include a loss of power when accelerating, and a clunking noise from the transmission. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Valve body failure:** The valve body can fail, causing shifting problems. Symptoms include delayed or harsh shifts, and slipping gears. The solution is to replace the valve body. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Solenoid failure:** The solenoids can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not at all. Symptoms include harsh or delayed shifts, and no movement. The solution is to replace the failed solenoid(s). *Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+

**NV4500 Manual Transmission**
* **Synchronizer failure:** The synchronizers can wear out, making it difficult or impossible to shift gears. Symptoms include grinding noises when shifting, and difficulty engaging gears. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out, causing slipping and difficulty engaging gears. Symptoms include a burning smell, difficulty shifting gears, and vibration when driving. The solution is to replace the clutch. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
* **Driveline vibration:** The driveline can become unbalanced, causing vibrations. Symptoms include shaking or humming noises while driving, particularly at high speeds. The solution is to balance the driveline. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+

**Suspension**

* **Leaf spring failure:** The leaf springs can fail, causing the truck to sag and ride rough. Symptoms include a sagging rear end, reduced ride height, and a rough ride. The solution is to replace the leaf springs. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per side
* **Shock absorber failure:** The shock absorbers can fail, reducing ride quality and handling. Symptoms include a rough ride, excessive bouncing, and poor cornering. The solution is to replace the shock absorbers. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ per shock
* **Ball joint failure:** The ball joints can wear out, causing the suspension to become loose and unstable. Symptoms include a clunking or rattling noise when driving over bumps, and uneven tire wear. The solution is to replace the ball joints. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per side

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, preventing the battery from charging. Symptoms include dim headlights, difficulty starting the engine, and warning lights on the dashboard. The solution is to replace the alternator. *Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
