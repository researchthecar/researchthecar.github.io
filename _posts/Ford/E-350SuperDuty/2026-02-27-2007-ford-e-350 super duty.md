### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while generally a durable vehicle, exhibits some common issues, particularly with its powertrain options. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is known for potential EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head gasket failures, which can be costly to repair. The gasoline V8 and V10 engines can suffer from spark plug blowout and camshaft position sensor issues. Transmission reliability is generally good, but torque converter and solenoid issues can arise. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, as expected for a heavy-duty vehicle. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and instrument cluster problems are also reported. Overall, the E-350 is a capable work van, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability concerns, especially when considering models with the 6.0L diesel engine.
