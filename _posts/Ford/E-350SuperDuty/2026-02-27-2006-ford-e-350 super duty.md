### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a capable commercial vehicle, but its reliability can be significantly influenced by the specific engine and transmission chosen, as well as its service history and operating conditions. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is known for potential costly issues like EGR and oil cooler failures, and head gasket problems, making it a higher-risk option. The gasoline V8 and V10 engines are generally more straightforward but can suffer from spark plug ejection. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic units, can arise from torque converter or internal component wear. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, especially under load. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. Overall, while the E-350 is built tough, owners should be aware of these potential problem areas and factor in maintenance and repair costs, especially for the 6.0L diesel.
