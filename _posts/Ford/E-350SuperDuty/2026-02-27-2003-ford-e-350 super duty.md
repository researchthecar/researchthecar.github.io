### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while a capable and durable vehicle, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and heavy-duty nature. The gasoline Triton V8 engines (5.4L and 6.8L) are susceptible to spark plug blowout and camshaft synchronizer problems. The diesel 7.3L Power Stroke can experience injector O-ring leaks. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4R100, may require attention for overheating and solenoid issues. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are also noted for wear. Electrical systems can be affected by alternator failures and wiring corrosion. Exterior rust is a significant concern in certain climates. Interior issues are less common, with HVAC blend door actuators being a notable point of failure. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing these known issues, the E-350 can remain a reliable work vehicle.
