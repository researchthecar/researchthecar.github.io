**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can break upon removal due to their two-piece design. This design was used in the 2004-2008 model years.
    *   Solution: Special tools are needed to extract the broken spark plug pieces. Use anti-seize compound on the new plugs upon installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the number of broken plugs and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold studs can break, leading to exhaust leaks. This results in a ticking noise, especially upon cold start.
    *   Solution: Broken studs need to be extracted, and new studs and gaskets should be installed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+, depending on the number of broken studs and ease of access.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, exhaust manifold studs can break, causing exhaust leaks and a ticking noise, primarily noticeable during cold starts.
    *   Solution: Broken studs need to be extracted, and new studs and gaskets installed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+, depending on the number of broken studs and ease of access.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler failure leads to coolant entering the engine, causing white smoke, coolant loss, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an updated design. Bulletproofing the EGR is also a popular option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+, depending on the parts used and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil cooler can become clogged, restricting oil flow and leading to overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler. Consider relocating the oil cooler to a location that is easier to access for maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+, including parts and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Injector stiction caused by sulfur deposits. This is typically caused by extended oil change intervals and improper oil type. Symptoms include hard starts, rough idle, and poor performance.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors and perform an oil change using high-quality oil that meets Ford's specifications.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800 per injector to replace
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R75W 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by a worn valve body, failing solenoids, or low fluid level. A fluid flush, valve body replacement, or solenoid replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) to $1500+ (valve body or solenoid replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure results in shuddering, slipping, and potential transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+.
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping, and harsh engagement can be caused by worn or sticking valves within the valve body.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1800+ depending on labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially in vehicles frequently used for heavy hauling. This results in a lower ride height and reduced load capacity.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with new or heavy-duty options. Adding helper springs or air bags can also provide additional support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ for leaf spring replacement, $200 - $800+ for helper springs or air bags.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while a capable and versatile vehicle, is prone to certain issues. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine tends to have the most significant (and costly) problems due to EGR cooler, oil cooler, and injector failures. The gas engines are more reliable, but can still suffer from spark plug issues and manifold leaks. Suspension and electrical issues are common across all models. Rust is a concern in certain climates. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission repairs. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, especially the diesel engine, and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
