The 2008 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a full-size van renowned for its ruggedness and utility. It's a popular choice for commercial use, conversions (like shuttle buses or campers), and hauling heavy loads. Owners appreciate its robust construction, ample cargo space, and towing capacity. However, some dislike its fuel economy, cumbersome handling, and relatively basic interior compared to modern vehicles. Engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (305 hp, 420 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (325 hp, 570 lb-ft of torque). A 4-speed automatic transmission was standard.
