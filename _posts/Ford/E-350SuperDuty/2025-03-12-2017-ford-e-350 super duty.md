The 2017 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a robust workhorse van designed for hauling cargo and passengers. It was offered with two primary engine choices: the 5.4L Triton V8 and the 6.8L Triton V10. The 5.4L V8 produces 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, offering adequate power for most hauling needs. The 6.8L V10 ramps things up to 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque, providing significantly more grunt for heavy-duty tasks. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the E-350's reliability, spacious interior, and payload capacity. However, some dislike its dated design, fuel economy, and ride quality compared to newer vans.
