Common dislikes include the relatively dated design, fuel economy, and ride quality compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The spark plug threads in the cylinder head are prone to stripping or ejecting spark plugs, leading to misfires, rough running, and potential damage to the cylinder head. A ticking noise may also be present.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with thread repair kits (e.g., Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head are the common solutions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the repair method and if the cylinder head needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Phaser Issues (Infrequent, but possible carryover from earlier years)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise, especially at start-up, along with rough running and decreased performance. This is more common in earlier 5.4L Tritons, but possible on a 2016 E-350 with higher mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft phasers, timing chains, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud ticking or hissing noise, especially during cold starts. Reduced fuel economy and potential exhaust fumes entering the cabin. Broken manifold bolts.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold(s) and broken studs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ per manifold.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The spark plug threads in the cylinder head are prone to stripping or ejecting spark plugs, leading to misfires, rough running, and potential damage to the cylinder head. A ticking noise may also be present.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with thread repair kits (e.g., Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head are the common solutions.

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, vibrations, or slipping during acceleration. Trouble shifting gears, especially at higher speeds. Transmission overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. It is often recommended to flush the transmission, replace the filter, and inspect the transmission for further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hard or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifts, delayed engagement, or inability to shift into certain gears. This can be caused by a worn or faulty valve body, solenoids, or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body, replacing faulty solenoids, or overhauling the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3500+ depending on the severity and extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sags, especially when loaded. Reduced ride height and compromised handling. Visible cracks or breakage in the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Consider heavy-duty or upgraded leaf springs if the van is consistently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose or wandering steering. Clunking noises when going over bumps. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side, depending on which components need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while a capable and durable work van, has its share of potential issues. The most common problems revolve around the engine (spark plug thread failure and exhaust manifold leaks), transmission (torque converter issues), suspension (leaf spring problems), and electrical system (alternator failures). The severity of these issues ranges from relatively minor (door lock actuators) to potentially costly (engine or transmission rebuilds).  The cost to repair these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage. Prospective buyers should be aware of these common issues and have any potential vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase.
