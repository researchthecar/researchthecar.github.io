* **No Issues Found**

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8**
* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible smoke from the exhaust, and a noticeable drop in oil level on the dipstick.
    * Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and consult a mechanic for diagnosis. Potential fixes include replacing valve seals, piston rings, or addressing other internal engine issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and required repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**
* **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunctions related to the DEF system, including sensor failures, DEF pump failures, and clogged DEF injectors. This can lead to warning lights, reduced engine power, and potential limp mode.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific component failure using a diagnostic scan tool. Replace the faulty sensor, pump, or injector as needed. Ensure proper DEF fluid quality.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the part and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engine Options)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. This may be accompanied by a noticeable clunking noise during gear changes.
    * Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid change may resolve minor issues. More serious cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noises emanating from the rear leaf springs, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    * Solution: Lubricate the leaf spring bushings and contact points. If the squeaking persists, the bushings may be worn and require replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (lubrication) - $500+ (bushing replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

    * Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may freeze, become unresponsive, or experience intermittent connectivity problems with Bluetooth devices or smartphone integration features like Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.
    * Solution: Try a system reboot. Check for software updates and install them if available. If the problem persists, a dealer visit for diagnostics and potential module replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reboot/update) - $500+ (module replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, especially when the vehicle is not driven regularly. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine or a completely dead battery.
    * Solution: Have the battery tested and replaced if necessary. Check for parasitic draws by having the electrical system diagnosed.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (recharge) - $1,000+ (component replacement).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford E-350 Super Duty appears to have relatively few widespread, severe issues based on available information. The most concerning problems seem to center around potential engine issues like excessive oil consumption with the 7.3L Godzilla V8 and DEF system problems with the diesel engine. The transmission can exhibit harsh shifting. Other issues are related to electrics (infotainment and battery), suspension (leaf spring noise), exterior (side mirrors) and interior (AC). Repair costs can vary widely depending on the issue, ranging from relatively minor fixes to more expensive engine or transmission repairs. Pre-purchase inspections and diligent maintenance are crucial for mitigating potential problems.
