The 2004 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a full-size van popular for commercial use, conversions, and hauling. Available engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel (early 2004 models only), and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel (late 2004 models). The 5.4L V8 produced around 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the E-350's robust build, spacious interior, and towing capacity. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the larger engines), ride quality (inherent to a heavy-duty van), and some specific mechanical issues detailed below. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The aluminum cylinder head threads are prone to stripping, causing spark plugs to eject from the head, resulting in a loud popping noise, misfire, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repair the threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert, Heli-Coil) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the repair method and if head replacement is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold studs commonly break, resulting in an exhaust leak. Symptoms are a ticking noise, especially when cold, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace broken exhaust manifold studs and gaskets. Sometimes the manifold itself is warped and needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L V8, the 6.8L V10 also suffers from spark plug thread stripping in the aluminum cylinder heads, leading to spark plug ejection, misfires, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repair the threads with a thread repair kit or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on repair method and head replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold studs commonly break, resulting in an exhaust leak. Symptoms are a ticking noise, especially when cold, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace broken exhaust manifold studs and gaskets. Sometimes the manifold itself is warped and needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel (Early 2004)**

*   **Cam Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic engine performance, stalling, or no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke on startup. Glow plugs may burn out or the glow plug relay may fail.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty glow plugs and/or the glow plug relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on how many glow plugs need replacing and the relay)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel (Late 2004)**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, potential for cylinder head damage. The EGR cooler is prone to cracking and leaking.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler, potentially requiring head gasket replacement if the engine overheated.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on related damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, excessive black smoke, and reduced power. The 6.0L Power Stroke is known for injector issues.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on how many injectors need replacing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Lack of power, excessive black smoke, whistling noise from the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the turbocharger. Common issues include sticking vanes and bearing failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 (All Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at low speeds, slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the van sitting lower than normal, poor ride quality, reduced load-carrying capacity. The leaf springs are prone to sagging, especially with heavy use.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the van is frequently used for hauling or towing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front-end noise (clunking or squeaking), loose steering, uneven tire wear.

**Summary**

The 2004 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while a capable and versatile van, has several known issues. Engine problems, especially spark plug blowout and manifold leaks (for the gasoline engines) and EGR cooler/injector failures (for the 6.0L diesel), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, while less frequent, can also lead to significant expenses. Suspension and electrical problems are also common and can contribute to overall maintenance costs. The severity and cost of these issues vary depending on the engine, mileage, and how well the vehicle was maintained. Buyers should carefully inspect any used E-350 Super Duty and be prepared for potential repairs.
