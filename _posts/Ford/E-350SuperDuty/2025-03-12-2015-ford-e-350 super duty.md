The 2015 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, offering ample cargo and passenger space. It was available with either a 5.4L Triton V8 engine producing 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque or a 6.8L Triton V10 engine producing 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the E-350's robust build, payload capacity, and reliability for work purposes. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride comfort, and the van's size, making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs are prone to seizing in the cylinder heads and breaking during removal, often requiring specialized tools and techniques to extract the broken pieces. This is exacerbated by the engine's aluminum cylinder heads.
    *   Solution: Using penetrating oil before attempting removal, and employing a specialized spark plug extraction tool if breakage occurs. Anti-seize compound should be applied to the new spark plug threads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of plugs broken and the need for professional extraction).
    *   Recalls: None Found
