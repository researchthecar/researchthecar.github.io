The 2010 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a full-size van known for its workhorse capabilities, spacious interior, and reliability. Engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.8L Triton V10 (305 hp, 420 lb-ft of torque). The 5.4L V8 was designed for those needing a balance of power and efficiency, while the 6.8L V10 delivered robust performance for heavier payloads and towing. A 4-speed automatic transmission was the only transmission available. Common praises include its ample cargo space and dependability, while owners sometimes complain about fuel economy and handling compared to more modern vans.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton engine is known for ejecting spark plugs due to weak aluminum cylinder head threads. This results in a loud popping noise, misfires, and a noticeable loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repairing the spark plug threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or similar) is a common fix. This involves installing a steel insert into the cylinder head to provide stronger threads for the spark plug.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the number of cylinders needing repair and shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While less common than in other Ford vehicles with this engine, the cam phasers can still experience wear and cause rough idling, engine knocking, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chain, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold studs are prone to breaking, leading to exhaust leaks. This results in a ticking noise, especially on cold starts, and a reduction in fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken studs and possibly the exhaust manifold if it is warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+ depending on the number of broken studs and the need to replace the manifold.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, the 6.8L can also experience spark plug ejection due to weak threads.
    *   Solution: Thread repair using a Time-Sert or similar kit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the number of cylinders needing repair and shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R75E)**

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4R75E transmission can experience shift flare (high RPMs between shifts) and slipping, particularly when shifting from 2nd to 3rd gear. This is often due to worn clutch packs or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: A transmission rebuild or replacement is often necessary. Addressing valve body issues can sometimes resolve the problem if caught early.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ for a rebuild or replacement; $500 - $1500 for valve body repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs are prone to sagging, especially when the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads. This results in a lower ride height, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potentially compromised handling. Cracking can also occur with age.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear leaf springs. Upgrading to heavy-duty springs can be beneficial for vehicles regularly used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the quality of the replacement springs and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Alternator failures are common as the vehicle ages. Symptoms include a dead battery, dimming headlights, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The wiring harness that runs into the doors can fatigue and break due to constant opening and closing. This can cause issues with power windows, door locks, and speakers.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the door wiring harness. This may involve splicing in new wires or replacing the entire harness section.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues (Body and Frame)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, particularly in areas prone to salt exposure (e.g., undercarriage, wheel wells, rocker panels), is a common concern.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, which may involve welding in new metal panels or applying rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning blend door actuators can result in inconsistent or incorrect temperature control in the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while a reliable work van, can suffer from engine issues like spark plug thread failures, especially in the 5.4L V8 and 6.8L V10 engines. The transmission can also experience issues with slipping and shifting. The suspension can also be costly to repair. Electrical faults like alternator failure can also be an issue. The most severe issues can be costly, with engine and transmission repairs potentially costing several thousand dollars. Rust is a major concern, especially in regions with harsh winters.
