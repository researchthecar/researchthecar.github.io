The 2019 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, known for its robust chassis, payload capacity, and versatility. Engine options include the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine producing 288 horsepower and 424 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 gasoline engine producing 316 horsepower and 397 lb-ft of torque. The 6.8L V10 is generally well-regarded for its power and reliability in heavy-duty applications. A common point of dislike is the fuel economy due to the van's weight and size. Owners often appreciate the van's spaciousness and its ability to be customized for various business needs.
