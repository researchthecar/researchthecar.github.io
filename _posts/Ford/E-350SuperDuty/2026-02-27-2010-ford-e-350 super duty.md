### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a workhorse vehicle that generally holds up well under demanding conditions. The most common issues tend to be related to the powertrain, particularly spark plug ejection on the Triton V8 engines and potential EGR/oil cooler problems on the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel. Transmission issues, while not universal, can arise with higher mileage, often involving the torque converter or solenoid packs. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the vehicle's load-carrying nature. Electrical and interior components are generally less problematic, with occasional failures of items like alternators or blower motors. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are key to maintaining the reliability of this capable van.
