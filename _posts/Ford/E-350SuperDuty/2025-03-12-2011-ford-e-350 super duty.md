The 2011 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a full-size van known for its durability and utility, primarily used for commercial purposes like cargo hauling, passenger transport, and service vehicles. Engine options for this year included a 5.4L Triton V8, a 6.8L Triton V10, and a 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 5.4L V8 produces around 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission available was a 4-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the van's robust build and ample cargo space, but some common complaints revolve around its relatively poor fuel economy, somewhat outdated interior, and potential maintenance costs associated with a heavy-duty vehicle of this age.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can become loose or eject from the cylinder head due to weak threads in the aluminum cylinder head. This leads to misfires, rough running, and loud popping noises.
    *   Solution: Repair the threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on repair method and shop rates).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The variable valve timing (VVT) system utilizes cam phasers that can wear out or fail. This leads to a rattling noise at idle or low RPMs, rough running, reduced power, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam phasers, timing chain, guides, and possibly the VCT solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifolds on the V10 engine can crack or warp over time, leading to exhaust leaks. This creates a ticking or hissing noise, especially upon cold starts, and can decrease fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) cooler is prone to cracking and leaking coolant into the exhaust system. This can cause white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and potentially lead to head gasket failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an updated design. Consider a bulletproof EGR cooler for increased reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors can fail due to contamination or wear. This can lead to rough running, misfires, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector (labor included).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R75E)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid. Inspect the transmission for any damage from debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn clutch packs or valve body issues can lead to slipping between gears or harsh/delayed shifting.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service (fluid and filter change). If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be needed, potentially leading to a valve body rebuild or transmission overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for service, $500 - $1,500+ for valve body, $2,000 - $4,000+ for overhaul/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs can sag over time, especially with heavy loads, leading to a lower ride height and reduced load-carrying capacity. Cracking can also occur.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider heavy-duty springs if the vehicle is regularly used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front-end components such as ball joints and tie rod ends can wear out, leading to loose steering, vibrations, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends. An alignment is required after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail, leading to a dead battery, dimming lights, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks may fail to function properly. Either it will lock, but not unlock, or it will unlock, but not lock. Sometimes the door lock will not function at all.
    *   Solution: Replace the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Arches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust develops on the lower body panels such as the rocker panels and wheel arches. This rust can eventually eat away at the metal and create holes.
    *   Solution: Cut out the rust, weld in new metal, and repaint the area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner adhesive can fail, causing the headliner material to sag or detach from the backing board.
    *   Solution: Replace the headliner material and adhesive or replace the entire headliner assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while generally a reliable workhorse, has several common issues to be aware of. Engine problems, particularly spark plug thread failure on the 5.4L and EGR cooler issues on the 6.0L diesel, can be costly to address. Transmission issues, such as torque converter failure, are also prevalent. Suspension wear and rust on the exterior are typical for a vehicle of this age. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic, paying close attention to these areas.
