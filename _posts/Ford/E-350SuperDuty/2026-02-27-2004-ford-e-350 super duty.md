### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford E-350 Super Duty, particularly with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, is known to have several significant potential reliability issues that can be costly to repair. The diesel engine requires diligent maintenance and awareness of common failure points like the EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head studs. Gasoline V8 and V10 engines are generally more straightforward but can suffer from spark plug ejection and sensor issues. Transmission reliability is decent, but older units may require attention to torque converters and solenoids. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical gremlins and rust are also common concerns for vehicles of this age. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and timely repairs, the E-350 can remain a capable and dependable vehicle for its intended purpose.
