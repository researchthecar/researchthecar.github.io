The 2012 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a full-size van primarily used for commercial purposes, such as cargo hauling and passenger transport. It was offered with two engine options: a 5.4L Triton V8 and a 6.8L Triton V10. The 5.4L V8 produces around 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. The 6.8L V10 engine produces around 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the E-350's workhorse capabilities, spacious interior, and robust build. Common complaints include the van's relatively poor fuel economy, outdated interior design, and handling characteristics compared to more modern vans.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton engine is known for spark plugs breaking during removal. The two-piece spark plug design can separate, leaving the lower portion of the plug stuck in the cylinder head. This can lead to misfires and rough running if the plugs aren't changed.
    *   Solution: Specialized tools are required to extract the broken spark plugs. A common approach is to use a Lisle tool to remove the broken plug pieces. It's important to use anti-seize compound on the new spark plugs to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the number of broken plugs and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold bolts on the 5.4L Triton engine are prone to breaking, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking noise, especially upon cold start, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Broken bolts need to be extracted, and new bolts and gaskets installed. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may be warped or cracked and require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ depending on the number of bolts and the condition of the manifold.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold leaks are common on the 6.8L Triton V10 engine. Symptoms include a ticking noise that gets louder as the engine warms up, as well as reduced fuel economy.
    * Solution: Repair or replace exhaust manifold and/or gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ depending on the severity of the issue and location
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **4R75E 4-Speed Automatic**
    *   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report issues with the 4R75E transmission exhibiting delayed or harsh shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. This can also manifest as slipping during gear changes.
        *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter replacement might help in minor cases. More severe issues may require valve body repair or replacement, or even a full transmission rebuild. Check solenoids, valve body, and inspect the transmission for internal damage.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) to $2,500+ (rebuild).
        *   Recalls: None Found

    *   **Torque Converter Failure**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause shuddering, stalling, and poor acceleration.
        *   Solution: Torque converter replacement is necessary. The transmission should be inspected for contamination from the failing torque converter, and a fluid flush performed.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
        *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs on the E-350 are prone to sagging, especially if the van is frequently used for heavy loads. This can lead to a reduced ride height, poor handling, and bottoming out.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with new or upgraded units is the solution. Adding helper springs or air suspension can also provide additional support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the type of springs and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front ball joints are subject to wear, resulting in clunking noises, wandering steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints. It's generally recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints on both sides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Alternator failure can result in a dead battery, dimming lights, and other electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator. Ensure the battery is also tested to confirm its health.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door lock actuators can fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking electronically.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on body panels, especially around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and door seams, particularly in regions with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involves removing the rust, patching the affected area (if necessary), and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and location of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner material can separate from the backing board, causing it to sag.
    *   Solution: Replace or re-glue the headliner. Replacement is usually the more durable option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while a capable work van, has some common issues. Engine issues, such as spark plug and exhaust manifold problems, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues can range from fluid flushes to full rebuilds, with corresponding cost variations. Suspension issues like sagging leaf springs are prevalent, especially in vehicles that have been heavily loaded. Electrical gremlins such as alternator and door lock actuator failures can also occur. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, others may require more extensive and costly repairs. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and thoroughly inspect any used E-350 before purchase.
