### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while generally a durable vehicle, exhibits some common issues across its powertrain and other systems. The Triton V8 and V10 engines are prone to spark plug blowout and intake manifold leaks, while the diesel 7.3L Power Stroke can suffer from injector O-ring issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4R70W and E4OD/4R100, can experience torque converter or solenoid problems and are susceptible to overheating. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints may require attention due to heavy use. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and wiring corrosion are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern, and interior HVAC components like the blower motor are common failure points. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and timely repairs, the E-350 Super Duty can remain a reliable work vehicle.
