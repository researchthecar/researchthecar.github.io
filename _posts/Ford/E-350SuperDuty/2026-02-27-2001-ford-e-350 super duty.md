### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford E-350 Super Duty generally offers good reliability, particularly the robust 7.3L Power Stroke diesel engine. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as spark plug blowout on the gasoline V8 and V10 engines, and common wear items like ball joints and leaf springs. Transmission issues, especially with the 4R100, can arise, often related to torque converter clutch operation or overheating.
