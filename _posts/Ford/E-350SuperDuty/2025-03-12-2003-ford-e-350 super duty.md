The 2003 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a full-size van known for its robust build and practicality, often used for commercial purposes or as a conversion van. Available engine options include the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp, 425 lb-ft of torque), and the 7.3L Power Stroke Diesel V8 (275 hp, 525 lb-ft of torque). A primary dislike is its age, leading to higher maintenance needs, as well as fuel economy and handling. Owners often appreciate the vehicle's reliability, cargo capacity, and towing capability. All engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 engine in the 2003 E-350 Super Duty is known for spark plug thread failures in the cylinder heads. Spark plugs can eject from the head, causing a loud popping noise, misfires, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repair involves either installing thread inserts (like Time-Serts or Heli-Coils) into the existing cylinder head or replacing the cylinder head altogether.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starts, rough idling, poor acceleration, or the check engine light illuminating.
    *   Solution: Locate the leak with a smoke machine, then replace the faulty hoses and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, the 6.8L V10 also suffers from spark plug thread issues. Plugs can eject, leading to similar symptoms: a loud popping noise, misfires, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Install thread inserts or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Description/Symptoms: Audible ticking or hissing sound, especially when the engine is cold, diminishing as it warms up. Can also cause decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken manifold or repair the leak with a new gasket and bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Power Stroke Diesel V8**

*   **Cam Position Sensor (CPS) Failure**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per injector.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts between gears, especially when cold. Transmission may slip under load.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid change and filter replacement might help, but often requires a transmission rebuild or replacement of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3000+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, especially when accelerating. Can also cause overheating and complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Often recommended to also flush the transmission cooler lines and replace the fluid and filter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noise from the front end, especially when going over bumps or turning. Excessive tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end of the van sitting lower than normal, reduced load-carrying capacity, rough ride. Cracks can be visually inspected.

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford E-350 Super Duty, while a workhorse, presents several common issues due to its age. Engine problems, especially spark plug thread failures in the Triton V8/V10 engines and injector issues in the diesel, are significant concerns. Transmission problems like hard shifting are also common and can be costly. Suspension wear and electrical glitches add to the potential maintenance burden. Rust is a prevalent exterior issue, especially in regions with road salt. While individual repairs might be manageable, the cumulative cost of addressing these common problems can be substantial, especially for a vehicle of this age.
