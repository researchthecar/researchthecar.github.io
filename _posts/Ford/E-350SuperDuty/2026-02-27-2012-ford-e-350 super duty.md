### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a workhorse vehicle that generally offers good reliability for its class. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the gasoline V8 engines, specifically spark plug ejection on the Triton models and camshaft position sensor failures. Automatic transmissions can also experience issues like torque converter problems or solenoid failures, particularly with higher mileage. Suspension components, such as leaf springs and ball joints, are subject to wear due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues like alternator failure are not uncommon. While not immune to problems, most issues are repairable and often stem from the demands placed on a commercial-grade vehicle. Regular maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly can significantly extend the lifespan and reliability of the E-350.
