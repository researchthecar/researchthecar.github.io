### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Ford E-350 Super Duty demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, especially for its intended heavy-duty applications. The V8 and V10 Triton engines, while robust, can be prone to spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks, which are repairable with proper procedures. The older 4-speed automatic transmission may require attention for torque converter issues or overheating under heavy use. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear, particularly in commercial service. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon with age and mileage. Overall, the E-350 is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential engine and transmission-specific maintenance needs and be prepared for repairs related to high-mileage wear on suspension and electrical parts.
