The 2002 Ford E-350 Super Duty is a full-size van renowned for its durability and workhorse capabilities. Engine options include the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp and 425 lb-ft of torque), and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque). A 4-speed automatic transmission was the standard option for all engines. Owners often praise the E-350 for its spaciousness and towing capacity but criticize its fuel economy and aging design.

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford E-350 Super Duty has some common issues, particularly related to the engine (spark plug blowouts, sensor failures) and transmission (hard shifting, slipping). Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs also tend to wear out with age and use. Rust is a major concern for vehicles of this age, particularly in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive (sensor replacements, door handles), others like transmission rebuilds or rust repair can be quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
