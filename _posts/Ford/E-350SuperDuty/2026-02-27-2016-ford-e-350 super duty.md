### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford E-350 Super Duty generally demonstrates good mechanical resilience, especially with the newer 6.2L V8 and 6R140 transmission. However, older engine options like the 5.4L and 6.8L Triton V8s are prone to spark plug ejection and related issues, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4R75E, can involve torque converter or solenoid pack failures. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints may require attention due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are not uncommon. Overall, while capable, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to its workhorse design, with maintenance history and specific component care being crucial for long-term reliability.
