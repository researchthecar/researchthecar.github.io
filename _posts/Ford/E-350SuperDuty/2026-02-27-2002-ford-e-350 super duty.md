### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford E-350 Super Duty generally demonstrates good reliability, especially with the robust 7.3L Power Stroke diesel engine. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as spark plug blowout on the Triton V8 engines, and common transmission problems like torque converter failure or solenoid issues, particularly with the 4R70W. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear over time due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical components like the alternator are also a point to monitor. While not immune to problems, addressing these known issues proactively can ensure the E-350 remains a dependable vehicle for its intended purpose.
