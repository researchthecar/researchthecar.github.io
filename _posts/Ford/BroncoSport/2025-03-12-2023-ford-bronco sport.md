Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues reported for the 2023 Ford Bronco Sport, categorized by component. The Bronco Sport is a compact SUV known for its off-road capabilities and rugged styling, appealing to those who want a vehicle with some adventure-ready features but in a smaller, more fuel-efficient package than the full-size Bronco. Engine options include a 1.5L EcoBoost inline-3 producing 181 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4 producing 250 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the Bronco Sport's practicality and design, while others find the base engine underpowered or wish for more interior space.

**Engine**

**1.5L EcoBoost I3**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring them to add oil between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings or noticing a burning smell.
    * Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels. If consumption is excessive, a dealer inspection may be required to check for leaks or internal engine issues. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $8,000+ (depending on the repair needed, from sensor replacements to complete engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnostic codes often point to cylinder misfires.
    * Solution: Replacing faulty spark plugs or ignition coils can sometimes resolve the issue. In more severe cases, it may indicate a problem with fuel injectors or cylinder head.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause and extent of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

**8-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced rough or jerky shifting, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. Some report hesitation when shifting between gears.
    * Solution: A software update to the transmission control module (TCM) may improve shift quality. In some cases, replacing valve body components within the transmission can resolve the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ (depending on the repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Suspension Noise**
    * Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported clunking or rattling noises emanating from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This has been attributed to issues with the rear shocks.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace the rear shocks if they are found to be faulty. Checking and tightening all suspension components may also help.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the parts and labor involved)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 3 or SYNC 4 infotainment system can freeze, become unresponsive, or randomly restart. This may affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    * Solution: Performing a system reset or installing software updates can sometimes resolve the issue. In some cases, the infotainment module may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for software updates) - $800+ (for module replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced excessive battery drain, particularly when the vehicle is left parked for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine.
    * Solution: Check for any aftermarket accessories that may be drawing power when the vehicle is off. Have the battery and charging system tested. In some cases, a software update can address parasitic drain issues.
