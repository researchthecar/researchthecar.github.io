Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2021 Ford Bronco Sport, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options, with detailed descriptions, solutions, and estimated costs.

The 2021 Ford Bronco Sport marked the return of the Bronco name in a smaller, crossover-SUV form. It was available with two engine options: the 1.5L EcoBoost inline-3, producing 181 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and the 2.0L EcoBoost inline-4, delivering 250 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Bronco Sport's rugged styling, off-road capability (especially in Badlands trim), and user-friendly technology. Common dislikes include its relatively small cargo space, some cheap-feeling interior materials, and the 1.5L engine's sometimes sluggish performance.

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford Bronco Sport has some common issues for the first model year. The 1.5L EcoBoost engine has issues with misfires and excessive oil consumption, and the 8-speed transmission has been reported to have rough shifting. The electrical issues with the infotainment system freezing or cameras failing are also commonly reported, as well as issues with the sunroof and rattling noises.
