The primary areas of concern are minor, with some reports of coolant leaks on the 1.5L EcoBoost engine and occasional glitches with the infotainment system. Battery drain issues, while not widespread, can occur. The suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally holding up well. For potential buyers, opting for the 2.0L engine may offer a slightly more robust powertrain experience. Addressing any early signs of coolant loss or electrical quirks promptly is recommended.
