### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford Courier is a generally robust light commercial vehicle. Its diesel engines, particularly the Duratorq TDCi variants, are prone to issues like injector failure and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. The manual transmission is relatively solid, though clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Automatic transmissions may experience solenoid issues. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear over time, especially under heavy use. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are not uncommon. Rust can be a significant concern depending on the vehicle's climate history. Overall, while capable, potential buyers should be aware of these specific reliability points and factor in potential repair costs.
