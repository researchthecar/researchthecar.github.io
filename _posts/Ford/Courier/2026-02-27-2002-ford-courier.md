### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford Courier is a capable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The diesel engine variants are more prone to specific problems like turbocharger and glow plug failures. Transmission issues, particularly clutch wear on manuals and solenoid problems on automatics, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out, and rust is a concern for vehicles in humid or coastal environments. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and window regulator problems are also documented. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Couriers remain functional with proper maintenance and timely repairs, making them a viable option for budget-conscious utility needs.
