### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Ford Courier is a capable workhorse with a generally reliable mechanical foundation. The diesel engines, while offering good torque, can be prone to issues with the turbocharger and injectors, especially with higher mileage or less diligent maintenance. The manual transmission's clutch is a common wear item. Suspension components like bushings can degrade over time, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical gremlins, such as alternator failure and wiring problems, are not uncommon as the vehicle ages. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Overall, the Courier is a solid choice for those prioritizing utility and affordability, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas that may require attention.
