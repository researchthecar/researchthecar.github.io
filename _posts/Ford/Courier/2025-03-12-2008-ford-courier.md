The 2008 Ford Courier is a light commercial vehicle, primarily a pickup truck, popular in various global markets, especially Australia and parts of South America and Europe. The 2008 model year typically offered several engine options, including petrol and diesel variants. One common engine was a 2.0-liter Duratorq diesel engine, producing around 100-130 horsepower and 230-280 Nm of torque, depending on the specific tuning. Other engine options included smaller petrol engines like a 1.6L. Transmission options were generally a 5-speed manual. Owners often appreciate the Courier for its practicality, reliability, and fuel efficiency, making it suitable for commercial use and light duties. Common dislikes include its relatively basic interior, ride quality, and limited safety features compared to modern vehicles.
