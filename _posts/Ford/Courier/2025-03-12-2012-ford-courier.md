The 2012 Ford Courier is a light commercial vehicle, primarily a cab chassis or van, known for its practicality and fuel efficiency. It was available with several engine options, including a 1.6L Duratec petrol engine, a 2.0L Duratorq diesel engine, and a 2.2L Duratorq diesel engine. The 1.6L gasoline engine produced around 105 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options generally included a 5-speed manual. Owners generally appreciate the Courier's compact size, maneuverability, and cargo capacity. However, common dislikes include basic interior features, limited power with the smaller engines, and potential for higher repair costs due to its commercial vehicle nature.

**Engine**

**1.6L Duratec Petrol**

*   **Coil Pack Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, reduced power, and a check engine light with codes indicating a cylinder misfire.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty coil pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $350
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Duratorq Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, warning lights on the dashboard (DPF light), and the engine may enter a "limp home" mode. Often occurs due to short trips not allowing the DPF to regenerate properly.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration of the DPF (performed by a mechanic or sometimes automatically during extended highway driving), or replacement of the DPF if severely clogged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (forced regeneration) - $1000+ (DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor fuel economy, excessive smoke from the exhaust, engine knocking, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.2L Duratorq Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, difficulty starting, and reduced fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

*   **Clutch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage (engine revs higher than normal during acceleration), difficulty shifting gears, a burning smell, and a soft or spongy clutch pedal feel.
    *   Solution: Replace the clutch disc, pressure plate, and possibly the flywheel.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Gear Grinding**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noisy shifting, especially when shifting into specific gears, difficulty engaging gears, and a grinding sound.
    *   Solution: Could be due to worn synchronizers, damaged gears, or low transmission fluid. May require a transmission rebuild or replacement, or simply topping off or replacing the fluid (less likely to fully resolve the issue).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid top-off) - $2000+ (transmission rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Poor handling and steering response.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ (depending on the number and location of the bushings)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor ride quality, reduced handling and control, and potential tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on brand and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle is difficult to start, or the battery is frequently dead.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the parasitic drain and repair the faulty component (e.g., faulty alternator, wiring issue, or a module staying active when the vehicle is off). Replacing the battery alone will not fix this issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Central Locking Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Central locking system not functioning correctly (doors not locking/unlocking, remote not working).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the central locking system (check fuses, wiring, and the central locking module). Replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (depending on the issue and parts needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, especially around the wheel arches, door bottoms, and underbody.
    *   Solution: Rust removal and body repair, followed by painting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inner or outer door handle breaks, making it difficult or impossible to open the door.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford Courier, while generally reliable, can experience issues related to its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical components, and body. The severity and cost of these issues vary greatly. Diesel engine problems (DPF, injectors, turbo) tend to be more expensive to repair than gasoline engine or other component issues. Rust can be a significant concern in certain climates. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these common issues and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
