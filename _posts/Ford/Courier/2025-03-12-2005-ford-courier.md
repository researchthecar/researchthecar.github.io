The 2005 Ford Courier is a light commercial vehicle, often used as a small pickup truck or van. For the 2005 model year, it was primarily available in Australia and other similar markets, and not commonly sold in North America. The engine options typically included a 2.0L inline-4 petrol engine and a 2.5L diesel engine. The 2.0L petrol engine produced around 125 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate its practicality, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability in urban environments. Common complaints often involve its basic interior, limited cargo space compared to larger trucks, and susceptibility to rust.
