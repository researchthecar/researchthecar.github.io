The 2004 Ford Courier is a light commercial vehicle popular in Australia and other markets. This generation offered a range of engines, primarily the 2.5L WL diesel engine and the 2.6L G6 petrol engine.

Owners often praise the Courier for its reliability and practicality as a work vehicle, while criticisms usually focus on its basic features, comfort, and relatively low power output.
