**Introduction:**

The 2001 Ford Courier, a compact pickup truck, was available with two engine options: a 2.5-liter inline-four engine and a 3.0-liter V6 engine. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5-liter engine produced 110 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.0-liter V6 produced 140 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. The Courier was praised for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and affordable price point. However, it was also known to have some drawbacks, including limited power, a cramped interior, and a lack of modern features.
