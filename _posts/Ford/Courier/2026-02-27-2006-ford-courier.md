### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford Courier demonstrates a mixed reliability profile. Its diesel engines, particularly the Duratorq TDCi variants, are prone to issues like turbocharger failure and injector problems, while the petrol engine appears more robust. Transmission issues are generally related to wear and tear on clutch components for manuals and potential fluid leaks for automatics. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can require attention over time. Electrical system concerns often center around the alternator and wiring. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate and maintenance. Interior issues are typically minor, such as HVAC fan motor failures. Overall, while capable, potential buyers should be aware of these common problem areas and factor in potential repair costs.
