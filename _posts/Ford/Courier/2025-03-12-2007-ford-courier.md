The 2007 Ford Courier is a light commercial vehicle, primarily a cab chassis or pickup, popular for its versatility and practicality. In 2007, the Courier was primarily offered with a 2.0L Petrol engine, producing around 92kW (123 horsepower) and 175Nm of torque. A 2.5L Turbo Diesel was also available, producing around 80kW and 266Nm. These engines were typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Owners often appreciate the Courier's reliability, affordability, and compact size, making it suitable for urban environments and small businesses. Common dislikes include its basic interior, limited features, and somewhat underpowered engines, especially when carrying heavy loads.

**Engine**

**2.0L Petrol**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, leading to the need for frequent top-ups. This can be noticeable as blue smoke from the exhaust, particularly during start-up or acceleration.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, potential fixes can range from replacing valve stem seals to piston rings. A compression test and leak-down test can help diagnose the source of the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Turbo Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The diesel injectors can be prone to failure, resulting in rough idling, reduced power, black smoke from the exhaust, and potentially difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty injectors is typically required. It's advisable to replace all injectors at the same time to ensure balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+
