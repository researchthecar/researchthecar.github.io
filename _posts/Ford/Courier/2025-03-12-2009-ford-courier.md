The 2009 Ford Courier is a light commercial vehicle, primarily a cab chassis or pickup, known for its practicality and affordability. The available engine options for the 2009 Courier in the Australian market, where it was commonly sold, included a 2.0L petrol engine producing approximately 92kW (123 hp) and 175 Nm of torque, as well as a 2.5L turbo diesel engine producing roughly 85kW (114 hp) and 284 Nm of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, though some models offered a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Courier for its reliability and suitability for work-related tasks, while common dislikes include the basic interior and relatively low power output compared to larger utility vehicles.

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford Courier, while generally a reliable workhorse, does have some common issues. The 2.5L turbo diesel engine can suffer from EGR valve and injector failures, which can be moderately expensive to repair. The 5-speed manual transmission is known to experience clutch failures and the automatic transmission has harsh shifting problems. Suspension components, particularly the leaf springs, can sag over time. Additionally, there are electrical issues related to the central locking system, and interior issues such as dashboard cracking. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these potential problems when considering a used 2009 Ford Courier.
