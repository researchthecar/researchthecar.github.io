### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford Courier, particularly models equipped with the Duratorq diesel engines, can experience issues related to the turbocharger and fuel injectors, which are common for diesel powertrains of this era. The manual transmission's clutch is a wear item that may require replacement. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can also wear over time, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical problems, such as alternator failure, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on the vehicle's climate and maintenance history. Overall, while not plagued by widespread critical failures, owners should be aware of potential diesel-specific engine maintenance and general wear-and-tear items.
