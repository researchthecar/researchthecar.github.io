The 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid is a compact hybrid hatchback that offered good fuel economy and a comfortable ride. Its main selling points were its practicality, fuel efficiency, and relatively affordable price. However, it was also criticized for its lower-than-advertised MPG, some reported reliability issues, and a less engaging driving experience compared to some competitors. The 2013 C-Max Hybrid comes exclusively with a 2.0L Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 188 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. It utilizes an eCVT (electronically controlled continuously variable transmission).

**Electric Motor**

**2.0L Atkinson-cycle Four-Cylinder Engine with Electric Motor**

*   **Motor Generator Unit (MGU) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MGU is responsible for providing electric power for hybrid operation. Symptoms can include a loss of electric assist, reduced fuel economy, warning lights (e.g., wrench light, check engine light), and potentially a complete inability to start the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty MGU.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**eCVT (Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or delayed shifts, slipping during acceleration, or harsh engagement of gears. This can be caused by worn internal components or issues with the transmission control module (TCM).
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the TCM can resolve the issue. If the damage is more severe, transmission repair or replacement is necessary.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging/Worn Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle appears lower than normal, especially when loaded. Can lead to poor ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Hybrid Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, decreased electric range, warning lights related to the hybrid system, and eventual inability to drive in electric-only mode.
    *   Solution: Hybrid battery replacement. Some owners explore refurbishing options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks to function.

**Summary:**

The 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid can be a fuel-efficient and practical vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The most serious and costly problems revolve around the hybrid system (MGU and hybrid battery), and transmission, potentially leading to expensive repairs. Electrical issues, such as power door locks and infotainment system problems, are less severe but still warrant attention. Suspension and interior component failures are also common and can degrade the ownership experience. Pre-purchase inspections and thorough research are highly recommended.
