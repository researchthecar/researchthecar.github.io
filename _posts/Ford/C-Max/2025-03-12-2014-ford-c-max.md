The 2014 Ford C-Max Hybrid is a compact hybrid hatchback that offers good fuel economy and a comfortable ride. It came standard with a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 188 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option was an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (eCVT). People appreciate the C-Max for its fuel efficiency and practicality, but some dislike its smaller-than-advertised real-world MPG and occasionally clunky transmission behavior. Some people find the interior storage options limited.

**Electric Motor**

**2.0L Atkinson-Cycle Four-Cylinder Engine with Electric Motor**

*   **Inverter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The inverter is responsible for converting DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor. Inverter failure can cause the vehicle to lose power, display warning lights, and may result in the vehicle being unable to start or drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the inverter module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**eCVT (Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission)**

*   **Transmission Jerking/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported jerking, hesitation, or a lurching sensation during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds or when transitioning between electric and gasoline power. This may also be accompanied by unusual noises.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update can address the issue. However, in other cases, replacement of the transmission is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software update $100-$300, Transmission replacement $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Battery**

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, decreased electric-only range, warning lights on the dashboard (e.g., "Service Engine Soon," "Check Hybrid System"), and potential inability to start or drive the vehicle. Batteries have a lifespan, and with age, they can degrade.
    *   Solution: Hybrid battery replacement or reconditioning.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Reconditioning $1,000-$2,000, Replacement $3,000-$8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature sagging of the rear suspension, leading to a lower ride height and potential bottoming out over bumps. This can be more pronounced when carrying passengers or cargo.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear springs or shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MyFord Touch System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The MyFord Touch infotainment system (if equipped) has been known for being slow, unresponsive, prone to freezing, and difficult to use. Problems include unresponsive touch screen, navigation issues, and difficulty pairing devices.
    *   Solution: Software updates may improve performance. Replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may be necessary in some cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update $0 - $100, APIM replacement $500 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Door Locks Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks may fail to operate correctly, either failing to lock/unlock or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, especially during rain, due to clogged sunroof drain tubes.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or unclogging the sunroof drain tubes. In some cases, damaged seals may require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Cleaning $50-$150, Seal Replacement $100-$300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Windshield Wiper Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The windshield wipers stop working, either intermittently or completely.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the windshield wiper motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$350+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford C-Max Hybrid, while fuel-efficient and practical, does have some common issues. The most concerning are the potential for inverter failure and hybrid battery degradation, both of which can be costly to repair. Electrical issues with the MyFord Touch system can be frustrating, and suspension and sunroof problems can also occur. While not all C-Max owners will experience these issues, it's important to be aware of them when considering a purchase or maintaining an existing vehicle. The issues range from relatively minor (sunroof leaks, power door lock malfunctions) to potentially major and costly (inverter failure, battery replacement).
