**2017 Ford C-Max**

The 2017 Ford C-Max is a hybrid electric vehicle available in two engine options: a 2.0-liter I-4 Atkinson-cycle engine with an electric motor (188 horsepower, 129 lb-ft of torque) and a 2.5-liter I-4 Atkinson-cycle engine with an electric motor (195 horsepower, 155 lb-ft of torque).
