The 2017 Ford C-Max is a hybrid hatchback that offers a blend of fuel efficiency and practicality. It comes in two main variants: the C-Max Hybrid and the C-Max Energi (plug-in hybrid). Both models are equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine paired with an electric motor and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The combined output is 188 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the C-Max for its excellent fuel economy, comfortable ride, and spacious interior. However, some common complaints include a smaller cargo area than expected due to the battery pack, a somewhat sluggish acceleration, and the continuously variable transmission can be noisy and lead to issues over time.

**Electric Motor**

**Electric Motor (Both Hybrid and Energi)**

*   **High Voltage Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced electric-only range, increased reliance on the gasoline engine, error messages related to battery performance, and reduced overall fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Battery replacement or individual module replacement within the battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ (depending on whether the entire battery pack or individual modules are replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) - Both Hybrid and Energi**

*   **CVT Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping, shuddering, delayed engagement, unusual noises (whining or buzzing), and eventual complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,500 - $5,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, difficulty accelerating, and abnormal vibrations.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the rear of the vehicle, especially when driving over bumps. Poor handling, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Inverter Coolant Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, check engine light, reduced performance, hybrid system malfunction. The inverter is responsible for converting DC to AC for the electric motor. Insufficient coolant flow can lead to its overheating and eventual failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the inverter coolant pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $900+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door not locking or unlocking with the remote or door switch.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Blurry, distorted, or no image displayed when in reverse.
    *   Solution: Replacing the backup camera unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **MyFord Touch/Sync System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: System freezes, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation issues, and screen glitches.
    *   Solution: Software updates or replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (Software update may be free; APIM replacement is expensive)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford C-Max can be a fuel-efficient and practical vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The most concerning are related to the high voltage battery degradation, CVT transmission failures, and Inverter Coolant Pump Failure, which can be costly to repair. Other problems like suspension bushing wear and infotainment glitches are less severe but still worth considering. Thoroughly inspect the vehicle and inquire about the maintenance history, especially related to the hybrid system and transmission, before making a purchase.
