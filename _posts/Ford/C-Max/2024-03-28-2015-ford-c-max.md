## 2015 Ford C-Max

The 2015 Ford C-Max is a compact hybrid minivan available with two different powertrains. The first is a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) that produces 141 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque. The second powertrain option is a plug-in hybrid that combines a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with an electric motor and a CVT, producing 188 horsepower and 231 lb-ft of torque. The C-Max is praised for its fuel efficiency, spacious cabin, and comfortable ride, but it is criticized for its lack of power and uninspiring driving dynamics.
