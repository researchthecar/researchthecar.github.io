The 2016 Ford C-Max is a hybrid hatchback known for its fuel efficiency and practicality. It came standard with a 2.0-liter Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor, producing a combined 188 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through an electronic continuously variable transmission (eCVT). Owners generally like the C-Max for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and excellent gas mileage. Common dislikes include its limited cargo space compared to other hatchbacks, the sometimes-sluggish acceleration, and reports of diminished battery range over time. The 2016 C-Max was available in two main trims: the C-Max Hybrid and the C-Max Energi (plug-in hybrid).

**Electric Motor**

**2.0L Atkinson Cycle Four-Cylinder Engine with Electric Motor**

*   **Hybrid Battery Degradation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced electric-only range, decreased overall fuel economy, the hybrid system warning light illuminating. This is due to the natural degradation of the battery cells over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the hybrid battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cooling System Failure (Hybrid Components)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating of the hybrid system components, particularly the inverter or the battery. This can lead to reduced performance or complete system shutdown. The symptoms may include warning lights and decreased fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the cooling system, which may include checking the coolant level, pump function, and any leaks in the system. Depending on the diagnosis, the fix may require replacing the water pump or lines and/or the hybrid system's cooling system components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**eCVT Transmission**

*   **Transmission Jerking/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky movements during acceleration or deceleration, especially at lower speeds. This can be due to issues with the eCVT's control software or wear within the transmission itself.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic scan to check for error codes is the first step. It could require reprogramming the transmission control module (TCM) or, in more severe cases, replacing or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reprogram) to $3,000+ (replacement/rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or rough roads. This can be due to worn or damaged suspension components, such as struts, bushings, or sway bar links.
    *   Solution: Inspect the rear suspension components for wear or damage. Replace any worn or damaged parts, such as struts, bushings, or sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side depending on the parts needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **SYNC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation malfunctions, and error messages. These issues can stem from software glitches or hardware failures within the SYNC system.
    *   Solution: Try performing a master reset of the SYNC system. If that doesn't work, a software update may be necessary. In some cases, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) to $500+ (APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: 17V-350: Certain vehicles failed to conform to the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 101, “Controls and Displays.”
    *   Recalls: 18V-487: Ford Motor Company (Ford) is recalling certain 2013-2016 Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ vehicles originally sold or ever registered in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Virginia and the Virgin Islands. The affected vehicles have a driver's air bag inflator that may rupture due to prolonged exposure to high absolute humidity, temperature and temperature cycling.
    *   Recalls: 18V-749: Ford Motor Company (Ford) is recalling certain 2013-2017 Ford Focus vehicles equipped with a gasoline engine, and 2013-2019 Ford Escape and C-MAX vehicles. A component within the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) may experience abnormal electrical overstress.
*   **Power Door Lock Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power door locks failing to operate correctly, either intermittently or completely. This can affect one or more doors and may be caused by a faulty door lock actuator or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the problem to identify the faulty actuator or wiring. Replace the defective door lock actuator or repair any wiring issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear liftgate will not stay open on its own and falls down or closes unexpectedly. This is caused by worn or weak liftgate struts (also known as gas springs).
    *   Solution: Replacing the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters either not working at all or working intermittently. This may affect only one seat or both front seats and can be due to a faulty heating element or a problem with the seat heater switch.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the seat heater malfunction, which may require checking the heating element, wiring, and switch. Replace any faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per seat.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford C-Max has some common issues spanning its hybrid powertrain, electrical systems, and other components. Hybrid battery degradation is a major concern, carrying a significant replacement cost. The SYNC system problems and power door lock issues are also fairly common electrical complaints. Liftgate struts failing are common on vehicles of this age. While the C-Max offers good fuel economy and practicality, potential buyers should be aware of these potential maintenance costs and issues, especially concerning the hybrid components.
