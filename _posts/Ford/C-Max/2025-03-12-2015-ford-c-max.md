The 2015 Ford C-Max is a hybrid hatchback available in two configurations: the C-Max Hybrid and the C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid. Both models utilize a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The combined system output is 188 horsepower and 129 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the C-Max for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and practical hatchback design. However, some common complaints include the less-than-stellar real-world fuel economy (especially compared to the advertised MPG), the smaller cargo space due to the battery pack, and occasional issues with the hybrid system.

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford C-Max, while appreciated for its fuel efficiency, does present some common issues. The most concerning relate to the hybrid system, particularly the inverter and battery pack, which can be costly to repair. Issues with the CVT, electrical system, and suspension can also arise. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others can lead to significant repair bills, making it essential to thoroughly inspect a used C-Max and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
