### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ford C-Max is a generally reliable vehicle, especially the hybrid models, with no single component consistently failing across a large number of vehicles. The most notable potential issues revolve around the hybrid system's high-voltage battery and coolant leaks, which can be costly to repair. For non-hybrid variants, transmission issues with the Powershift automatic (if equipped) and some engine cooling system concerns with the EcoBoost engine are worth noting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, can also occur. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these specific potential problems, the 2014 C-Max can be a dependable choice.
