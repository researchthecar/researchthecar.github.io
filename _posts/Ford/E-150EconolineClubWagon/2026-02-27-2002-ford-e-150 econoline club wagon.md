### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford E-150 Econoline Club Wagon is a capable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine reliability is generally good, but the V6 and V8 engines can suffer from intake manifold gasket leaks and spark plug blowout issues, particularly the 5.4L V8 which also has potential camshaft sensor problems. Transmission issues, especially with the 4R70W and 4R100 automatics, often involve torque converter clutch problems or overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear. Electrical gremlins can arise from the Body Control Module, and alternators may fail prematurely. Exterior rust is a concern in certain climates, and interior HVAC blend doors can fail. Regular maintenance and inspection of these known problem areas are crucial for maintaining the longevity and reliability of this van.
