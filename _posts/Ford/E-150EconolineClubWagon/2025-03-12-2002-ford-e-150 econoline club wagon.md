Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2002 Ford E-150 Econoline Club Wagon, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options. The 2002 Ford E-150 Econoline Club Wagon is a popular choice for those needing a spacious and versatile vehicle. It was often used for commercial purposes, passenger transport, and conversions into campers or recreational vehicles. Owners appreciate its reliability, cargo capacity, and straightforward maintenance. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues. The 2002 E-150 was available with several engine options including the 4.2L Essex V6 (200 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque), the 4.6L Triton V8 (225 hp and 290 lb-ft of torque), and the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with the 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission. Some common dislikes are its fuel economy and handling characteristics due to its size.

**Engine**

**4.2L Essex V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, rough running engine, possible overheating. Coolant may leak externally or internally, causing white smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden loud popping noise from the engine bay, misfire, loss of power. This is due to insufficient threads in the cylinder head for the spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Install thread repair inserts (e.g., Time-Sert or Helicoil) to reinforce the spark plug threads or replace the cylinder head (more expensive).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per cylinder, depending on repair method. Replacing the cylinder head would be significantly more.
