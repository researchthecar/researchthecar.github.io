The 2005 Ford Freestyle was Ford's entry into the crossover SUV market, offering three rows of seating and a car-like ride. It came equipped with a 3.0L Duratec V6 engine producing 203 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and an Aisin 6-speed automatic transmission on later models. Owners often praised the Freestyle for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and good fuel economy for its class. Criticisms typically centered on the CVT's performance, perceived lack of power, and some reliability issues.
