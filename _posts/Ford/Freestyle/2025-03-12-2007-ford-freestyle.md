The 2007 Ford Freestyle is a crossover SUV that aimed to combine the space of a minivan with the styling of an SUV. It was only available with a 3.0L Duratec V6 engine producing 203 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Many owners appreciated the Freestyle's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively good fuel economy for its size. However, common complaints included the lackluster performance of the engine, the unreliability of the CVT transmission, and some electrical issues.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford Freestyle, while offering a spacious interior and comfortable ride, is plagued by several common issues. The most significant and costly of these is the potential for CVT transmission failure. Other issues, such as electrical problems and suspension wear, are also common and contribute to the overall ownership cost. While individual repair costs for the non-transmission issues may seem manageable, the frequency with which they occur can make the Freestyle a potentially expensive vehicle to maintain, especially given its age.
