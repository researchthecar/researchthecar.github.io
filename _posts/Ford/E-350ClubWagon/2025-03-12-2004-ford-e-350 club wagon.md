The 2004 Ford E-350 Club Wagon is a full-size van known for its spacious interior, robust towing capacity, and overall utility. Available engine options included a 5.4L Triton V8, a 6.8L Triton V10, and a 7.3L Power Stroke Diesel (early 2004 models). The 5.4L V8 produced around 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. A common complaint among owners is the vehicle's fuel economy, especially with the larger engines. Owners appreciate the E-350's ability to haul large families and cargo, but some find the handling less refined compared to modern vans.
