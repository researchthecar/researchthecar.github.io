### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford E-350 Club Wagon, particularly models equipped with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, can present significant reliability challenges related to the engine's complex systems, including EGR and oil coolers, and head gaskets. Gasoline V8 and V10 engines are more prone to spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks. Transmission issues, especially with the 4R70W, can involve torque converter problems and overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention over time. Electrical issues such as instrument cluster and alternator failures are also noted. While the exterior can be susceptible to rust and door hardware issues, interior components like the HVAC blower motor are common wear items. Overall, while capable, the E-350 requires diligent maintenance, and owners should be aware of the specific potential failure points, especially with the diesel variants.
