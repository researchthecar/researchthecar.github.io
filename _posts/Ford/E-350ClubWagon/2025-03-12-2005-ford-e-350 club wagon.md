The 2005 Ford E-350 Club Wagon is a full-size passenger van known for its spacious interior, robust build, and towing capability. This model year came with several engine options: a 5.4L Triton V8 producing around 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.8L Triton V10 producing around 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the van's utility and passenger capacity, while common complaints include its fuel economy, bulky size, and some reliability issues related to its age and mileage.

**Engine**

    *   Solution: Repairing the cylinder head threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Helicoil) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the repair method and if the head needs to be removed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Phaser Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise, especially on start-up, rough idling, and loss of power. This issue affects the variable camshaft timing system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft phasers, timing chains, chain tensioners, and possibly the VCT (Variable Cam Timing) solenoids.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud ticking or hissing sound coming from the engine, especially when cold. Decreased fuel economy and potential exhaust fumes entering the cabin.
