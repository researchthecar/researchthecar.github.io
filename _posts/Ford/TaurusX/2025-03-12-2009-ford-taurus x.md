The 2009 Ford Taurus X is a crossover SUV that offers seating for up to seven passengers. It was only offered with one engine and transmission option, a 3.5L Duratec V6 engine producing 263 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6F50 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Taurus X for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available all-wheel drive. However, some common complaints include its bland styling, lower than average fuel economy, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**3.5L Duratec V6**

*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine may exhibit a rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. As the chain wears, the engine may run rough, misfire, or experience a loss of power. In severe cases, the timing chain can break, causing significant engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and possibly the VCT (Variable Cam Timing) solenoids is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump on the 3.5L Duratec V6 is located internally, driven by the timing chain. When it fails, coolant can leak into the engine oil, causing damage to bearings and other internal components. Common signs include overheating, coolant loss, and milky-colored oil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump and potentially the timing chain components as well. If coolant has contaminated the oil for an extended period, engine flushing or even engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $3,500+ (depending on severity of engine damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6F50 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. The transmission may also slip or fail to engage gears properly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter is the most common fix. In some cases, damage to the transmission may also require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, erratic shifting patterns, or complete loss of gear engagement. Diagnostic codes related to solenoid or valve body malfunctions may be present.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body or, in some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits noticeably lower than the front. This is more common in models with rear air suspension (if equipped), but can also occur with standard coil springs due to age and wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs or, if equipped, the air springs. For air suspension, check for leaks in the air lines and compressor as well.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may stop working intermittently or completely. A clicking sound may be heard from the motor when the switch is activated.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC system may blow hot air on one side and cold air on the other, or the temperature may be stuck at a single setting. Clicking noises may be heard from behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty blend door actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on location and complexity of access).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The liftgate struggles to stay open or slams shut unexpectedly.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the liftgate struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sunroof may leak, fail to open or close properly, or make excessive noise during operation.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the sunroof mechanism, which may involve cleaning and lubrication, replacement of seals, or replacement of the motor or track components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford Taurus X has a few common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most serious and costly issues revolve around the engine (timing chain and water pump) and transmission (torque converter and valve body). Electrical and suspension problems are also fairly common. While not all vehicles will experience these issues, it is wise to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to assess the overall condition of the vehicle. The severity of potential repairs ranges from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
