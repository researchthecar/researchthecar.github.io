The 2008 Ford Taurus X is a spacious crossover SUV that offers three rows of seating and ample cargo space. All 2008 Taurus X models came equipped with a 3.5L Duratec 35 V6 engine that produced 263 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission option was a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Taurus X for its comfortable ride, generous interior space, and available all-wheel drive. Common complaints include its bland styling, relatively poor fuel economy, and some reliability concerns, particularly with certain powertrain components and electrical systems.
