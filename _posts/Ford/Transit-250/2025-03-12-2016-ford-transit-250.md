Here's a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints associated with the 2016 Ford Transit-250, broken down by category and engine/transmission option. The 2016 Ford Transit-250 is a versatile cargo and passenger van known for its spacious interior, multiple configurations, and relatively good fuel economy compared to older vans. Engine options include a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 (275 hp, 260 lb-ft torque), a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (310 hp, 400 lb-ft torque), and a 3.2L Power Stroke I5 diesel (185 hp, 350 lb-ft torque). All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Transit's driving dynamics, cargo capacity, and customization options, but some dislike its relatively unrefined interior and potential for certain mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling or whining noise from the engine, check engine light. Could be caused by oil sludge buildup restricting oil flow to the turbo.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger. Thorough engine oil flush and ensuring proper maintenance intervals are followed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, check engine light. Often occurs due to heat and age.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty ignition coil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (per coil)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L Ti-VCT V6**

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, hard starting, rough idling, poor fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty purge valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks around the valve cover gaskets or oil pan gasket, low oil level, burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the location and severity)
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.2L Power Stroke I5 Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent DPF regeneration cycles, check engine light related to DPF clogging. Can be caused by short trips that don't allow for full regeneration.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (if possible), replacement of the DPF (if severely clogged), address any underlying issues causing excessive soot production.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on the solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty injector(s), replacement of the faulty injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+ (per injector, including labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or jerky shifts, transmission slipping out of gear, unusual noises during shifting.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change (may provide temporary relief). In severe cases, transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the van sitting lower than normal, reduced ride quality, poor handling, especially when loaded.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty leaf springs if the van is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rods**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends, followed by a wheel alignment.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Flickering/Dimming Interior Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent flickering or dimming of interior lights, especially under load (e.g., using multiple accessories).
    *   Solution: Check the battery terminals for corrosion and ensure they are properly tightened. Inspect the alternator output. Could also be caused by a failing battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (cleaning terminals) - $500+ (alternator or battery replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford Transit-250, while generally a reliable work vehicle, does exhibit some common issues. The severity and cost of these issues vary. Turbocharger and DPF problems on the EcoBoost and Power Stroke engines can be quite expensive. Suspension issues such as leaf spring sag are also common especially on vehicles used commercially and can be costly. Electrical gremlins like flickering lights and door lock failures tend to be less severe in cost, but can be frustrating. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before purchasing. Regular maintenance, including timely oil changes and fluid flushes, can help mitigate some of these issues.
