The 2018 Ford Transit-250 is a versatile and popular van known for its spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and numerous configuration options. For the 2018 model year, it came with three engine choices: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing 275 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 generating 310 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L Power Stroke inline-5 diesel engine outputting 185 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Transit's practicality, ease of driving, and customizable nature. However, some common complaints include concerns about reliability, particularly with certain engine components, and fuel economy, especially with the gasoline engines.

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive turbo noise (whining or screeching), check engine light illumination. May also present with excessive oil consumption.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed turbocharger(s). In some cases, the oil feed lines may also need replacement due to sludge buildup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Intrusion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: White smoke from the exhaust, sweet coolant smell, coolant level dropping, potential for engine misfires and eventual engine failure due to coolant entering the cylinders. This is caused by cracking of the cylinder heads which allows coolant to leak into the combustion chamber.
    *   Solution: Replacement of cylinder head(s) or in severe cases, complete engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L Ti-VCT V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks on the engine block, especially around the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or front timing cover. May also notice a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the location of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.2L Power Stroke Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, reduced engine power, check engine light illumination, and potential for DPF clogging and failure.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (if possible), replacement of the DPF if it's severely clogged or damaged, inspection of related sensors and components (EGT sensors, differential pressure sensor).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, black smoke from the exhaust, reduced engine power, check engine light illumination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update may resolve the issue. In other cases, valve body issues could be to blame.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear suspension, rough ride, decreased load capacity, and potential for leaf spring breakage. Often more prevalent in vehicles that are frequently loaded to their maximum capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs with upgraded or heavy-duty springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery overnight or after short periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify parasitic drain, repair or replacement of the faulty component (e.g., faulty relay, module, or accessory).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Doors not locking or unlocking properly, unusual noises from the door lock mechanism.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, binding or sticking, unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the door tracks and rollers, adjustment of the door alignment, or replacement of worn rollers or cables.

    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2018 Ford Transit-250, while generally praised for its functionality, does have some notable issues. Engine problems, especially with the 3.5L EcoBoost (turbocharger and coolant intrusion) and 3.2L diesel (DPF and EGR), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, electrical gremlins, suspension problems, and sliding door malfunctions can also arise. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with potential costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider a thorough inspection before purchasing.
