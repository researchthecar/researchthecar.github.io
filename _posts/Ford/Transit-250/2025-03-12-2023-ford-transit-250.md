**Summary**

The 2023 Ford Transit-250, while offering considerable utility and customization, appears to have a range of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the EcoBoost variants, can be costly. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting, also appear, with repair costs that can vary widely. Electrical glitches and interior rattles also seem somewhat prevalent. While some issues are minor and inexpensive to fix (e.g., squeaking springs, rattles), others, such as turbocharger failure or complete transmission replacement, represent a significant financial burden. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle, test drive it thoroughly, and consider an extended warranty to mitigate potential repair costs.
