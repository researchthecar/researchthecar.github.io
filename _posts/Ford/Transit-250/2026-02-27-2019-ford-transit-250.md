### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Ford Transit-250 generally exhibits good reliability, especially for its class. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the engine (coolant and oil leaks for the V6, turbocharger concerns for EcoBoost, and DPF/glow plug issues for the diesel) and the transmission (harsh shifting). Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear over time, particularly with heavy use. Electrical issues such as battery drain and sensor failures are also noted. Exterior and interior components, while not immune to problems, show fewer widespread complaints. Overall, the Transit-250 is a dependable work vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential maintenance needs for the specific powertrain chosen and address any emerging issues promptly to maintain optimal performance and longevity.
