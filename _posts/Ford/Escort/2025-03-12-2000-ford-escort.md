The 2000 Ford Escort was a compact car available as a sedan or a ZX2 coupe. It was a fuel-efficient and affordable option, often praised for its simple design and ease of maintenance. However, like any older vehicle, it is prone to certain issues. The standard engine was a 2.0L SOHC 4-cylinder engine producing around 110 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Common dislikes include the somewhat unrefined engine noise, basic interior, and limited features compared to newer vehicles. Owners often appreciate its simplicity, affordability, and relatively good fuel economy for its age.
