### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford Escort, while a budget-friendly vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and class. Engine issues, particularly with coolant leaks and ignition components on the SPI engine, and head gasket/timing belt concerns on the Zetec, are notable. Automatic transmission problems often stem from solenoid failures or torque converter issues. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are prone to wear, and electrical issues such as alternator failure and window regulators are also reported. Rust can be a concern on lower body panels. Despite these potential issues, many problems are repairable, and with diligent maintenance, the Escort can remain a functional vehicle.
