The 2001 Ford Escort was a compact car offered as a sedan and a wagon. It was known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. While generally reliable, it has its share of common issues, typical for a vehicle of its age. The 2001 Escort came with a single engine option: a 2.0L SOHC inline-4 producing around 110 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Two transmission options were available: a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Some owners appreciate the Escort's simplicity and ease of maintenance, while others find its performance and interior dated compared to newer vehicles. Common dislikes include the lack of modern features and potential for rust.
