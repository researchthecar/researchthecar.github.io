The 2003 Ford Escort was a compact car known for its fuel efficiency and affordability. It came standard with a 2.0L SOHC 4-cylinder Zetec engine, producing 130 horsepower and 127 lb-ft of torque, mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciated the Escort for its simple design, ease of maintenance, and low price point. However, common complaints included a relatively bland driving experience, limited rear passenger space, and some reliability concerns typical of older, budget-friendly vehicles.
