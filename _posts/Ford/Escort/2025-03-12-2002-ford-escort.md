**Summary**

The 2002 Ford Escort, while generally a reliable and affordable car, can be prone to certain issues related to its age. Engine misfires and coolant leaks are common concerns, and the automatic transmission can experience shifting problems. Suspension components wear over time, and electrical issues like alternator and starter motor failures can occur. Rust is also a significant problem, especially in regions with harsh winter conditions. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission repair or rust removal, can be costly. Overall, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing, or consider obtaining a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic.
