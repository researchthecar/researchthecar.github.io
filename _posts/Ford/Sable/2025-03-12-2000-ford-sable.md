The 2000 Ford Sable, along with its sister car the Mercury Taurus, was a popular mid-size sedan known for its comfort and reliability. It offered two engine options: a 3.0L Vulcan V6 producing approximately 155 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L Duratec 24V V6 producing approximately 200 hp and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People liked the Sable for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and relatively affordable price. Common dislikes included its somewhat bland styling (especially the oval rear window on earlier models), and potential for some age-related mechanical issues.
