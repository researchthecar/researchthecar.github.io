### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford Sable presents a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components like the engines and transmissions are generally robust, specific issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and torque converter problems have been noted. Electrical components, particularly window regulators and instrument clusters, can be prone to failure. Suspension wear, especially ball joints and tie rods, is also a common concern as the vehicle ages. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and factor in potential repair costs for a vehicle of this age. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate more significant problems.
