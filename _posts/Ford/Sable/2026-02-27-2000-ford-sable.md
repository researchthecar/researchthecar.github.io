### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Ford Sable presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly the intake manifold gaskets and spark plug threads on the Vulcan V6, and timing chain wear on the Duratec. Automatic transmissions can experience torque converter problems and overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts are also noted for wear. Electrically, the Body Control Module and alternators can be points of failure. Exterior rust is a concern for vehicles in certain climates, and interior wear is typical for its age. Despite these potential issues, many Sables have provided reliable service with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
