The 2004 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact SUV primarily sold in emerging markets, not in North America. It was designed as an affordable and practical vehicle, based on the Ford Fiesta platform. For the 2004 model year, engine options commonly included a 1.0L or 1.6L gasoline engine, and a 1.4L diesel engine in some markets. The 1.6L gasoline engine produced around 95 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praised its affordability, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability in urban environments. Common complaints often revolved around the basic interior, limited cargo space, and somewhat underpowered engines. Given the global nature of the EcoSport and availability in emerging markets, information regarding specific issues and complaints may vary significantly depending on the region.

**Summary**

The 2004 Ford EcoSport, while generally reliable for its intended market, can suffer from issues typical of older vehicles, particularly those driven in harsh conditions. The most significant concerns appear to be related to the engines (oil consumption, injector issues) and transmission (shifting difficulty). Suspension wear, electrical glitches, and rust are also relatively common. The cost to repair these issues can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the availability of parts in a given region, but some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, while others can be quite costly.
