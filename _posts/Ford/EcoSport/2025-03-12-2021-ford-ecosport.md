The 2021 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact SUV that offers a small footprint and relatively affordable price point. It's available with two engine options: a 1.0L EcoBoost inline-3 cylinder engine producing 125 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 166 horsepower and 149 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the EcoSport's maneuverability and ease of parking in urban environments, as well as its ample cargo space for its size. Common complaints include its lackluster acceleration, fuel economy that doesn't always live up to expectations, and some concerns about overall build quality.
