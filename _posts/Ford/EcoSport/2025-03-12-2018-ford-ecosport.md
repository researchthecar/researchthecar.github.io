The 2018 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact SUV that offers a relatively affordable entry point into the SUV market. It came with two engine options: a 1.0L EcoBoost turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 125 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 166 horsepower and 149 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciate its maneuverability, compact size, and available features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. However, some common complaints include a sluggish acceleration, especially with the 1.0L engine, and a cramped rear seat.

The engine problems, particularly coolant loss in the 1.0L EcoBoost and excessive oil consumption in the 2.0L, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues can range from relatively inexpensive fluid changes to expensive rebuilds or replacements. Electrical problems, especially with the infotainment system and backup camera, are also common. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant repair bills, so a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are crucial before purchasing a used 2018 EcoSport.
