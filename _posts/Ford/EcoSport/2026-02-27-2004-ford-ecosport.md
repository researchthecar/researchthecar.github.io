### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford EcoSport generally presents a reasonable reliability record for its age and class. The powertrain (engine and transmission) options appear to be robust with no widespread critical failures reported. However, owners should be aware of potential issues with suspension components like worn bushings, which can affect ride quality and handling. The electrical system may experience alternator failures or window regulator problems. Externally, rust can be a concern on lower body panels, and internally, seat upholstery wear is common. Addressing these potential issues proactively can ensure the continued serviceability of the vehicle.
