### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ford EcoSport presents a mixed reliability profile. The petrol engines, particularly the 1.0L EcoBoost, show some susceptibility to cooling system and turbocharger issues, while the 1.5L diesel can experience DPF problems. The PowerShift automatic transmission has been noted for shuddering and rough shifting. Electrical gremlins like battery drain and infotainment glitches are also reported. However, the suspension and interior materials are generally robust. Exterior components are mostly free of widespread issues, apart from occasional headlight condensation. Overall, while not plagued by critical failures, potential buyers should be aware of these common points of concern and factor in potential repair costs, especially for the transmission and 1.0L EcoBoost engine.
