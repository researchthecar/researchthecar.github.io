The 2010 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact SUV primarily sold in emerging markets and was not officially available in North America. Therefore, information about specific issues and complaints might be limited, as data is less readily available compared to vehicles widely sold in established markets. The 2010 EcoSport, predominantly sold in South America, was based on the Ford Fiesta platform. Common engines included a 1.6L petrol engine, producing around 105 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L petrol engine offering about 145 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. A 1.4L diesel engine was also available. The EcoSport was generally liked for its compact size, affordability, and relative fuel efficiency for its class. However, it was often criticized for its basic interior, somewhat underpowered engines (especially the 1.6L), and limited safety features compared to more modern SUVs.

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford EcoSport, while practical for its compact size and affordability, presents several potential issues. Engine problems, such as misfires and coolant leaks on the 1.6L, and idle air control and oxygen sensor issues on the 2.0L, could lead to moderate repair costs. Transmission issues related to clutch wear in manual versions are common. Suspension problems, particularly worn bushings and shock absorbers, can affect ride quality and handling. Electrical issues such as power window and central locking malfunctions, along with exterior and interior concerns (rear hatch, A/C and dashboard), can further add to the overall cost of ownership. While some of these repairs are relatively inexpensive, others could potentially lead to substantial expenses, especially if multiple issues arise. Overall, a thorough inspection is essential before purchasing a used 2010 Ford EcoSport.
