The 2016 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact SUV that offered a blend of affordability and practicality for city driving. It was available with two engine options: a 1.0L EcoBoost turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 123 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque and a 2.0L four-cylinder engine that puts out 145 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the EcoSport's maneuverability, fuel efficiency (especially with the 1.0L engine), and ease of parking. However, common complaints included a lack of power, especially when fully loaded, a cramped interior, and subpar ride quality.
