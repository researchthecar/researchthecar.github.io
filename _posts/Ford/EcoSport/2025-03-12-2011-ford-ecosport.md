The 2011 Ford EcoSport, primarily sold in South American and Asian markets, is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability and fuel efficiency. Engine options typically include a 1.6L petrol engine (approximately 110 hp and 105 lb-ft of torque) and a 1.5L diesel engine. Transmission options are typically a 5-speed manual and potentially a 4-speed automatic depending on the market. Owners often appreciate its compact size for city driving and its relatively spacious interior for its class. Common complaints revolve around its basic features, limited power, and potentially dated interior design compared to newer vehicles.
