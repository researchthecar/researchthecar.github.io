### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Ford EcoSport is a budget-friendly subcompact SUV that generally performs adequately for its class. However, potential buyers should be aware of reported issues, particularly with the 1.5L engine's cooling and oil systems, and the 6-speed automatic transmission's tendency for hesitation or overheating in certain configurations. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment screen issues and battery drain, are also noted.
