The 2012 Ford EcoSport, primarily sold in markets outside of North America, is a subcompact SUV known for its fuel efficiency and compact size, making it suitable for urban environments. Engine options commonly include a 1.0L EcoBoost petrol engine (approximately 123 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque), a 1.5L petrol engine, and a 1.5L diesel engine. Transmission options are typically a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic, depending on the engine and market.
