The 2007 Ford EcoSport, primarily sold in markets outside of North America, is a compact SUV known for its affordability, practicality, and relatively nimble handling. The 2007 model year generally offered a few different engine options. These options commonly included a 1.6L Duratec petrol engine producing around 96 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L Duratec petrol engine producing around 141 horsepower and 137 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.4L Duratorq TDCi diesel engine producing around 67 horsepower and 118 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options are usually a 5-speed manual transmission and a 4-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine. Owners often appreciate the EcoSport's compact size for city driving and its fuel efficiency. On the other hand, common dislikes include the somewhat basic interior and occasionally underpowered engines, especially with a full load.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford EcoSport, while generally a reliable vehicle for its class, does have some common issues. Engine-related problems like coil pack failures and EGR valve issues appear across different engine options. The transmission can suffer from slipping gears, particularly in the automatic variant. Suspension issues such as worn bushings can affect handling. Electrical problems can manifest in the central locking system and power windows. Exterior rust and interior AC failures are also reported. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others like transmission repairs or AC compressor replacements can be more costly, potentially making them a major concern for buyers. The severity of these issues can vary widely, and proactive maintenance is crucial to prevent them.
