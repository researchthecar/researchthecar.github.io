### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford EcoSport presents a mixed reliability profile. The petrol engines, particularly the 1.0L EcoBoost, have seen reports of coolant leaks and turbocharger issues, while the 1.5L diesel can experience injector problems. The 2.0L petrol engine appears more robust. The 6-speed PowerShift automatic transmission is a notable concern, with common complaints of shuddering and potential TCM failures, making the manual transmission a potentially more reliable choice. Electrical issues, primarily related to the infotainment system and battery drain, are also present. Suspension, exterior, and interior components generally fare well with no widespread significant issues reported. Prospective buyers should carefully consider the specific engine and transmission combination and be aware of potential repair costs associated with the PowerShift gearbox.
