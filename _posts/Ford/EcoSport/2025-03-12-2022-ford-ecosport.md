The 2022 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact SUV that offers a relatively affordable entry point into the SUV market. It is only available with one engine option, a 2.0L inline-4 cylinder engine producing 166 horsepower and 149 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its small size for city maneuverability and its user-friendly infotainment system. Common criticisms include its lack of power, limited cargo space, and dated interior design.

**Engine**

**2.0L I4**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing higher than normal oil consumption in the 2.0L engine. This can manifest as the need to add oil more frequently than expected between oil changes, or low oil level warnings.
    * Solution: There is no specific fix from Ford for this issue. Regular monitoring of oil levels and topping off as needed is the most common approach. Some owners have reported success with using higher viscosity oil, but this is not a recommended solution.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Oil changes, topping off oil; engine replacement could be necessary for severe cases but is a very high cost.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifting, particularly during lower gears. This can manifest as noticeable lurching or hesitation during acceleration.
