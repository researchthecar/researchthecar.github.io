**Introduction:**

The 2006 Ford EcoSport is a compact SUV offered with a 2.0L Duratec engine and a 5-speed manual transmission. It delivers 145 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. Owners praise the EcoSport's affordability, fuel efficiency, and spacious interior, but criticize its underpowered engine and lack of features.

**Engine**

**2.0L Duratec Engine**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** Premature failure of the intake manifold gasket can lead to coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include engine overheating, decreased performance, and oil contamination. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** A faulty timing chain tensioner can cause excessive timing chain slack, leading to engine misfires, rough idling, and performance loss. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $700+
* **EGR valve failure:** Malfunction of the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve can result in reduced engine power, increased emissions, and poor fuel economy. Solution: Replace the EGR valve. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $350+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

* **Difficult shifting:** Occasional difficulties in shifting gears, particularly into reverse, have been reported. Solution: Lubricate the shifter mechanism or replace the shift linkage. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250+
* **Clutch slipping:** Excessive clutch wear can cause slipping, leading to reduced power transfer and difficulty in engaging gears. Solution: Replace the clutch assembly. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+

**Suspension**

* **Front struts failure:** Premature failure of the front struts can lead to unstable handling, excessive tire wear, and decreased ride comfort. Solution: Replace the front struts. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $600+ for a pair
* **Rear leaf springs sagging:** Over time, the rear leaf springs can weaken and sag, causing reduced load-carrying capacity and poor ride quality. Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $400+ per side
* **Sway bar end link failure:** Worn or broken sway bar end links can result in clunking noises, poor handling, and reduced stability. Solution: Replace the sway bar end links. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ per pair

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** A faulty alternator can prevent the battery from charging properly, leading to starting problems and electrical system malfunctions. Solution: Replace the alternator. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500+
* **Starter failure:** Malfunction of the starter motor can prevent the engine from starting. Symptoms include clicking sounds or no response when turning the key. Solution: Replace the starter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Battery drain:** Electrical components, such as interior lights or a faulty alternator, can drain the battery when the vehicle is parked. Solution: Identify and fix the source of the drain. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the issue

**Exterior**

* **Door handle failure:** The door handles may become loose or break, making it difficult to open the doors. Solution: Replace the door handles. Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ per handle
* **Tailgate misalignment:** The tailgate may not close or latch properly due to misalignment or worn hinges. Solution: Adjust or replace the tailgate hinges. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Interior**

* **Audio system failure:** Malfunction of the audio system, including the head unit, speakers, or amplifier, can lead to no sound, distorted sound, or other issues. Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the affected component. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the component
* **HVAC system failure:** Problems with the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, such as a faulty blower motor or clogged condenser, can result in poor temperature control or airflow. Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the affected component. Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies depending on the component

**Summary:**

The 2006 Ford EcoSport has several reported issues, particularly with its engine, transmission, and suspension. Issues with the intake manifold gasket and timing chain tensioner can be costly to repair, while clutch slipping and difficult shifting can affect drivability. Suspension component failures can compromise handling and ride quality. Electrical problems can range from minor battery drain to major alternator failure. Interior and exterior issues are relatively minor but can still affect convenience and comfort. Overall, the severity and cost of the issues with the EcoSport should be considered before purchasing a used model.
