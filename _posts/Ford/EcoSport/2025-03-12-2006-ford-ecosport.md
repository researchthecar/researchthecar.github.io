The 2006 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact SUV primarily sold in South American and other developing markets; it was never officially sold in the United States. The 2006 EcoSport came with a range of engine options, but one of the more common ones was the 2.0L Duratec inline-4 gasoline engine which produced around 143 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. This engine was typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Some owners appreciated the EcoSport for its relatively spacious interior for its size, its rugged styling and higher ride height. Common complaints included the relatively underpowered engines, ride quality, and basic interior appointments.
