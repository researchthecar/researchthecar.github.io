### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford EcoSport presents a mixed reliability profile. The 1.6L engine shows some susceptibility to coolant and oil leaks, while the 2.0L engine appears more robust. The PowerShift automatic transmission is a notable concern, with reports of shuddering and potential failure, often requiring costly repairs. Manual transmissions are generally more reliable but can experience clutch wear. Suspension components like bushings can wear over time, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical problems, particularly battery drain and alternator faults, are also documented. Interior electronics, such as the infotainment system, can occasionally exhibit glitches. Overall, while the EcoSport offers practicality, potential buyers should be aware of the specific powertrain and electrical concerns, especially regarding the automatic transmission.
