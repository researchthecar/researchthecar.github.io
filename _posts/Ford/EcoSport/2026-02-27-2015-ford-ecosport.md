### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ford EcoSport presents a mixed reliability profile. The petrol engines, particularly the 1.0L EcoBoost, have seen some reports of cooling system leaks and turbocharger issues, while the diesel and 1.5L petrol engines appear more robust. The PowerShift automatic transmission is a notable area of concern, with shuddering and rough shifting being reported. Manual transmissions are generally more reliable but subject to standard clutch wear. Electrical gremlins, especially with the infotainment system and potential battery drain, are also points to monitor. Exterior issues are minor, with the spare wheel carrier being a specific, though not universal, concern. Interior reliability is generally good, though AC performance can sometimes be an issue. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of the specific transmission and 1.0L EcoBoost engine concerns.
