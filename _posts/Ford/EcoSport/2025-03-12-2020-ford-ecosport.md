The 2020 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact SUV that offers a nimble driving experience and a relatively affordable price point. The 2020 EcoSport came standard with a 1.0L EcoBoost turbocharged inline-3 engine producing 125 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. An optional, more powerful 2.0L Ti-VCT inline-4 engine was also available, delivering 166 horsepower and 149 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the EcoSport's maneuverability in urban environments and its user-friendly infotainment system. Common criticisms include its small cargo area, somewhat underwhelming fuel economy for its class, and the base engine's lack of power.

**Engine**

**1.0L EcoBoost**

*   **Engine Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of engine hesitation, particularly during acceleration from a stop or at lower speeds. In some cases, this can lead to the engine stalling completely.
    *   Solution: In some situations, a software update to the ECU is reported to fix the stalling issues. In other cases, replacement of a faulty sensor, such as the mass airflow sensor or crankshaft position sensor, has been required. A mechanic will need to diagnose the code thrown by the vehicle and determine the cause of the hesitation/stalling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Ti-VCT**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported that the engine consumes an excessive amount of oil between oil changes. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently and blue smoke from the exhaust in some cases.
    *   Solution: There is no definitive fix for this issue. Some owners have had success with using a heavier weight oil, while others have required engine repair or replacement. Check the PCV valve and replace it if needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $40 (PCV valve) , $500+ (Engine Repair), $3,000+ (Engine Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between lower gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration and deceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission software update may alleviate the issue in some cases. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary. Check the transmission fluid level and condition. Replacing the fluid can help improve shifting smoothness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Software Update/Fluid Change), $800+ (Valve Body), $3,000+ (Transmission Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping is the delay between the engine RPM increasing and the vehicle speed actually increasing. Transmission slippage often occurs in higher gears.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission fluid can sometimes solve the transmission slipping issues. Severe cases of transmission slippage may require valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (Software Update/Fluid Change), $800+ (Valve Body), $3,000+ (Transmission Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC infotainment system is prone to freezing, crashing, or becoming unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset, updating the SYNC software to the latest version, or, in some cases, replacing the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) has been required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (System Reset/Software Update), $500+ (APIM Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera display.
    *   Solution: Inspect the camera wiring for damage. A faulty camera module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (Camera Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Poor Quality Interior Trim**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted that the interior trim and materials, such as the dashboard and door panels, feel cheap and are prone to scratching and wear.
    *   Solution: There is no real solution for this other than to replace the parts with higher quality aftermarket parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the part replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford EcoSport has some common issues, primarily revolving around the engine (oil consumption on the 2.0L, hesitation on the 1.0L) and the 6-speed transmission, which can exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical issues related to the infotainment system are also prevalent. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances like infotainment glitches to more significant concerns like engine oil consumption and potential transmission problems. Repair costs can vary widely, from relatively inexpensive software updates to potentially costly engine or transmission repairs. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any used EcoSport before purchase, checking for signs of oil consumption, transmission problems, and infotainment system malfunctions.
