The 2019 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability and maneuverability. It came with two engine options: a 1.0L EcoBoost turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 125 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L Ti-VCT four-cylinder engine making 166 horsepower and 149 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the EcoSport's compact size for city driving and its available features for the price point. Common dislikes included its relatively underpowered engines, limited cargo space, and the sometimes-criticized interior quality.

**Engine**

**1.0L EcoBoost**

*   **Coolant Loss**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant level drops rapidly, often with no visible external leaks. Can lead to overheating.
    *   Solution: Pressure test the cooling system to pinpoint the leak. Common leak points on the 1.0L EcoBoost engine include the water pump and the turbocharger coolant lines. Replace the leaking component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L Ti-VCT**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormal amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. May notice blue smoke from the exhaust, especially during start-up.
    *   Solution: Oil consumption test to confirm the issue. Investigate potential causes such as worn piston rings or valve stem seals. Depending on the source, repairs can range from valve stem seal replacement to a complete engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5000+ depending on the severity and required repair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable hard shifts between gears, often accompanied by a jerking or shuddering sensation. Can be more pronounced during low-speed driving or when shifting between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. Perform a transmission fluid flush and replace the filter. If the problem persists, further diagnostics may be needed, including checking for valve body issues or internal transmission damage. In some cases, a transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $4000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises coming from the rear suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or rough roads.
    *   Solution: Inspect rear suspension bushings for cracks, tears, or excessive play. Replace worn or damaged bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the bushings replaced and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 3 infotainment system freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes intermittently. May experience glitches with navigation, Bluetooth connectivity, or the rearview camera.
    *   Solution: First, try performing a SYNC 3 system reset through the settings menu. If the issue persists, check for software updates and install the latest version. If problems continue, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (system reset/software update) - $500+ (APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery drains quickly, especially when the car is parked for extended periods. May experience difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty modules, or a failing battery. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin through the sunroof, typically during or after rain.
    *   Solution: Inspect sunroof drain tubes for clogs or obstructions. Clean the drain tubes to allow water to flow freely. If the leaks persist, the sunroof seal may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the cause and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford EcoSport has some notable issues, especially relating to the engine (oil consumption on the 2.0L and coolant loss on the 1.0L), transmission (harsh shifting), electrical system (infotainment glitches and battery drain), and sunroof leaks. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, with engine and transmission problems potentially leading to significant repair expenses. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
