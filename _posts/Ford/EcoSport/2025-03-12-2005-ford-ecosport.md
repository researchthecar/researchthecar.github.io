The 2005 Ford EcoSport, primarily sold in markets outside North America, is a subcompact SUV known for its affordability and practicality. Available engine options typically included a 1.0L Petrol, 1.6L Petrol, and a 2.0L Petrol engine. A 1.4L Diesel Engine was also an option. The 1.6L Petrol engine, for example, produced around 95 horsepower and 104 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate its compact size for city driving and fuel efficiency. However, common dislikes include the basic interior, limited cargo space, and somewhat underpowered engines, particularly when fully loaded.
