The 2017 Ford EcoSport marked the vehicle's introduction to the North American market, although it had been available in other markets prior. It's a subcompact SUV known for its compact size, maneuverability, and relatively affordable price point. The 2017 EcoSport offered two engine options: a 1.0L EcoBoost turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 125 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.0L naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine producing 140 horsepower and 139 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the EcoSport for its easy-to-park size and available features like SYNC 3 infotainment. However, it's frequently criticized for its relatively underpowered engines, cramped rear seating, and lower-quality interior materials compared to competitors.

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford EcoSport, while offering practicality in a small package, does present some common issues. Engine problems, particularly oil consumption in the 2.0L and potential turbocharger failure in the 1.0L, can be costly. Transmission issues with harsh shifting can also arise. Electrical glitches within the SYNC 3 system are frequent, potentially requiring expensive module replacements. While not all EcoSports will experience these problems, they're common enough to warrant close inspection when considering purchasing this vehicle.
