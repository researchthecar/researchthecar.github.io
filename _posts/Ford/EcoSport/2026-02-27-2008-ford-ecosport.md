### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Ford EcoSport generally offers decent reliability for its class, especially with its manual transmission variants. The engines are typically robust.

Exterior rust can also be a concern depending on the climate. Interior components like the HVAC fan motor are also known to fail. While not plagued by widespread critical failures, these issues can add to the overall cost of ownership if not addressed proactively.
