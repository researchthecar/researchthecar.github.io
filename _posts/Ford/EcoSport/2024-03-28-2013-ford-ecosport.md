**Introduction to the 2013 Ford EcoSport**

The 2013 Ford EcoSport is a subcompact crossover SUV that slots below the Escape in the American automaker's lineup. It is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 160 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque, paired with either a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive is optional.

Despite its compact size, the EcoSport offers surprisingly spacious interior and a versatile cargo area. It also comes with a long list of standard features, including a touchscreen infotainment system, Bluetooth connectivity, and a rearview camera. However, the EcoSport has also been criticized for its lackluster performance, poor fuel economy, and cramped rear seats.
