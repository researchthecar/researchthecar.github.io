The 2014 Ford EcoSport, while not originally sold in North America, was available in other markets with a variety of engine options. This response will focus on the 1.0L EcoBoost engine option, a popular choice. This engine delivered approximately 123 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the EcoSport for its compact size and maneuverability, making it ideal for city driving. However, common dislikes include the relatively small cargo space and perceived lack of power, especially when fully loaded or driving uphill. Reliability is also a point of concern, with some owners reporting a higher frequency of repairs compared to other subcompact SUVs.
