### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Ford EcoSport demonstrates a mixed reliability profile. The 1.0L EcoBoost engine has shown some susceptibility to cooling system leaks and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission, particularly in FWD configurations, has occasionally been reported to exhibit shifting issues. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted concerns. However, the 2.0L engine and AWD transmission variants appear more robust. Suspension, exterior, and interior components generally hold up well. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues, especially when considering models with the 1.0L EcoBoost engine and FWD automatic transmission, and factor in potential repair costs.
