However, some common complaints revolve around the reliability of certain components, particularly in the earlier model years of this generation. Some owners have reported issues with the transmission, electrical systems, and engine.

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant seeping into the cylinders causing white smoke on startup, rough running, engine misfires, and potential engine damage. This is usually caused by cracks forming in the engine block.
    *   Solution: The solution is typically an engine replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.0L EcoBoost, this engine can also experience coolant intrusion into the cylinders due to cracks in the engine block. Symptoms include white smoke, rough idle, and potential engine failure.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement is generally required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $8,000+

    *   Solution: Diagnosis may involve checking the transmission fluid level and condition, as well as inspecting the transmission control module (TCM) for any error codes. In some cases, a software update or transmission flush may resolve the issue. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid check/flush) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild)

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature battery drain, often leading to difficulty starting the vehicle or requiring frequent jump starts. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from an electrical component that is not properly shutting down when the vehicle is turned off.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the parasitic drain. This may involve testing various electrical circuits and components to isolate the faulty part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
