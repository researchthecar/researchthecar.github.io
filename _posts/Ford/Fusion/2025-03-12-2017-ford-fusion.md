**Summary**

The 2017 Ford Fusion, while generally a well-regarded vehicle, can suffer from some notable issues. The most concerning are the engine problems, particularly for the 1.5L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines, where coolant intrusion can lead to severe engine damage. Transmission issues can range from minor inconveniences to major repairs. Electrical gremlins, especially regarding battery drain and the SYNC system, are also relatively common. While some issues have relatively low repair costs, the potential for major engine or transmission work makes it important for prospective buyers to have a thorough inspection performed before purchase. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely, but some problems could lead to expenses of several thousand dollars.
