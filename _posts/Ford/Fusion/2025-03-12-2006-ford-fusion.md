The 2006 Ford Fusion marked the beginning of a new era for Ford's mid-size sedan offerings. It was praised for its attractive styling, comfortable ride, and relatively sporty handling compared to its predecessor, the Taurus. However, owners have also reported issues common to the first model year of a new vehicle platform. The 2006 Fusion was available with three engine options: a 2.3L Duratec inline-4 producing 160 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L Duratec V6 producing 221 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. The 2.3L engine was paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.0L engine was paired exclusively with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some common complaints included premature brake wear, electrical glitches, and some issues with the automatic transmissions, particularly in early production models.

**Engine**

**2.3L Duratec I4**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and a possible check engine light. Often due to worn spark plugs or faulty ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replace spark plugs and/or ignition coils.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.3L engine may consume excessive amounts of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Some owners have reported needing to add oil frequently between oil changes.
    *   Solution: In some cases, replacing the PCV valve can help. More severe cases may require engine work, such as piston ring replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duratec V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced power, and poor fuel economy. The IMRC system helps optimize airflow into the engine at different RPMs. A faulty IMRC can cause performance issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the IMRC assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks originating from the thermostat housing or water pump area are common. This can lead to overheating and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the thermostat housing or water pump and associated gaskets/seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (2.3L Engine)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or complete failure. This is often due to worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid levels.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush (if the fluid is not severely burnt). If the issue persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (3.0L Engine)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at low speeds or during light acceleration. Often caused by torque converter clutch wear or fluid contamination.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush with the correct fluid type. If the shudder persists, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid flush) - $800+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, uneven tire wear, and poor handling. Ball joints, tie rod ends, and sway bar links are common failure points.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows may stop working or operate intermittently. This is often due to a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the affected window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Instrument cluster gauges (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, etc.) may fail or display incorrect readings. This is often due to a faulty instrument cluster.
    * Solution: Replace the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exterior door handles can break or become difficult to use, particularly in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Replace the door handle assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sun Visor Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sun visors may sag and not stay in the upright position.
    *   Solution: Replace the sun visors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per visor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Ford Fusion, while generally a reliable vehicle, is prone to certain issues due to its age and being a first-year model. Engine problems like misfires and oil consumption in the 2.3L and IMRC issues in the 3.0L can be costly to address. Transmission issues, particularly in the automatic variants, can range from fluid flushes to complete rebuilds. Suspension and electrical problems are also prevalent and can impact the vehicle's safety and usability. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potential repairs, especially concerning the engine, transmission, and electrical systems. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but addressing them promptly is essential to maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity.
