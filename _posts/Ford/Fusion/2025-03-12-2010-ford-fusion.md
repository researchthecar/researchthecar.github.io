The 2010 Ford Fusion was a popular mid-size sedan known for its fuel efficiency, comfortable ride, and attractive styling. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-4 cylinder, a 3.0L V6, and a 3.5L V6. The 2.5L produced 175 hp and 172 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 6-speed automatic and a 6-speed manual. Owners generally appreciated the Fusion's reliability and value, but some common complaints included issues with the transmission, particularly with rough shifting and occasional failures. Others noted problems with the electrical system and some interior components.
