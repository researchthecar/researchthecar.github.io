### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ford Fusion presents a generally reliable option in the mid-size sedan segment. While most owners experience trouble-free operation, the 1.5L and 1.6L EcoBoost engines have shown some susceptibility to coolant leaks and turbocharger issues, respectively, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit hesitation or shuddering. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. However, these issues are not universal, and many Fusions of this year perform admirably. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to any emerging symptoms are key to ensuring long-term reliability.
