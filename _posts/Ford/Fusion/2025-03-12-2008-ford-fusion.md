**Summary**

The 2008 Ford Fusion can be a decent vehicle, but it's important to be aware of potential issues. While the 2.3L I4 is fairly reliable, the 3.0L V6 can suffer from timing chain and coolant leak problems that are expensive to fix. Suspension and electrical issues are also relatively common. While some repairs are minor, others, like timing chain replacement, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any existing or potential problems.
