### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford Fusion generally presents a reliable ownership experience, particularly with its standard 2.3L engine and 5-speed automatic transmission. The 3.0L V6 is also robust. The primary areas of concern tend to be the 6-speed automatic transmission, which can exhibit shifting issues, and certain suspension components like control arm bushings and struts, which may require replacement due to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument cluster problems, are also noted but not universally prevalent. Overall, the Fusion is a solid choice for those seeking a dependable mid-size sedan, provided potential buyers are aware of and prepared for these specific, albeit not overwhelming, reliability considerations.
