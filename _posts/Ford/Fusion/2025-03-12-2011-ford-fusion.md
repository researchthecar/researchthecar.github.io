**Engine**

**2.5L Duratec I4**

*   **Throttle Body Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience rough idling, stalling, or reduced power. This is often due to a faulty throttle body, which can cause the engine to not receive the correct air-fuel mixture.
    *   Solution: Replacing the throttle body is the common fix. Some owners have also reported success cleaning the throttle body, but replacement is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L Duratec V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant leaks, and a noticeable whining noise from the engine. The water pump is prone to failure, leading to coolant loss and potential engine damage if not addressed promptly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the water pump is the required fix. It is advisable to replace the timing belt while the engine is disassembled.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter or transmission rebuild may be necessary. A fluid flush *may* help in some cases, but the issue typically returns.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on whether torque converter or full rebuild is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2011 Ford Fusion, while generally a reliable and comfortable vehicle, does have some common issues to be aware of. The most significant concerns revolve around the 3.0L Duratec V6 engine with water pump failures and the 6-speed automatic transmission torque converter. Suspension and electrical issues are also present. While some repairs, like throttle body cleaning or a SYNC software update, may be inexpensive, others, such as torque converter replacement or water pump repairs, can be relatively costly. Prospective buyers should be mindful of these potential problems and carefully inspect the vehicle before purchase, especially the transmission's performance and the engine's cooling system.
