### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford Fusion offers a generally competent package, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The Duratec engines, particularly the V6, can experience costly spark plug blowout and VVT problems. Automatic transmissions may develop shifting issues or leaks over time. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are also known to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty window regulators and instrument clusters, can add to repair bills. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, these specific areas represent the most likely sources of repair for a 2006 Fusion. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for maximizing its lifespan and reliability.
