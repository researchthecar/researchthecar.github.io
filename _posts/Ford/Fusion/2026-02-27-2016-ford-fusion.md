### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford Fusion presents a generally reliable profile, particularly with its naturally aspirated and hybrid powertrains. The turbocharged EcoBoost engines, while offering good performance, have shown some susceptibility to issues like coolant control valve leaks and turbocharger problems, which can incur moderate repair costs. The automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Overall, the Fusion is a solid choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas, especially when considering models with the turbocharged engines or higher mileage.
