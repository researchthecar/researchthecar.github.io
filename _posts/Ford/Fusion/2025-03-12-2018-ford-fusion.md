**Summary**

The 2018 Ford Fusion presents a mixed bag of potential issues. The most concerning and potentially expensive are engine-related problems, particularly coolant intrusion and turbocharger failure in the 1.5L and 2.0L EcoBoost engines. The transmission issues are also a point of concern. Electrical and interior issues, while less severe, can be annoying. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work, so careful inspection and maintenance are crucial.
