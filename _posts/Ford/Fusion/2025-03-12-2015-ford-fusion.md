Suspension knuckle failures can be very dangerous, so that recall should definitely be addressed on the vehicle. The 6F35 transmission can cause erratic or harsh shifting. Other electrical issues such as the door latch problems and the issues with the MyFord touch system can also be frustrating. Repair costs range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission repairs.
