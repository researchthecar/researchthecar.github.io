The 2014 Ford Fusion marked the second year of the second-generation model, offering a stylish design and a range of fuel-efficient engine options. Available engines included a 2.5L Duratec I4 (175 hp, 175 lb-ft of torque), a 1.5L EcoBoost I4 (181 hp, 185 lb-ft of torque), a 1.6L EcoBoost I4 (178 hp, 184 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 (240 hp, 270 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were primarily a 6-speed automatic, though some earlier models might have a 6-speed manual. Owners generally praised the Fusion for its comfortable ride, attractive interior, and good fuel economy, but common complaints included electrical issues, transmission problems (especially with the 6F35 transmission), and some engine concerns depending on the specific engine.

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Fusion offers a stylish and fuel-efficient option, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 1.5L and 1.6L EcoBoost engines, can lead to costly repairs. Transmission issues with the 6F35 are also prevalent. Electrical problems with the MyFord Touch system are a common frustration. While not all Fusions will experience these problems, a thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate inconvenience (electrical glitches) to potentially severe engine or transmission damage, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the problem.
