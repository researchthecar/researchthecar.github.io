The 2016 Ford Fusion is a mid-size sedan known for its stylish design, comfortable ride, and available hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains. Common engine options include the 2.5L Duratec I4 (175 hp, 175 lb-ft torque), the 1.5L EcoBoost I4 (181 hp, 185 lb-ft torque), the 2.0L EcoBoost I4 (240 hp, 270 lb-ft torque), and a hybrid 2.0L Atkinson-cycle I4. Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic for the gasoline engines and an eCVT for the hybrid models. People generally appreciate the Fusion's fuel efficiency, handling, and interior design. Some common dislikes include the MyFord Touch infotainment system (although it was upgraded to SYNC 3 for later models) and reported reliability issues.

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford Fusion is a generally reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of certain common issues. The 1.5L EcoBoost engine, in particular, has a known issue with coolant intrusion which can be a very costly repair. Other issues, like turbocharger failures and transmission problems, can also result in significant repair bills. Electrical problems with the SYNC system and battery drain can be frustrating. While the door latch recall is a known issue, it only covers specific model years and a limited range of production dates. Carefully inspect any used 2016 Fusion for these potential problems before purchasing.
