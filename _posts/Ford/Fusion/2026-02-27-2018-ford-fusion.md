### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Ford Fusion generally demonstrates good reliability across its various configurations. The naturally aspirated 2.5L engine and the hybrid powertrains are particularly noted for their robustness. While the EcoBoost engines can be efficient, the 1.5L variant has seen some reports of coolant leaks, and the 2.0L EcoBoost may experience turbocharger issues. Transmission concerns are infrequent but can manifest as hesitation or shuddering in the automatic units. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are the most commonly cited non-routine issues. Overall, the Fusion is a dependable choice, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine and electrical system considerations.
