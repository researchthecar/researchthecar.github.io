### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Ford Fusion generally presents a solid reliability record, particularly with its naturally aspirated and hybrid powertrains. The EcoBoost engines, while offering good performance, have seen some reports of coolant leaks from the control valve and potential turbocharger issues, which are not uncommon for turbocharged engines. Automatic transmission issues, such as hesitation or shuddering, are also noted and may require fluid services or more involved repairs. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are present but often resolvable with software updates or component diagnosis. Overall, the Fusion is a dependable choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas, especially when considering models with the 1.5L or 2.0L EcoBoost engines and the automatic transmission.
