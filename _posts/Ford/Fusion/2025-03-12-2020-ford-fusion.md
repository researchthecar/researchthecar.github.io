The 2020 Ford Fusion is a mid-size sedan that offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and a range of engine options. While discontinued after 2020, it remains a popular choice in the used car market. Engine options for the 2020 Fusion include a 1.5L EcoBoost I4 (181 hp, 185 lb-ft torque), a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 (245 hp, 275 lb-ft torque), and a 2.5L Duratec I4 (175 hp, 175 lb-ft torque). It also was offered as a hybrid with a 2.0L I4 engine, and as a plug-in hybrid named the Fusion Energi. The gasoline engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Fusion's fuel efficiency, quiet cabin, and user-friendly technology. Common dislikes include its somewhat bland styling (relative to competitors) and the lack of significant updates in its final years.

Other issues, such as transmission harshness and infotainment glitches, are less severe and often addressable with software updates or relatively minor repairs.
