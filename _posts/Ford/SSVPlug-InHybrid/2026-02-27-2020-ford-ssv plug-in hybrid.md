# 2020 Ford SSV Plug-In Hybrid

### Overview
The 2020 Ford SSV Plug-In Hybrid, while a capable vehicle, presents a mixed reliability profile based on available data. As a relatively new model in the plug-in hybrid segment for Ford, some components, particularly those related to the advanced powertrain, have shown areas for improvement. The integration of electric and internal combustion systems requires sophisticated management, which can sometimes lead to specific electronic or battery-related concerns. However, the core mechanical aspects of the vehicle, when properly maintained, generally perform well. This analysis focuses on documented technical issues beyond routine maintenance, aiming to provide a clear picture for potential owners and fleet managers.

### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Ford SSV Plug-In Hybrid demonstrates solid performance in its conventional mechanical systems like suspension. However, the complexity of its hybrid powertrain introduces potential reliability concerns, primarily related to the hybrid system control module, battery cooling, and the high-voltage battery pack itself. Electrical issues, particularly with the infotainment system, are also noted. While the eCVT transmission is generally robust, software glitches can occur. Owners should be aware of the potential for battery degradation over time and ensure regular software updates for optimal performance and longevity. Fleet management should factor in potential costs associated with hybrid-specific component repairs or replacements.
