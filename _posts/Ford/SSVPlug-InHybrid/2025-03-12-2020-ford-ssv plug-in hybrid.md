The 2020 Ford Police Interceptor Utility Plug-In Hybrid (SSV Plug-In Hybrid) is a unique vehicle specifically designed for law enforcement use. Its primary advantage is its fuel efficiency, achieved through a plug-in hybrid powertrain. It allows for extended periods of electric-only operation, saving fuel and reducing emissions. The standard engine for the 2020 Ford Police Interceptor Utility Plug-In Hybrid is a 3.3L V6 Hybrid engine which produces around 310 horsepower. While offering cost savings on fuel, some owners reported issues with the hybrid system itself. Common complaints included concerns about the long-term reliability of the hybrid components and occasional issues with the hybrid system's software.

**Electric Motor**

**3.3L V6 Hybrid**
*   **Reduced EV Range or Complete Loss of EV Mode**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a significant decrease in the electric-only range, or the vehicle stops operating in EV mode altogether. This is often accompanied by warning lights on the dashboard related to the hybrid system.
    *   Solution: The issue often stems from a faulty hybrid battery pack or individual modules within the battery pack failing. Replacement of the faulty modules or the entire battery pack is required. Sometimes, a software update to the hybrid control module can resolve software related issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $5,000 - $10,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hybrid System Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) Illumination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates with codes specifically related to the hybrid powertrain. Symptoms may include reduced power, rough idling, or abnormal charging behavior. Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) such as P0A0D (Hybrid Battery Pack Over Temperature) or P0AFA (Hybrid Battery System Voltage Imbalance) are common.
    *   Solution: Requires diagnosis by a qualified technician using Ford diagnostic equipment to pinpoint the specific failed component (e.g., hybrid battery pack, inverter, motor generator). Repair or replacement of the faulty component and a recalibration of the PCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $8,000+ (depending on the faulty component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh shifts, particularly between 1st and 3rd gear, or a noticeable delay in gear engagement. The transmission may clunk loudly during these shifts.
    *   Solution: This may be caused by a faulty valve body. Replacement of the valve body can be complex and requires specialized tools and knowledge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine RPM increases without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. This indicates that the transmission is not properly engaging the gears, which can be a serious safety concern.
    *   Solution: This can often be caused by a faulty torque converter or worn clutch packs within the transmission. A complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Intermittent Loss of Power to Accessories**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio, interior lights, or other electrical accessories may randomly turn off or become inoperative. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: This is often caused by a loose or corroded ground connection or a faulty body control module (BCM). Check and clean all ground connections. The BCM may need to be reprogrammed or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The vehicle's battery is frequently dead or requires a jump start, even after short periods of inactivity.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the battery drain. Common culprits include faulty door latch sensors, malfunctioning modules that are not shutting down properly, or a defective alternator. Repair or replace the offending component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Upholstery Wear and Tear (Heavy Duty Cloth Seats)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and tear of the heavy duty cloth seats used specifically for law enforcement.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the worn upholstery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 per seat for repair; $200-$600 per seat for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2020 Ford Police Interceptor Utility Plug-In Hybrid, while designed for fuel efficiency and specialized use, exhibits some issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the hybrid system's reliability, particularly regarding the battery pack and its impact on EV range. These repairs can be quite costly. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, are also a concern, and electrical problems can be frustrating and require careful diagnosis. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of the potential for significant repair costs, especially related to the hybrid system and transmission, and should factor this into their purchasing decision.
