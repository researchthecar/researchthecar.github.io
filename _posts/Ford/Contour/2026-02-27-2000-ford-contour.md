## Engine

### 2.0L Zetec DOHC I4
**Head Gasket Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, engine overheating, milky oil.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the head gasket and potentially resurfacing of the cylinder head.
- **Cost:** $800 - $1500

**Intake Manifold Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Vacuum leaks, rough idle, check engine light (P0171, P0174 codes).
- **Solution:** Replacement of the intake manifold gaskets or the manifold itself.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600


### 2.5L Duratec V6
**Timing Belt Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Sudden engine shutdown, no start, potential internal engine damage (bent valves).
- **Solution:** Replacement of the timing belt, tensioners, and idler pulleys. If damage occurred, engine repair or replacement is needed.
- **Cost:** $600 - $1200 (without damage), $2000+ (with damage)

**Oil Leaks (Valve Covers/Oil Pan)**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil drips, burning oil smell, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Replacement of valve cover gaskets or oil pan gasket.
- **Cost:** $250 - $500


## Transmission

### 5-Speed Manual (MTX-75)
**Clutch Wear**
- **Symptoms:** Slipping clutch, difficulty shifting gears, burning smell.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the clutch kit (disc, pressure plate, release bearing).
- **Cost:** $600 - $1000


### 4-Speed Automatic (AX4S/AX4N)
**Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, slipping between gears, rough shifts, transmission warning light.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or full transmission rebuild/replacement.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800 (fluid/filter/solenoid), $1800 - $3500 (rebuild/replacement)


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Control Arm Bushings**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering feel, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of front lower control arms or individual bushings.
- **Cost:** $300 - $600

**Strut Mount Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Popping or creaking noises when turning, especially at low speeds.
- **Solution:** Replacement of strut mounts.
- **Cost:** $200 - $400


## Electrical

### General Electrical System
**Window Regulator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Power windows not operating, window falling into the door.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the window regulator mechanism.

### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Ford Contour presents a mixed reliability profile. The engines, particularly the 2.0L Zetec, are prone to head gasket issues and intake manifold leaks, while the 2.5L Duratec can suffer from timing belt failures if not maintained. Automatic transmissions may develop slipping or harsh shifting issues over time. Suspension components like control arm bushings and strut mounts are common wear items that can lead to noise and handling problems. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and instrument cluster faults, are also noted. While the exterior and interior are generally robust, specific components like the HVAC blower motor and door lock actuators can fail. Regular maintenance, especially for the timing belt on the V6, is crucial for mitigating some of these potential problems.
