The 2000 Ford Contour was a compact sedan offered by Ford, intended to be a more European-inspired offering compared to other American sedans. Engine choices included a 2.0L Zetec inline-4 producing 125 hp and 130 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L Duratec V6 producing 170 hp and 165 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic, depending on the engine. Owners often appreciate the Contour for its sporty handling and relatively fuel-efficient engines. Common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly with some of the car's components and the availability of parts.

**Engine**

**2.0L Zetec Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can occur from various locations on the Zetec engine, including the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal. Properly clean the area before installing the new part.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **PCV Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The PCV valve can become clogged or fail, leading to increased oil consumption, rough idling, and potentially damaged seals due to increased crankcase pressure.
    *   Solution: Replace the PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $50+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Duratec V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold gaskets on the Duratec V6 can leak, leading to vacuum leaks, rough idling, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are a common problem on the Duratec V6. These can occur at the thermostat housing, water pump, or radiator hoses. Symptoms include visible coolant leaks, overheating, and low coolant levels.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. Replace the affected part (thermostat housing, water pump, hose) and ensure a proper seal.

**Summary**

The 2000 Ford Contour can be a decent car to own, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues that can arise. Engine oil and coolant leaks, transmission issues, and suspension component failures are prevalent. The severity and cost of these issues can range from minor repairs costing under $100 to more significant repairs that can exceed $1000. Rust is also a major concern. Thorough inspection and a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic are recommended.
