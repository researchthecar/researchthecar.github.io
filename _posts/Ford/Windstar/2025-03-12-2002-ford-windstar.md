The 2002 Ford Windstar was a popular minivan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and family-friendly features. It was available with two engine options: a 3.0L Vulcan V6 producing approximately 150 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L Essex V6, which was the more common choice, delivering around 200 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Windstar's practicality and cargo capacity, but common complaints centered around reliability issues, particularly with the transmission and some electrical components.

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford Windstar, while spacious and practical, is prone to a number of reliability issues. Engine problems like head gasket failures (3.8L) and intake manifold leaks (3.0L) can be costly to repair. The 4-speed automatic transmission is a known weak point, with slipping and harsh shifting being common complaints. Electrical issues such as power door lock and window motor failures are also frequent. Suspension problems like sagging leaf springs affect ride quality. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission rebuilds or extensive rust repair, can be significant expenses. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
