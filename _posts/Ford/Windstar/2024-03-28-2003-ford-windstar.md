**Introduction: 2003 Ford Windstar**

The 2003 Ford Windstar is a minivan offered with a 3.8L V6 engine paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. It delivers 200 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque. The Windstar is known for its spacious interior, comfortable seats, and reliable performance. However, it has also received criticism for its lack of modern features and poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**3.8L V6**

* **Faulty Intake Manifold Bolts:** The intake manifold bolts can loosen over time, causing a vacuum leak. This can lead to rough idling, stalling, and decreased power. Fix: Replacing the intake manifold bolts typically costs around $150 - $300.
* **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Failure:** The EGR valve can fail, leading to increased emissions and decreased engine performance. Fix: Replacing the EGR valve and cleaning the related components can cost between $350 - $700.
* **Timing Chain Issues:** Timing chain problems have been reported in some Windstar models. Failure can cause major engine damage. Fix: Replacing the timing chain and related components can be a costly repair, ranging from $1200 - $2000.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic**

* **Shift Solenoid Malfunctions:** Shift solenoids can fail, resulting in delayed or hard shifting, slipping, and eventually transmission failure. Fix: Replacing shift solenoids can cost between $200 - $600, depending on the number of solenoids needing replacement.
* **Transmission Filter Clogging:** The transmission filter can become clogged with debris, restricting fluid flow. This can lead to transmission overheating, shuddering, and eventual failure. Fix: Replacing the transmission filter and changing the fluid costs around $150 - $300.

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Mount Wear:** Strut mounts can wear out, leading to a clunking or rattling noise on bumps. Fix: Replacing the strut mounts costs approximately $200 - $400, including labor.
* **Rear Shock Absorber Failure:** Rear shock absorbers can fail, causing a bouncy ride and poor handling. Fix: Replacing rear shock absorbers typically costs $150 - $300.

**Electrical**

* **Electrical Short in Rear Wiring Harness:** A short in the rear wiring harness can affect various electrical components, such as tail lights, backup camera, and sensors. Fix: Repairing or replacing the affected wiring can cost between $250 - $500.
* **Faulty Instrument Cluster:** The instrument cluster can malfunction, causing gauges or warning lights to fail. Fix: Replacing the instrument cluster typically costs around $400 - $800.

**Exterior**

* **Tailgate Hinge Failure:** The tailgate hinges can weaken over time, leading to the tailgate sagging or not opening properly. Fix: Replacing the tailgate hinges costs approximately $200 - $400 per hinge.

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard can develop cracks over time, especially in hot climates. Fix: Replacing the dashboard panel can cost around $500 - $1,000.
* **Power Window Motor Failure:** Power window motors can fail, causing windows to become stuck or inoperable. Fix: Replacing a power window motor typically costs between $150 - $350 per window.

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford Windstar has several potential issues, including intake manifold bolts, timing chain problems, shift solenoid malfunctions, and electrical shorts. While some issues may be minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be costly and require major repairs. Before purchasing a used Windstar, it's important to have it thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic to assess its condition and potential expenses.
