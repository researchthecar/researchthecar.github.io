### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford Windstar, while offering practicality, is known for some significant reliability concerns, particularly with its V6 engines and automatic transmissions. Common issues like intake manifold gasket leaks and head gasket failures on both the 3.0L and 3.8L engines can lead to costly repairs. The AX4N/AX4S transmission is also prone to torque converter and overheating problems. Suspension components such as ball joints and springs can wear out, and electrical gremlins, especially with the instrument cluster and power accessories, are not uncommon. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior trim may show signs of wear. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and budget for potential repairs.
