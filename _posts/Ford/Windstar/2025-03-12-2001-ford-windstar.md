The 2001 Ford Windstar was a popular minivan known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. It offered a practical solution for families needing ample passenger and cargo space. However, like any vehicle, it had its share of issues. The 2001 Windstar came with two engine options: a 3.0L Vulcan V6 producing around 150 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L Essex V6 producing approximately 200 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Windstar's interior space and affordability. Common complaints included reliability issues, particularly with the transmission and some electrical components, as well as premature rusting.

**Summary**

The 2001 Ford Windstar is prone to several issues, ranging from moderate to severe. Engine problems like intake manifold gasket leaks and coolant leaks are common for both engine options. Transmission issues, particularly with slipping and harsh shifting, can be costly to repair. Suspension problems like sagging coil springs and strut mount failure are also prevalent. Electrical issues with power doors and window motors add to the ownership costs. Rust, particularly in the rocker panels and wheel wells, is a significant concern in areas with road salt. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and be prepared for potential repair costs.
