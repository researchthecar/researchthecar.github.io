The 2000 Ford Windstar was a popular minivan offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior, appreciated by families for its practicality. Engine options included the 3.0L Vulcan V6 producing 150 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque, and the more powerful 3.8L Essex V6, generating 200 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
