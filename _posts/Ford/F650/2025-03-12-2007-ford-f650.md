**Summary**

The 2007 Ford F650, while a robust and capable truck, can suffer from several issues common to medium-duty vehicles. Engine issues with both the Caterpillar C7 and Cummins ISB can be costly due to injector problems, turbocharger failures, and other component malfunctions. Transmission issues, particularly with the Allison transmissions, can also lead to significant repair expenses. Suspension, electrical, and interior problems, while generally less expensive than major engine or transmission repairs, can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Rust is a significant concern, particularly in regions with harsh winter climates. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in the cost of potential repairs when considering a 2007 Ford F650.
