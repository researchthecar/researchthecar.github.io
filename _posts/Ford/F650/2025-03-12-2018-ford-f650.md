**Summary**

The 2018 Ford F-650, while a capable work truck, can experience a range of issues. The most common problems revolve around the engine (fuel injectors, DPF for the diesel, and spark plugs for the gas), transmission (harsh shifting, torque converter), and suspension (leaf springs, shocks). Electrical gremlins related to sensors and battery drain also surface. Corrosion is a concern, particularly in areas prone to road salt. The severity and cost of these issues vary greatly, with some minor fixes costing a few hundred dollars, while major repairs like engine or transmission replacements can run into the thousands. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and thoroughly check for these common problems before purchase.
