The 2009 Ford F650 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial purposes. It's known for its robust build and towing capacity, making it a popular choice for businesses requiring a heavy-duty work truck. Engine options include a Cummins ISB 6.7L diesel engine producing around 325-360 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque and a Caterpillar C7 engine producing up to 300 horsepower and 860 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include manual and automatic transmissions, typically Allison models. Owners appreciate the truck's durability and capability, but common complaints often revolve around higher running costs, challenging maneuverability due to its size, and the complexity of maintaining heavy-duty diesel engines.

**Engine**

**Cummins ISB 6.7L Diesel**

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, white smoke from exhaust, poor fuel economy, and potential cylinder misfires. Can lead to damage to pistons and cylinder walls if left unresolved.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors. Recalibrate the ECM after installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replace the fuel lift pump. Consider upgrading to an aftermarket pump for improved reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+, depending on the pump and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Caterpillar C7 Diesel**

*   **HEUI (Hydraulically Actuated Electronically Controlled Unit Injector) Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, low power, rough idle, engine stalling, and black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the HEUI pump. Ensure proper oil levels and maintenance intervals to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+, including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, white smoke, poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per injector, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison Automatic Transmissions (Specific Model Dependent, but Common Issues Across Aisin 1000/2000/3000 Series)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping between gears, overheating transmission, and a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Inspect the transmission for any damage caused by the failure and repair or replace as necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+, including torque converter replacement and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, hard shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, and transmission getting stuck in a single gear.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s). Inspect the wiring harness for damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+, depending on the number of solenoids replaced and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging rear end, rough ride, clunking noises, and compromised load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken or worn leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs for increased capacity and durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+, depending on the type of springs and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, including lights flickering, gauges malfunctioning, and difficulty starting. Corrosion in the harness is a common cause.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair damaged wiring. Clean corroded connections and use dielectric grease to prevent future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+, depending on the extent of the damage and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming lights, slow cranking, and a dead battery.

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford F650, while a powerful and capable truck, is prone to certain issues, particularly relating to its diesel engines and transmission. Injector and HEUI pump failures on the engine side, and torque converter and shift solenoid issues on the transmission side, are common and can be costly to repair. Suspension issues such as leaf spring failure can also affect the truck's ride quality and load-carrying capability. Electrical issues, though less frequent, can be challenging to diagnose and repair. The severity of these issues ranges from moderate to severe, and the cost of repairs can be significant, particularly for engine and transmission work. Potential buyers should factor these maintenance costs into their purchasing decision and consider a thorough inspection before buying.
