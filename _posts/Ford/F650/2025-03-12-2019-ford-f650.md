The 2019 Ford F650 is a medium-duty truck designed for commercial applications, prioritizing capability and durability. Engine options for this model year include a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine producing 270-330 horsepower and 700-750 lb-ft of torque (depending on the specific tune) and a 7.3L gas V8 producing 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are generally paired with a Ford TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the F650's robust construction, high towing capacity, and commanding presence. However, some dislike its size, challenging maneuverability in urban environments, and relatively high operational costs.
