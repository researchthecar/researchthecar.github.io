### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Ford F650 is a capable commercial vehicle, but like any heavy-duty truck, it requires diligent maintenance. The diesel engines, particularly the Caterpillar C7 and Power Stroke variants, can experience issues with fuel injectors, EGR coolers, and turbochargers, which are often costly to repair. Transmission reliability is generally good with Allison units, though torque converter and fluid leak issues can arise. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, are subject to wear and potential breakage under heavy loads. Electrical system issues like alternator failure and wiring problems are also noted. Exterior corrosion can be a significant concern depending on the operating environment. Interior components, such as the HVAC system, may require attention. Overall, the F650's reliability is heavily influenced by its specific configuration, maintenance history, and the severity of its operational duties.
