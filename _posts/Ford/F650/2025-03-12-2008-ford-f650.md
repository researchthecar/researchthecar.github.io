**Summary**

The 2008 Ford F650, while a workhorse, presents several common issues. The Cummins ISB 6.7L engine is prone to injector and EGR cooler failures, and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. The Allison automatic transmission can experience torque converter and shift solenoid malfunctions, also resulting in significant repair expenses. Suspension issues like leaf spring sagging and worn shocks affect ride quality and handling. Electrical problems stem from wiring harness issues and sensor failures. Exterior rust and interior HVAC and instrument cluster problems can further add to the maintenance burden. Overall, while the F650 offers substantial capability, potential owners should be aware of these issues that can lead to moderately severe and potentially expensive repairs.
