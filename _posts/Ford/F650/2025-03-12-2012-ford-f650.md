**Engine**

**6.7L Cummins ISB Inline-6 Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, whistling noise from the turbocharger. Can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. Inspect oil lines and air intake system for potential causes of failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, reduced fuel economy, excessive white smoke. May be caused by contaminated fuel or injector wear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty injector(s). Replacement of the affected injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+ (depending on the number of injectors and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, poor fuel economy, and the check engine light illuminates. The EGR valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve. Cleaning the EGR cooler may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10 Gasoline**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: Removal of the broken spark plug, then repair of the spark plug threads and replacing the faulty plugs with new ones.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Allison 5/6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shift Flare/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission hesitates or slips between shifts, often more noticeable under heavy load. Can be caused by worn clutch packs, valve body issues, or low fluid level.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service. If the problem persists, the transmission may require a rebuild, valve body replacement, or replacement of clutch packs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (transmission service) - $5,000+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling, or complete failure to move. The torque converter may be damaged or worn.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Inspect the transmission fluid for contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, poor ride quality, especially when loaded.  Leaf springs can sag over time or break due to stress.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected leaf spring(s). Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs for increased load capacity and durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per spring (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**

    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific wiring issue and repair or replace the affected section of the harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, poor engine performance, or malfunctioning systems. Common sensor failures include the mass airflow (MAF) sensor, oxygen (O2) sensors, and coolant temperature sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor(s). Replacement of the affected sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor (including labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found
