### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford F650, particularly with its diesel engine options, is generally a reliable work truck. However, common issues tend to center around the powertrain, specifically fuel injectors, EGR systems, turbochargers, and head gaskets for certain engine variants. Transmission issues, especially with torque converters and solenoids in automatics, and clutch wear in manuals, are also noted. Suspension components like leaf springs can experience wear and breakage under heavy use. Electrical components such as alternators and starters are typical wear items for heavy-duty vehicles. Exterior and interior components show fewer widespread technical issues. Proactive maintenance and addressing early symptoms are key to maintaining the F650's operational efficiency and longevity.
