### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford F650, while built for rugged use, presents a mixed reliability profile. The Caterpillar C7 and Cummins ISB engines are generally considered more robust than the 6.0L Power Stroke, which is known for several significant potential issues like EGR and head stud failures. Automatic transmissions, particularly the Allison series, can suffer from overheating and internal component wear, while manual transmissions may experience clutch and synchronizer issues. Suspension components like leaf springs are subject to heavy-duty wear, and electrical gremlins, especially wiring harness problems and ECM failures, can be costly. Exterior rust is a concern in corrosive environments. Overall, careful selection of engine and transmission, coupled with diligent maintenance, is key to maximizing the reliability of a 2006 F650.
