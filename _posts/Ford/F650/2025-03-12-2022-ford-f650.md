The 2022 Ford F-650 is a medium-duty commercial truck known for its robustness and versatility. Engine options include a 7.3L V8 gas engine producing 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine available in multiple power ratings, up to 330 horsepower and 950 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission is a Ford TorqShift 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the F-650's capabilities for heavy-duty work, its spacious cab, and its solid chassis. Common dislikes include its size, which makes it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and its relatively high running costs.

**Engine**

**7.3L V8 Gas Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Symptoms may include a burning oil smell or visible smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels regularly and address any leaks or signs of excessive consumption promptly. A dealership inspection may be needed to determine the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel Engine**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, reduced power, and black smoke from the exhaust can indicate a failing fuel injector.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive turbocharger noise (whining or whistling), and diagnostic trouble codes related to turbocharger performance.
    *   Solution: Inspect the turbocharger for leaks, damage, or wear. Repair or replace the turbocharger as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. A software update or recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM) may be necessary. In some cases, valve body replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid check) - $2,000+ (valve body replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, or the transmission shifts erratically.
    *   Solution: This can be caused by low fluid levels, worn clutches, or a faulty torque converter. Inspection of the transmission is required to determine the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $5,000+ (transmission replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noises, sagging suspension, or rough ride quality. This can be due to worn or broken leaf springs, bushings, or shackles.
    *   Solution: Inspect the leaf springs, bushings, and shackles for wear or damage. Replace worn or broken components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ per spring, plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) related to various sensors (e.g., ABS, TPMS, engine sensors). Symptoms can vary depending on the affected sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the sensor and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period of time, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Repair or replace the faulty component causing the draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust Issues (Frame)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Treat rust with rust inhibitor, or have a body shop apply a rust proofing undercoat to reduce rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ depending on the amount of rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning or heating system blows warm air, cold air, or has limited airflow. This can be caused by a faulty blend door actuator, compressor, or refrigerant leak.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the HVAC system and repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the component.
