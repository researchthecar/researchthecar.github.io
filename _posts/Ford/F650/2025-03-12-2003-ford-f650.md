**Summary**

The 2003 Ford F650 is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly those related to the Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine (if equipped) and the Allison transmissions. Engine issues such as injector and HEUI pump failures can be costly. Suspension and electrical problems, like leaf spring issues and wiring harness damage, are also common. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be quite severe and costly, potentially running into the thousands of dollars. Regular maintenance and inspections are crucial for mitigating these risks.
