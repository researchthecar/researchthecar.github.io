Here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2017 Ford F-650, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration. The 2017 Ford F-650 is a medium-duty truck popular for its robust build and versatility. The 2017 model year offered a choice of engines, including the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel and the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel produced around 270-330 horsepower and 700-750 lb-ft of torque. Many owners appreciate the truck's towing capacity and reliability, while some dislike its fuel economy and large size, making it difficult to maneuver in urban environments. Both engines are paired with a Ford TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission.
