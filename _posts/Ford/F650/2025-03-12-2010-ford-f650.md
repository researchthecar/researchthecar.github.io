**Summary**

The 2010 Ford F650, while a capable and durable vehicle, can present owners with a range of issues. The most significant problems tend to revolve around the Cummins diesel engine (turbo, injectors, EGR) and the Allison transmission (slipping, torque converter), leading to potentially high repair costs. Suspension and electrical issues are also common and can add to the overall maintenance expenses. Rust is a concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. While most issues are not catastrophic, the cost of repairs can be significant, reflecting the commercial-grade nature of the vehicle. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potentially high maintenance costs.
