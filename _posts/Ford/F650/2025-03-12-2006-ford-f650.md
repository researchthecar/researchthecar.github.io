The 2006 Ford F650 is a medium-duty truck often used for commercial applications. For the 2006 model year, it came equipped with a Caterpillar C7 inline-six diesel engine. Engine options included various horsepower ratings, generally ranging from 210 to 330 horsepower and torques ranging from 520-860 lb-ft. Transmission options are typically either a manual or automatic Allison transmission. Owners appreciate the F650 for its ruggedness, towing capacity, and overall capability, but dislike its size (making it difficult to maneuver and park), fuel consumption, and potential for expensive repairs due to its commercial-grade components.

**Summary:**

The 2006 Ford F650, while a capable and durable truck, is prone to issues common in medium-duty vehicles. The Caterpillar C7 engine can experience injector and head gasket failures that can be expensive. Issues with the Allison transmission, particularly shifting problems, are also noted. Suspension and electrical problems can add to the overall cost of ownership. The severity and cost of repairs for the F650 can vary greatly, depending on the issue and the extent of the damage. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the truck's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic to assess its overall condition and identify any potential problems.
