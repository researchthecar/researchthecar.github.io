### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Ford Transit Courier demonstrates a solid reliability record, particularly for its intended commercial use. The EcoBlue diesel engines, while generally robust, can occasionally encounter issues with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve, common to modern diesel technology. These are typically manageable with proper maintenance and timely servicing. The manual transmission is a strong point, with no significant reported faults. Suspension components, like bushings and ball joints, may require attention over time due to the nature of commercial use. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches or battery drain, are infrequent but possible. Overall, the Transit Courier is a dependable option, with most potential issues being repairable and not indicative of fundamental design flaws.
