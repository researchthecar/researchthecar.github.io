**Summary**

The 2002 Ford E-350 Econoline Club Wagon is generally a reliable van, but owners should be aware of potential issues like spark plug blowouts (especially on the Triton V8 and V10 engines), transmission problems, and rust. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive (e.g., replacing the CPS or IAC valve), others, like spark plug thread repair, transmission rebuilds, and rust remediation, can be quite costly. Regular maintenance and addressing problems early can help extend the life of the vehicle and prevent more expensive repairs down the road.
