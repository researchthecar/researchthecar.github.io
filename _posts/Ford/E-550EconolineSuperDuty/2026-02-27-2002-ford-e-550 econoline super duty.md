### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford E-550 Econoline Super Duty is a workhorse vehicle that, while generally robust, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and heavy-duty application. The gasoline V8 engines (5.4L and 6.8L) are prone to spark plug blowout and intake manifold leaks, while the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel requires vigilance for EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head gasket failures. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4R100, often involve the torque converter or solenoid pack. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear. Electrical gremlins can arise from connector corrosion, and the exterior may show signs of rust. Interior wear, especially on the driver's seat, and HVAC blower motor failures are also noted. Regular maintenance and proactive addressing of these potential issues are key to maintaining the reliability of this commercial van.
