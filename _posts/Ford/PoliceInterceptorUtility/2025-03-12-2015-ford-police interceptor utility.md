The 2015 Ford Police Interceptor Utility, based on the Ford Explorer, is a popular choice for law enforcement agencies due to its spacious interior, robust build, and available all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing around 304 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 generating approximately 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Common praises include its practicality and durability, while complaints often revolve around maintenance costs, fuel economy, and some reported reliability issues, particularly with high-mileage vehicles that have endured heavy use.
