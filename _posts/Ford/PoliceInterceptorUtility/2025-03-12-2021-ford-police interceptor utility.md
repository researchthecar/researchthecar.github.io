The 2021 Ford Police Interceptor Utility is a popular choice for law enforcement, known for its durability, spaciousness, and performance. It offers a blend of practicality and capability, making it well-suited for police work. Engine options include a 3.3L naturally aspirated V6 (285 hp, 260 lb-ft torque), a 3.0L EcoBoost V6 (400 hp, 415 lb-ft torque), and a 3.3L Hybrid V6 (318 hp combined). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the vehicle's robust construction, comfortable ride, and ample cargo space.
