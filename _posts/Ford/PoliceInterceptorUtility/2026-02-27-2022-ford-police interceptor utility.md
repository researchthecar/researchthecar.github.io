### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Ford Police Interceptor Utility demonstrates strong overall reliability, particularly in its powertrain options. The hybrid and standard V6 engines, along with the 10-speed automatic transmission, are generally robust. However, fleet operators should be aware of potential issues with the heavy-duty suspension components, specifically premature wear on struts and shocks, especially under heavy use. Electrical system concerns, such as intermittent accessory power loss and battery drain, are also noted, often linked to the integration of specialized police equipment. Interior wear on the driver's seat is a common, though not critical, concern. Proactive inspection and maintenance of suspension and electrical systems, particularly those related to upfitter installations, are recommended to ensure optimal performance and longevity.
