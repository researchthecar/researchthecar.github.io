The 2013 Ford Police Interceptor Utility, a variant of the Ford Explorer designed for law enforcement, was offered with two engine options: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing around 304 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 generating approximately 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the vehicle's spacious interior, ruggedness, and performance, while common dislikes include fuel economy and some reliability concerns stemming from the high-stress nature of police use.

**Engine**

**3.7L Ti-VCT V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Internal water pump failure can cause coolant to leak into the engine oil. Symptoms include coolant loss, overheating, milky oil, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump. This repair often requires significant labor as it is located inside the engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbocharger failure can result in reduced power, increased engine noise (whining or screeching), and potentially black smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ (depending on whether one or both turbos need replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks can occur from various locations, including the water pump, hoses, and turbocharger lines. Common symptoms are a sweet coolant smell, low coolant level, and overheating.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the source of the leak. This may involve replacing hoses, gaskets, or the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity and location of the leak)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6F50)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, and delayed engagement. These issues often stem from valve body wear or internal component failures.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild may be necessary. A fluid flush can sometimes temporarily alleviate the problem, but it's usually not a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) to $2,500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, especially during light acceleration. Can also lead to complete failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag/Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension can sag prematurely, especially under the constant weight of police equipment. This leads to a rougher ride and potentially compromised handling. Worn shocks, struts, and springs are also common.
    *   Solution: Replace worn shocks, struts, springs, and/or install heavy-duty components designed for the added weight.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+ (depending on the components replaced and the labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Wheel Bearing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud humming or grinding noise that changes with vehicle speed. Play in the wheel when the vehicle is lifted.
    *   Solution: Replace the wheel bearing assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+ per wheel.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the high electrical demands of police equipment, the alternators on these vehicles can fail prematurely. Symptoms include dimming lights, warning lights on the dashboard, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator with a heavy-duty or high-output unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Damaged or corroded wiring harnesses can cause a variety of electrical problems, including malfunctioning lights, sensors, and other electrical components.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the affected wiring harness. This can be a time-consuming and costly repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Hinge Wear/Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front doors, especially the driver's door, can experience hinge wear and sag due to frequent use and the weight of equipment attached to the door.
    *   Solution: Replace the door hinges.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$500+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2013 Ford Police Interceptor Utility, while generally a robust vehicle, is prone to certain issues arising from its heavy-duty usage. Engine problems, particularly water pump failure in the 3.7L V6 and turbocharger problems in the 3.5L EcoBoost, can be costly. Transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical problems are also prevalent. While the severity and cost of these issues vary, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and inspect used vehicles carefully or have them inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the problem.
