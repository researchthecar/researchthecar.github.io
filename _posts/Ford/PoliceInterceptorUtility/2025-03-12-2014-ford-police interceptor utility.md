The 2014 Ford Police Interceptor Utility is a specialized version of the Ford Explorer designed for law enforcement use. It offers enhanced durability, performance, and safety features compared to the civilian model. The 2014 Police Interceptor Utility came with two engine options: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 engine producing 305 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the vehicle's spacious interior, powerful engine options, and robust build quality. Common complaints include higher fuel consumption, stiffer ride quality compared to the standard Explorer, and specialized parts that can sometimes be more difficult to source.

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Police Interceptor Utility can be a reliable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the water pump in the 3.7L and turbochargers in the 3.5L EcoBoost, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical gremlins can also contribute to ownership costs. While some repairs are relatively minor, others can be quite expensive, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Pre-purchase inspections by a qualified mechanic are highly recommended.
