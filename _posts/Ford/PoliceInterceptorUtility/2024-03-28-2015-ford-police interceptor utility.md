The Ford Police Interceptor Utility is a popular choice for law enforcement agencies due to its ruggedness, performance, and spacious interior. It is available with either a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine or a 3.7L V6 engine, both of which are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.

Despite its popularity, the 2015 Ford Police Interceptor Utility has had its share of issues. Here is a comprehensive list of the specific issues people are having with the vehicles:

**Engine**

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail prematurely, causing a loss of power and increased exhaust smoke. This issue is most commonly caused by a faulty wastegate actuator.
* **Intake manifold cracking:** The intake manifold can crack, causing a vacuum leak and a loss of power.

* **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain can stretch or break, causing catastrophic engine damage.

**3.7L V6**

* **Valve cover gasket leak:** The valve cover gaskets can leak, causing oil leaks and a burning oil smell.
* **Spark plug failure:** The spark plugs can fail prematurely, causing engine misfires and a rough idle.

**Transmission**

**Six-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting problems:** The transmission may have difficulty shifting gears, causing hesitation or slipping. This issue is often caused by a faulty transmission control module (TCM).
* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter can shudder during acceleration, causing a vibration in the vehicle.
* **Transmission failure:** The transmission may fail completely, causing a loss of power and mobility.

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension creaking:** The front suspension can creak or groan over bumps, especially at low speeds.
* **Rear suspension sagging:** The rear suspension can sag prematurely, causing the vehicle to sit lower in the back.
* **Steering wheel vibration:** The steering wheel may vibrate at highway speeds, indicating a problem with the suspension or alignment.

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery can drain prematurely, leaving the vehicle unable to start. This issue is often caused by a faulty alternator or a parasitic draw in the electrical system.
* **Electrical gremlins:** The vehicle may experience random electrical problems, such as flickering lights, inoperative gauges, or intermittent starting issues.
