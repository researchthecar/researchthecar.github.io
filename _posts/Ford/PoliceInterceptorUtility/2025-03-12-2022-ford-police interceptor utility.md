Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2022 Ford Police Interceptor Utility, categorized by component, and engine/transmission options where relevant, following the format you requested.

The 2022 Ford Police Interceptor Utility is a popular choice for law enforcement due to its durability, performance, and cargo capacity. The vehicle comes standard with all-wheel drive and is available with three engine options: a 3.3L naturally aspirated V6 producing 285 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L EcoBoost V6 producing 400 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L Hybrid engine producing 318 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the vehicle's handling, acceleration (particularly with the EcoBoost), and overall robustness. Common complaints include firm ride quality, limited rear passenger space (due to police equipment), and potentially higher maintenance costs associated with heavy-duty use.

**Engine**

**3.0L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbocharger, loss of power, check engine light. Potential causes include oil starvation, bearing failure, or issues with the wastegate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected turbocharger(s). Diagnostic checks to identify the root cause of the failure (e.g., oil supply issues).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and whether one or both turbochargers need replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Engine Oil**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Milky or frothy appearance in the oil, elevated coolant levels in the oil pan, possible overheating, engine knocking. This is often caused by cracks in the engine block or cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Engine replacement or extensive engine repair including replacement of the cracked block or cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $6,000-$10,000+ for engine replacement, $4,000-$7,000+ for block/head replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L Naturally Aspirated V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**3.3L Hybrid**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (10R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or jerky shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Transmission slipping, where the engine revs up but the vehicle doesn't accelerate as expected. Delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM) is usually the first attempt. If that doesn't work, valve body replacement, or in severe cases, complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for TCM reprogramming, $800 - $2,000 for valve body replacement, $4,000 - $7,000+ for transmission replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Internal Component Failure (Specifically CDF Drum)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of certain gears, shuddering, and potential transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $7,000+ for transmission replacement, $2,500-$5,000 for a rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Reduced handling precision, feeling of looseness in the steering. Visible cracks or deterioration in the suspension bushings (control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn bushings. In some cases, replacement of the entire control arm may be necessary if the bushings are not available separately.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the specific bushing and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, needing to jump-start frequently. Can be caused by parasitic drain from aftermarket police equipment, faulty modules, or a failing battery.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic drain, repair or replace faulty module or aftermarket equipment causing drain. Replace the battery if it's not holding a charge.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ for battery replacement, $100 - $500+ for diagnostic and parasitic drain repair depending on the source.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SYNC System Glitches**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues, screen malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Software updates, SYNC module replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (if software update resolves the issue) to $500 - $1,500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Seat Frame Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken seat frames, rattling, popping or clunking noises when seated or adjusting the seat. Especially common with heavy use.
    *   Solution: Seat frame repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether the frame can be repaired or needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2022 Ford Police Interceptor Utility, while generally reliable, can experience some issues, particularly related to the 3.0L EcoBoost engine and the 10-speed transmission. Turbocharger failures and coolant intrusion into the oil can be expensive to repair on the 3.0L EcoBoost engine. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting and component failures, are also common and can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical problems related to battery drain and the SYNC system can be inconvenient. Suspension bushing wear is another common issue to watch for. The severity and cost of these issues can vary depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage.
