The 2016 Ford Police Interceptor Utility is a popular law enforcement vehicle known for its durability, spacious interior, and robust performance. It offered three engine options: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing 304 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 generating 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L naturally aspirated V6 producing 280 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers generally appreciate the vehicle's handling, cargo space, and suitability for police duty. Some common complaints include a stiff ride, less-than-stellar fuel economy (especially with the EcoBoost), and potential maintenance costs associated with a vehicle used in demanding conditions.
