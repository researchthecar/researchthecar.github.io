**Introduction:**

The 2020 Ford Police Interceptor Utility is a powerful and versatile law enforcement vehicle equipped with a 3.0L EcoBoost V6 engine paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. It delivers impressive performance with its 400 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque. Drivers appreciate its responsive handling, spacious interior, and advanced safety features. However, like any vehicle, it has its shortcomings.

**Engine**

**3.0L EcoBoost V6**

* **Turbocharger failure:** Symptoms include reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, and excessive smoke from the exhaust. The solution is to replace the turbocharger, which costs around $2,500 - $4,000+.
* **Fuel injector issues:** Faulty fuel injectors can lead to rough idling, misfiring, and poor fuel economy. Replacing the fuel injectors typically costs between $600 - $1,200+.

**Transmission**

**10-speed Automatic**

* **Transmission slipping:** This can occur when the transmission fluid is low or degraded. Flushing and replacing the transmission fluid usually resolves the issue and costs around $200 - $350+.
