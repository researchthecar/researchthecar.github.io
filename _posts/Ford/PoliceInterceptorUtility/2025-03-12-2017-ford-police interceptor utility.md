All engine options are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the vehicle's spacious interior, robust build quality, and powerful engine options, particularly the EcoBoost. Common complaints include fuel economy, occasional electrical issues, and general maintenance costs associated with a high-use vehicle.
