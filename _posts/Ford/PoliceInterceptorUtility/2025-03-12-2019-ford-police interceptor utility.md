The 2019 Ford Police Interceptor Utility is a popular choice for law enforcement agencies, known for its durability, spaciousness, and performance. This model year offered several engine options, including a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 engine (304 hp, 279 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine (365 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.3L hybrid engine. All engine options came paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the vehicle's cargo capacity, comfortable ride (for a police vehicle), and powerful engine options, particularly the EcoBoost. Common complaints often revolve around maintenance costs, fuel economy (especially with non-hybrid models), and the harshness of the ride due to the heavy-duty suspension.

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford Police Interceptor Utility presents a mixed bag of potential issues. The EcoBoost engine, while powerful, can suffer from turbocharger and cylinder head issues, leading to potentially expensive repairs. The 10-speed transmission is prone to shifting problems that may require extensive work. Suspension wear is common given the vehicle's heavy-duty use. Electrical issues, particularly battery drain, can be frustrating to diagnose and resolve. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be significant financial burdens. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any existing or potential problems.
