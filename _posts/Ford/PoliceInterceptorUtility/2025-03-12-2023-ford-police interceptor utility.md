Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2023 Ford Police Interceptor Utility, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options.

The 2023 Ford Police Interceptor Utility is a specialized SUV built for law enforcement purposes, derived from the Ford Explorer. Engine options include a 3.3L Hybrid V6 rated at 318 horsepower and 322 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L EcoBoost V6 producing 400 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L naturally aspirated V6. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Police departments appreciate the vehicle's spacious interior, robust performance, and available all-wheel drive. Some common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the EcoBoost engine), occasional electronic glitches, and the overall cost of maintenance due to its heavy-duty nature.

**Engine**

**3.0L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the engine, reduced power, check engine light. Potential oil leaks around the turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. Check oil lines for blockage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L Hybrid V6**

*   **Hybrid Battery Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced fuel economy, error messages related to the hybrid system, inability to utilize electric-only mode, potential complete failure to start.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the hybrid system, potential replacement of the hybrid battery pack or individual modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the extent of the battery damage and whether individual modules can be replaced.)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L Naturally Aspirated V6**

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission (10R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, clunking noises during gear changes, especially between 1st and 3rd gear. May be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM). If the problem persists, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.

    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving high without a corresponding increase in speed, hesitation during acceleration, or a feeling of the transmission "slipping" out of gear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of transmission fluid level and condition. Potential replacement of the CDF drum, valve body or complete transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (diagnosis), $800 - $1,500+ (valve body), $3,000 - $7,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or clunking noises from the suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose or sloppy handling.

**Summary**

The 2023 Ford Police Interceptor Utility exhibits a range of potential issues, with the most concerning relating to the 3.0L EcoBoost's turbocharger, hybrid battery problems in the 3.3L Hybrid V6, and transmission shifting irregularities in the 10-speed automatic. Electrical glitches and suspension bushing wear are also reported. The severity of these issues varies, with some being minor annoyances (loose trim) while others could lead to significant repair costs (turbocharger failure, transmission rebuild). Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and conduct thorough inspections and maintenance checks.
