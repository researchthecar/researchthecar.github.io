The 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac was a unique blend of SUV and pickup truck, offering a versatile option for buyers. It came with two engine options: a 4.0L Cologne V6 producing 205 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.0L SOHC V6 producing 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The transmission options were either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. People generally appreciated the Sport Trac for its comfortable ride, open bed, and decent off-road capability.
