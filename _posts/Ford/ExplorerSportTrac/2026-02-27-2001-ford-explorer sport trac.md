### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac presents a mixed reliability profile. The 4.0L V6 engine, while capable, is prone to timing chain and intake manifold issues that can be costly to repair. The 5R55E transmission can also develop problems with its solenoid pack and torque converter. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings are common wear items. Electrically, the Body Control Module can cause unpredictable issues, and window regulators are a frequent point of failure. Exterior concerns often revolve around frame rust, particularly in corrosive climates, and tailgate latch problems. Interiorly, HVAC blower motors and seat fabric wear are noted concerns. Despite these potential issues, many Sport Tracs have provided reliable service with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
