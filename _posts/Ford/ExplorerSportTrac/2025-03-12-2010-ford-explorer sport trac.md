The 2010 Ford Explorer Sport Trac is a unique mid-size pickup truck known for blending SUV comfort with truck utility. The 2010 model came with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.6L V8 generating 292 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Sport Trac's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and versatile cargo bed, although some dislike its fuel economy and dated styling. A common complaint is the availability of parts for certain issues.

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, especially on startup. Can lead to engine damage if the tensioner fails completely.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner, guides, and possibly the timing chains themselves.

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs breaking while trying to remove them for maintenance. The design of the 2-piece spark plugs (Ford part #SP-515) can cause the plugs to separate inside the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Use a spark plug extractor tool designed for this specific issue. Sometimes the cylinder head must be removed for professional extraction, or to repair any damage caused during removal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on severity)

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at lower speeds or during light acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Erratic Shifting/Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission shifting hard, slipping between gears, or failing to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Could be due to a faulty transmission control module (TCM), valve body issues, or worn clutches/bands. Diagnosis is essential. Replacing the TCM or valve body may be necessary. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be required.
