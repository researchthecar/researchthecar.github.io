# 2007 Ford Explorer Sport Trac

### Overview
The 2007 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, a mid-size pickup truck based on the Explorer SUV platform, offered a blend of passenger comfort and utility. It was available with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 and a more powerful 4.6L V8. Both engines were generally considered reliable, though like any vehicle, some common issues have been reported over time. The Sport Trac's design, sharing many components with the Explorer, means that some common SUV-related issues can also appear. This analysis focuses on documented, non-wear-and-tear related problems to provide a clear picture of its technical reliability.

### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford Explorer Sport Trac demonstrates a generally decent reliability record, particularly with the 4.6L V8 engine. The 4.0L V6, while common, has known issues like camshaft synchronizer problems and intake manifold leaks that owners should be aware of. Transmission issues, primarily with the 5R55W/S, such as solenoid pack and torque converter problems, are also documented. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear out, and common electrical issues include window regulators and instrument cluster failures. Exterior rust, especially on the frame, is a concern in certain climates. Overall, with proper maintenance and attention to these known potential issues, the Sport Trac can remain a functional and reliable vehicle.
