The 2008 Ford Explorer Sport Trac is a mid-size pickup truck that blends SUV comfort with truck utility. It was available with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.6L V8 generating 292 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Sport Trac's unique blend of truck bed functionality and SUV-like interior. Dislikes often include fuel economy, particularly with the V8, and some reported reliability concerns.
