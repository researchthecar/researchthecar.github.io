The 2004 Ford Explorer Sport Trac is a unique vehicle blending the practicality of a pickup truck with the comfort of an SUV. It was offered with two engine options: a 4.0L SOHC V6 producing 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque and a 4.6L SOHC V8 generating 239 horsepower and 282 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Sport Trac's versatility and relatively comfortable ride, while common dislikes include its fuel economy, smaller bed size compared to traditional trucks, and some reliability concerns.
