# 2009 Ford Explorer Sport Trac

### Overview
The 2009 Ford Explorer Sport Trac is a mid-size pickup truck that offered a blend of SUV comfort and truck utility. It was available with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 and a more powerful 4.6L V8. Both engines were generally considered reliable, though like any vehicle, they had specific areas that could experience issues over time. The Sport Trac's chassis and suspension were derived from the Explorer SUV, contributing to a comfortable ride but also inheriting some of the SUV's known suspension characteristics. Overall, the 2009 model year is viewed as a reasonably dependable option in its segment, with most reported issues falling into predictable categories for a vehicle of its age and design.
