### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford Transit Connect is a capable commercial vehicle, but like many vehicles in its class, it can experience specific issues related to its powertrain and chassis components. Common concerns include cooling system leaks and ignition coil problems with the gasoline engines, and transmission issues like harsh shifting or leaks with the automatic transmission. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and rear leaf springs, can wear over time due to heavy use. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and window regulator problems are also reported. While not indicative of a fundamentally unreliable vehicle, these are areas to monitor for potential repairs. Regular maintenance and addressing early symptoms can help mitigate costs and ensure continued serviceability.
