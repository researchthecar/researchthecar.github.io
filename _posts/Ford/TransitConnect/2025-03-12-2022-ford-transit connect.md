The 2022 Ford Transit Connect is a compact cargo van and passenger wagon known for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and versatility in urban environments. It is powered by a 2.0L GDI I-4 engine that produces 162 horsepower and 144 lb-ft of torque and is mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission.
