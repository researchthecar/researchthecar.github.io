The 2012 Ford Transit Connect is a compact cargo van known for its fuel efficiency and maneuverability, making it popular for small businesses and urban use. The 2012 model came with a single engine option: a 2.0L Duratec inline-4 engine, which produces around 136 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. A key selling point was its practicality and lower running costs compared to larger vans, although some owners found the engine underpowered, especially when fully loaded. A common complaint is the vehicle's basic interior and relatively stiff ride. It was only offered with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.0L Duratec I4**
* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, often detected by a sweet smell and/or low coolant level. May result in overheating if left unchecked. Source may be hoses, water pump, thermostat housing, or radiator.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component (hose, pump, housing, or radiator).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $600+ depending on the component and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ignition Coil Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, decreased performance, and the check engine light may illuminate.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty ignition coil. It's often recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4F27E)**
* **Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly from 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd.
    * Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or dirty, a fluid change might help. In more severe cases, valve body issues may require repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 for fluid change to $500-$1500+ for valve body work.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine revs up without corresponding acceleration, delayed engagement of gears, or inability to maintain speed on inclines.
    * Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition first. If that is correct, it may be a sign of worn clutches or internal damage requiring a rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ for a rebuild or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. May observe visible cracks in the leaf springs. Leads to poor ride quality and reduced load capacity.
    * Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the van is frequently used for hauling heavy loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Sliding Door Contact Plate Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of electrical functions within the sliding doors, such as power windows, locks, or lights. Caused by corrosion or damage to the contact plate that transfers power between the body and the door.
    * Solution: Clean or replace the sliding door contact plate.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Power Window Motor Failure**

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford Transit Connect, while a practical and efficient vehicle, has several common issues owners may encounter. Engine problems like coolant leaks and ignition coil failures can cause inconvenience and potential engine damage. Transmission issues, especially harsh shifting and slipping, can be costly to repair. Suspension problems, particularly with the rear leaf springs, affect ride quality and load capacity. Electrical problems with the sliding doors and power windows can be annoying and require attention. Lastly, interior door handles are prone to breaking. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others like transmission rebuilds can be substantial, so a thorough inspection is essential before purchase. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially debilitating problems, and the cost to repair varies accordingly, but potential buyers should be aware of these common failure points.
