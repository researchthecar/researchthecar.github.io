The 2020 Ford Transit Connect is a compact cargo van/passenger wagon known for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and versatile cargo space. It typically comes with a 2.0L GDI I4 engine producing around 162 horsepower and 144 lb-ft of torque. A less common engine option is the 2.5L Duratec I4, which is usually only available for fleet purposes, and delivers slightly more power. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its ease of parking, good gas mileage, and suitability for small businesses. Downsides often cited include limited power, especially when fully loaded, and some find the interior materials basic.

**Engine**

**2.0L GDI I4**

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light illuminated, difficulty starting, rough idling, and poor fuel economy. This is due to a faulty purge valve failing to properly regulate fuel vapor flow, which leads to an incorrect air-fuel mixture.
    *   Solution: Replace the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.5L Duratec I4**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (8F35)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, especially between lower gears. Some owners report the transmission feeling jerky or hesitant when accelerating.
    *   Solution: Some cases were solved by reprogramming the transmission control module (TCM). More severe cases may require transmission replacement or repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Reprogramming $100-$200+, Repair/Replacement $3,000 - $5,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The touchscreen infotainment system freezes, lags, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Software updates sometimes resolve the issue. In other cases, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $0 - $100, APIM Replacement: $500 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera display either shows a blank screen, distorted images, or fails to activate when the vehicle is put into reverse.
    *   Solution: Check the camera wiring and connections. If the wiring is okay, the camera unit itself may need replacing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   No Issues Found

**Interior**

*   **Sliding Door Latch Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The sliding door becomes difficult to open or close, or the latching mechanism fails to engage properly.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the latch mechanism and check for obstructions. If the problem persists, the latch assembly or cable may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford Transit Connect generally has a good reputation, but owners have reported issues with the engine (purge valve), transmission (shifting), electrical system (infotainment and backup camera), and sliding doors. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix (purge valve, door latch lubrication), others, such as transmission problems or APIM replacement, can be quite costly.
