The 2017 Ford Transit Connect is a compact cargo van/wagon known for its fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and practicality for small businesses and families. It came with two engine options: a 2.5L Duratec I4 engine producing 169 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L EcoBoost I4 engine making 178 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the van's compact size for city driving and parking, its versatile cargo space, and its relatively low running costs. Common dislikes include limited power, especially when fully loaded, and a somewhat basic interior.
