The 2016 Ford Transit Connect is a compact cargo van and passenger wagon known for its fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and versatile interior. It offered two engine options: a 2.5L Duratec I4 engine, producing around 169 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L EcoBoost I4 engine (available on earlier models), producing around 178 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Transit Connect for its practicality, ease of parking in urban environments, and decent fuel economy. Common complaints include limited cargo space compared to larger vans and potential reliability issues, particularly with the 1.6L EcoBoost engine and some electrical components.

**Engine**

**2.5L Duratec I4**

* **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine may run rough, idle unevenly, or experience misfires. Diagnostic codes P0300-P0304 (random misfire or misfire on specific cylinders) may be present.
    * Solution: Could be caused by worn spark plugs, faulty ignition coils, vacuum leaks, or issues with fuel injectors. Start with basic maintenance (plugs and coils) and then investigate further if the problem persists.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the cause and parts replaced).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormal amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Could be caused by worn piston rings, faulty PCV valve, or valve stem seals. A compression test can help determine the source of the issue. If worn piston rings are the cause, engine repair or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**1.6L EcoBoost I4**

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant levels drop rapidly, often accompanied by overheating. Obvious signs of coolant leak around the engine bay.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace cracked or leaking coolant hoses and plastic coolant fittings. The 1.6L EcoBoost engine is known for issues with coolant leaking from the cylinder head.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $1000+ (depending on the source and complexity).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires/Rough Idle**
    * Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.5L engine, the 1.6L can also experience misfires, rough idle, and associated diagnostic codes.
    * Solution: The same troubleshooting steps apply as with the 2.5L engine: check spark plugs, ignition coils, vacuum leaks, and fuel injectors.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the cause and parts replaced).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6F35)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Erratic or harsh shifting, particularly between certain gears. Transmission may slip or fail to engage gears properly.
    * Solution: A common cause is low transmission fluid level or contaminated fluid. Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal damage may require professional diagnosis and repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4,000+ (depending on the severity and repair needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Premature Wear of Front Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front end, particularly when driving over bumps. Uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Inspect and replace worn ball joints, tie rod ends, and sway bar links. These components are prone to wear, especially on vehicles used for heavy hauling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the components replaced and labor rates).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period, making it difficult to start the vehicle.
    * Solution: Check for parasitic draws using a multimeter. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty door/hatch switches, and malfunctioning modules.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the cause).
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power door locks may fail to operate properly, either not locking or unlocking, or making unusual noises.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per door (including parts and labor).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulties opening or closing the sliding doors, sticking or binding. Power sliding doors may fail to operate.
    * Solution: Lubricate the door tracks and rollers. Inspect the cables and mechanisms for damage. If the power sliding door motor or actuator is faulty, it may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on the cause and parts replaced).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Faulty Radio/Infotainment System**
    * Description/Symptoms: The radio or infotainment system may malfunction, freeze, or fail to power on. Touchscreen may become unresponsive.
    * Solution: Check the wiring and connections. Try resetting the system. If the problem persists, the unit may need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ (depending on the complexity and whether replacement is needed).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford Transit Connect, while praised for its versatility and fuel efficiency, can suffer from a range of issues. Engine problems, particularly coolant leaks with the 1.6L EcoBoost and misfires across both engines, are concerns. The 6-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting problems. Other notable issues include premature suspension wear and electrical glitches. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission repairs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchasing.
