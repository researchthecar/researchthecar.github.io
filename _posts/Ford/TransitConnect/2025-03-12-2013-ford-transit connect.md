The 2013 Ford Transit Connect is a compact cargo van and passenger wagon known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and maneuverability in urban environments. It came with two engine options: a 2.0L Duratec I-4 engine producing 136 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.6L EcoBoost I-4 engine producing 173 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Transit Connect for its car-like driving feel, excellent cargo capacity for its size, and relatively low running costs. Common complaints include limited power from the base engine, a somewhat basic interior, and less towing capacity compared to larger vans.
