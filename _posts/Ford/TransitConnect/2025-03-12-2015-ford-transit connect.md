**Summary:**

The 2015 Ford Transit Connect experiences a range of issues, with the engine being a significant area of concern due to potential coolant leaks in the 1.6L EcoBoost and oil consumption issues in the 2.5L. The 6-speed transmission can also exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the sliding doors, are present. Overall, while some issues may be relatively minor, others like engine or transmission replacements can be quite costly.
