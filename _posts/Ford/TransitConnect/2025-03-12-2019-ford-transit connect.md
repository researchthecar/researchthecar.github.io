The 2019 Ford Transit Connect is a compact van popular for its fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and cargo capacity. It comes in two wheelbase lengths and can be configured for passenger or cargo use. Engine options for the 2019 model year include a 2.0L GDI I-4 producing 162 hp and 144 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L iVCT I-4 generating 169 hp and 171 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the van's practicality, ease of parking, and gas mileage, while common complaints often revolve around ride quality, engine performance when fully loaded, and the limited power of the base engine.

**Engine**

**2.0L GDI I-4**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and potential engine damage can occur due to malfunctioning fuel injectors. Diagnostic codes related to misfires or fuel trim imbalances will likely appear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s) and subsequent reprogramming of the engine control unit (ECU).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The purge valve allows the EVAP system to vent fuel vapors from the fuel tank. When the purge valve fails, it causes rough idling, difficulty starting, and a check engine light with codes related to the EVAP system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.5L iVCT I-4**

*   No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported instances of harsh or delayed shifting between gears. This can be more pronounced when accelerating or decelerating.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a more thorough inspection of the transmission may be necessary, potentially leading to valve body replacement or, in severe cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) to $3,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature sagging of the rear leaf springs, particularly in vans frequently used for cargo hauling. This can lead to a lower ride height in the rear, reduced load-carrying capacity, and a compromised ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs with heavy-duty aftermarket options or OEM replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Electrical Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: In models equipped with power sliding doors, intermittent failures, or complete malfunction of the doors have been reported. This may involve the door not opening or closing properly, or the power door mechanism failing to engage.
    *   Solution: Troubleshooting the electrical wiring, connections, and the sliding door motor itself. Replacing faulty components such as the motor, wiring harness, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system, particularly the SYNC system, can experience freezing, crashing, or unresponsiveness.
    *   Solution: A software update. If that doesn't work, the entire infotainment system will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Mirror Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Side mirror motor not functioning correctly, causing the mirror to not adjust properly or make strange noises.
    *   Solution: Replacing the mirror assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling and Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive rattling and squeaking noises emanating from various interior panels and trim pieces, particularly in the cargo area or around the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Identifying the source of the noise and applying foam padding, felt tape, or tightening loose fasteners to dampen the vibrations.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the extent of the issue and whether professional assistance is required)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford Transit Connect, while a practical vehicle, is not without its issues. The most common problems appear to revolve around the fuel system for the 2.0L engine, the transmission, electrical components, and minor interior annoyances. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission repairs or electrical troubleshooting, can be more costly. The severity of these issues varies, but it's important to be aware of them when considering purchasing a used 2019 Transit Connect.
