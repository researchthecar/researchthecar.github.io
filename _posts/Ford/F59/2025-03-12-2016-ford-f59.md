The 2016 Ford F59 is a stripped chassis commonly used for walk-in vans, food trucks, and other commercial applications. It's a robust platform favored for its reliability and customization potential. Common engine options include the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine, producing around 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque, and the 5.9L Cummins diesel engine. The 6.8L V10 is generally preferred for its simpler maintenance and lower initial cost, while the Cummins offers superior fuel economy and longevity in heavy-duty applications. Owners typically appreciate the F59's solid frame and ample cargo capacity, but some dislike the dated interior design and relatively poor fuel economy.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.8L V10 is known for spark plugs breaking during removal, especially on higher mileage vehicles. This is due to corrosion and carbon buildup around the spark plug threads within the cylinder head. Symptoms include difficulty removing spark plugs, pieces of the spark plug breaking off inside the engine, and potential damage to the cylinder head threads.
    *   Solution: Using a penetrating oil specifically designed for spark plugs a few days before removal can help. Working on a warm (not hot) engine is beneficial. Use a torque wrench to apply the correct amount of force. Specialized tools like spark plug extractors are often required to remove broken plugs. In some cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed and professionally repaired if the threads are damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, depending on the severity of the breakage and the need for cylinder head repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold leaks are common due to thermal cycling and corrosion. These leaks can cause a noticeable ticking or hissing sound, especially on cold starts. They can also lead to reduced fuel economy and performance, and in severe cases, can allow exhaust fumes to enter the cabin. Cracks are visually apparent upon inspection.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked or leaking exhaust manifold(s) is necessary. New gaskets and hardware should be used to ensure a proper seal. In some cases, it may be necessary to resurface the cylinder head to ensure a flat mating surface.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+, depending on the shop.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.9L Cummins Diesel Engine**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**Ford 4R75E (Most Common Transmission Option)**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4R75E transmission can experience erratic shifting patterns, delayed engagement, or slipping between gears, particularly at higher mileage. These issues may be related to worn valve body components or solenoid failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scanning to identify any fault codes is the first step. Depending on the diagnosis, the solution may involve replacing the valve body, solenoids, or performing a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3500+, depending on the severity and chosen repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy loads often carried by F59-based vehicles, the leaf springs can sag over time or even break. Sagging leaf springs result in a reduced ride height and compromised handling. Broken leaves can create noise, instability, and safety concerns.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs with new or upgraded units is necessary. Consider heavier-duty springs designed for commercial applications.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1500+, depending on the spring type and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Parasitic battery drain can be a common issue. Symptoms include a dead battery after the vehicle sits for a short period (overnight or a few days).
    *   Solution: Diagnose the parasitic drain by systematically disconnecting fuses to isolate the circuit causing the drain. Repair or replace faulty components in the affected circuit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the complexity of the electrical fault.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford F59 is a generally reliable platform with some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The 6.8L Triton V10 can suffer from spark plug breakage and exhaust manifold leaks, while the transmission can experience erratic shifting. Suspension issues, such as sagging leaf springs, are also prevalent due to the vehicle's intended use. Electrical problems, such as parasitic battery drain, may also occur. The severity and cost of repairs vary depending on the specific issue and the chosen repair method, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. It's essential to thoroughly inspect the vehicle and address any known issues before purchasing.
