Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2019 Ford F-59 stripped chassis, following your specified format. This information is based on available online data, owner forums, and professional mechanic insights, focusing on recurring themes. The Ford F-59 is a stripped chassis typically used for delivery trucks and motorhomes. Common configurations include the 6.8L Triton V10 engine and the 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the chassis's robust build and payload capacity, but frequently cite concerns about fuel economy and specific mechanical issues. The 6.8L Triton V10 produces around 320 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to weakened threads, leading to a loud popping noise, misfire, and loss of power. This is a known issue on earlier versions of the 6.8L V10 but can still occur on the 2019 model year if not properly maintained or if spark plugs are overtightened.
    *   Solution: Repairing the cylinder head by installing thread inserts (e.g., Time-Sert or Helicoil) or replacing the cylinder head altogether. Using anti-seize compound on the spark plug threads and torquing to the manufacturer's specification is critical to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of damage and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold studs lead to exhaust leaks, causing a ticking noise that becomes louder as the engine warms up. Can also cause reduced fuel economy and decreased engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold and all broken studs. Using high-quality replacement studs and proper torque specifications during installation is essential.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, loss of power, check engine light with codes indicating misfires on specific cylinders. Can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, fuel injectors, or vacuum leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause using a scan tool and performing necessary repairs, such as replacing faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Addressing any vacuum leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 6R140 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and harsh shifts between gears, particularly noticeable during acceleration or deceleration. This can be caused by worn valve body components, low transmission fluid level, or contaminated fluid.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the issue persists, further diagnosis and repair of the valve body may be necessary. In some cases, replacing the valve body or rebuilding the transmission may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush); $500 - $2500+ (valve body or rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration. This can be caused by a failing torque converter clutch or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush with a fluid specifically designed for shudder reduction. In severe cases, replacing the torque converter is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid flush); $800 - $2000+ (torque converter replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level, flush transmission fluid, may require complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 (fluid flush); $3000 - $6000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sitting lower than normal, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potential bottoming out over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with new or upgraded units. Adding helper springs or air suspension can also improve load-carrying capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shock Absorbers**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and reduced ride comfort.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days of being fully charged. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty component or accessory.
    *   Solution: Performing a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain and repairing or replacing the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery light comes on, the battery does not charge properly, and the vehicle may stall.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame Rails**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust or more significant corrosion on the frame rails, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and treating the affected areas with a rust inhibitor. In severe cases, welding or frame replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard surface due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or using a dashboard cover to protect it from further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford F-59 stripped chassis, while generally robust, has some common issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. Engine problems like spark plug blowout and exhaust manifold leaks can lead to significant repair costs. The 6R140 transmission can exhibit harsh shifting or shuddering, requiring fluid flushes or more extensive repairs. Suspension and electrical issues can also occur. Overall, while most issues are not catastrophic, addressing them proactively can prevent more costly repairs down the road. Costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission work.
