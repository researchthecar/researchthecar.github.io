The 2011 Ford F59 chassis is a popular choice for commercial vehicles, particularly step vans and delivery trucks. This chassis was commonly equipped with a 6.8L Triton V10 engine, producing around 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. Some owners appreciate the F59's robust build and payload capacity, making it suitable for heavy-duty applications. However, common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, maintenance costs, and the relatively dated design. While the V10 engine is known for its power, it can be thirsty, leading to higher operating expenses. The F59 doesn't offer engine or transmission options outside of what is listed below.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The spark plugs in the 6.8L V10 engine are known to blow out of the cylinder heads, resulting in a loud popping noise, misfires, and a significant loss of power. This issue is often caused by insufficient thread engagement in the aluminum cylinder heads.
    *   Solution: Repairing the damaged threads in the cylinder head is necessary. A common fix is to install threaded inserts (like Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) to provide stronger threads. In severe cases, replacing the cylinder head may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold leaks are a common problem, often caused by cracks in the manifold itself or broken exhaust manifold studs. Symptoms include a ticking noise (especially when cold), reduced fuel economy, and a noticeable exhaust smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cracked manifold and/or broken studs is the typical solution. Using high-quality aftermarket manifolds and studs can help prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive. This is often due to wear and tear or overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter is the standard repair. It's also recommended to flush the transmission fluid and inspect for any debris that may have contributed to the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ (including labor and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the valve body can cause erratic shifting, harsh shifts, or failure to shift at all. This is often caused by wear and tear, contaminated fluid, or solenoid failures.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body is the typical solution. Ensure the transmission fluid is clean and at the correct level.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy loads these vehicles typically carry, the leaf springs can sag or break over time. This results in a reduced ride height, poor handling, and potential damage to other suspension components.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with heavy-duty aftermarket springs is the recommended solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the chassis' weight and constant use, ball joints and tie rod ends can wear out prematurely. Symptoms include loose steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn ball joints and tie rod ends is necessary to restore proper steering and handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wiring harnesses, particularly in the engine compartment and under the chassis, can experience corrosion and damage due to exposure to the elements. This can lead to various electrical problems, including sensor failures, intermittent starting issues, and lighting problems.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing damaged sections of the wiring harness is the solution. Thoroughly inspect and clean all electrical connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and location of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail due to the heavy electrical demands of commercial vehicles. Symptoms include a dead battery, dimming lights, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator with a high-output unit is the recommended solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Chassis and Body)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, particularly on the chassis and lower body panels, is a common issue, especially in regions with harsh winters and road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involves removing the rust, treating the metal, and applying a protective coating or paint. In severe cases, replacing rusted panels may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat, the dashboard can crack and warp.
    *   Solution: Replacing the dashboard or installing a dashboard cover is the common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Seat Wear/Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat cushions and upholstery can wear out prematurely due to constant use.
    *   Solution: Reupholstering or replacing the seats is the solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ per seat
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2011 Ford F59, while a capable chassis for commercial applications, is prone to certain issues. Engine problems like spark plug blowouts and exhaust manifold leaks can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as torque converter failure and valve body problems, are also common. Suspension wear due to heavy loads, along with electrical and rust concerns, contribute to the overall maintenance burden. Depending on the severity, these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand for major overhauls, making preventative maintenance crucial for long-term reliability.
