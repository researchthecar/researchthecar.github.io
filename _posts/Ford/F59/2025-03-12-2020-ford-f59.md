The 2020 Ford F-59 is a stripped chassis primarily used for walk-in delivery vans and motorhomes. It's built for heavy-duty applications, prioritizing durability and functionality over comfort and aesthetics. The 2020 model typically comes with a 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 engine, producing around 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, paired with a heavy-duty 6-speed automatic transmission (TorqShift 6). There are no other engine or transmission options for this model year. Owners appreciate the robust chassis and powerful engine for hauling heavy loads. Dislikes often center on the utilitarian design, limited features, and relatively low fuel economy.

**Engine**

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than normal oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. Visible blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: The issue is commonly with the PCV Valve system on top of the engine, allowing excessive oil to be sucked into the intake and burned with fuel, thus causing the oil consumption. The fix is to install a new PCV valve with an improved revision to reduce oil consumption.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Failed Engine Mounts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration, clunking noises from engine bay during acceleration/deceleration, visual cracks or tears in the rubber mounts.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed engine mounts, often both mounts are replaced at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and harsh shifts between gears, particularly noticeable during low-speed acceleration and deceleration. A loud "clunk" may be heard when shifting between Park, Reverse, and Drive.
    *   Solution: The most likely cause is valve body issues inside of the transmission. To fix this issue, you should replace the valve body with a new one to provide smoother shifts and eliminate the harsh clunking.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs higher than usual without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. The transmission may hesitate or fail to engage a gear.
    *   Solution: Transmission slipping is often caused by damaged internal components, such as worn clutch packs or a malfunctioning torque converter. A complete transmission rebuild or replacement is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. Reduced ride quality, bottoming out over bumps, and visible cracks or broken leaves in the leaf spring pack.
    *   Solution: Replace the sagging or broken leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used to carry heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing or swaying after hitting bumps, poor handling, and increased stopping distance.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn shocks/struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery drains overnight or after a short period of inactivity. Difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair parasitic draws in the electrical system. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS, TPMS, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights illuminate on the dashboard, indicating a problem with the ABS, TPMS, or other systems.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Frame/Chassis**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the frame, especially in areas exposed to road salt or moisture.
    *   Solution: Remove the rust and apply a rust-inhibiting coating or paint. In severe cases, frame repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking/Delamination**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appear on the dashboard surface, especially in areas exposed to sunlight. The dashboard material may also begin to peel away from the underlying structure.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or use a dashboard cover to conceal the damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford F-59, while a durable workhorse, is not without its issues. The most commonly reported problems relate to the engine (oil consumption, engine mounts), transmission (harsh shifting, slipping), and suspension (leaf spring failure). Electrical issues and rust formation are also potential concerns. While some issues, like sensor failures and worn shocks, are relatively inexpensive to fix, others, such as transmission rebuilds or frame repairs, can be quite costly. The severity and cost of these issues can vary significantly depending on vehicle usage, maintenance history, and environmental factors. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended.
