The 2017 Ford F-59 is a stripped chassis primarily used for walk-in delivery vans and motorhomes. It's favored for its robust build and suitability for upfitting, but also criticized for its utilitarian design and ride quality. The F-59 comes standard with a 6.8L Triton V10 engine, producing around 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a Ford 6R140 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the powertrain's durability and ample power for heavy-duty applications, while some dislike the fuel economy and dated interior.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs are ejected from the cylinder head, often damaging the threads. This results in a loud popping noise, misfire, and significant loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head, install thread inserts, and use anti-seize on the spark plug threads upon reinstallation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leaks are noticed through noise and smell. Cracks in the manifold are causing these leaks
    *   Solution: Replace the Exhaust Manifold
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 6R140 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Diagnostic codes related to torque converter clutch slippage may be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid. Inspect transmission for damage from debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeably hard or abrupt shifts between gears, especially 1-2 and 2-3 shifts. This can be accompanied by a clunking sound.
    *   Solution: Recalibrate the Transmission Control Module (TCM). If that does not work, replace the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, particularly at the rear. Vehicle leans to one side. Visible cracks or broken leaves in the leaf spring pack.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf spring pack. Consider upgrading to a heavier-duty spring pack if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ per spring pack
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing, poor handling, and reduced ride comfort. Leaking fluid from the shock absorbers.
    * Solution: Replace the shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery dies overnight or within a short period of being parked. Jump starts are needed.
    *   Solution: Diagnose parasitic draw to identify the component causing the drain. Repair or replace the faulty component. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Damaged, brittle, or corroded wiring. These conditions can lead to intermittent electrical problems.
    * Solution: Repair or replace sections of the wiring harness. Protect exposed wires with loom or electrical tape.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame and body components, particularly in areas exposed to road salt and moisture.
    *   Solution: Address rust spots by sanding, applying rust converter, and repainting. For severe rust, consider replacing affected body panels or frame sections. Apply rust preventative coatings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on severity and extent.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Blower motor fails to operate. Blower motor only works on some speed settings. Loud noise from the blower motor.
    * Solution: Replace the blower motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary:** The 2017 Ford F-59 presents a mix of potential issues, primarily centered around the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. The 6.8L V10 is prone to spark plug and exhaust manifold issues while the 6R140 transmission can suffer from torque converter issues and harsh shifting. Suspension components may wear out due to the vehicle's heavy-duty application. Electrical problems can range from simple battery drains to more complex wiring harness issues. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs varying accordingly. Addressing these issues proactively can help maintain the reliability and longevity of the F-59 chassis.
