The 2015 Ford F-59 is a bare chassis often used as the base for delivery trucks, shuttle buses, and recreational vehicles. It is generally favored for its robust build and payload capacity. However, some common complaints include ride quality and handling due to its heavy-duty nature. For the 2015 model year, the Ford F-59 was typically equipped with a 6.8L Triton V10 engine producing around 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Other engine options may have been available based on fleet customization, however, the 6.8L V10 was the most common.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The spark plug threads in the cylinder head can become damaged or stripped, especially during spark plug replacement. This can lead to misfires, reduced engine performance, and spark plugs being ejected from the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads using thread repair kits (like Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold cracks are not uncommon, leading to leaks. The leaks cause a noticeable ticking sound (especially when cold), reduced fuel economy, and potentially failed emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cracked exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 5R110W 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter may fail prematurely, leading to shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter and potentially flushing the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hard or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between gears. This can be due to valve body issues, worn solenoids, or contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Performing a transmission fluid flush, replacing the valve body, or replacing faulty solenoids.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy loads the F-59 chassis often carries, the leaf springs can sag or even crack over time, leading to poor ride quality, reduced load capacity, and potential safety issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs with heavy-duty replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time and use, the shocks and struts can wear out, leading to a bouncy or unstable ride.
    *   Solution: Replacing the shocks and struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with the wiring harness, particularly in areas exposed to the elements. This can lead to various electrical problems, including malfunctioning lights, sensors, and other components.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the damaged sections of the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail prematurely, resulting in a dead battery, dimming lights, and other electrical issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The frame can be prone to rusting, especially in areas where road salt is used.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and coating the frame to prevent rust, or replacing severely rusted sections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on severity and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford F-59 is a robust chassis, but it does have some common issues. The engine and transmission can experience problems related to spark plug threads, exhaust manifolds, torque converters, and shifting. Suspension issues such as sagging leaf springs can also arise due to the heavy-duty nature of the vehicle. Electrical issues with wiring and alternator failures can occur, and the frame is susceptible to rusting. The severity and cost of repairs can vary widely, with some issues being relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, while others can be more extensive and costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and have the vehicle inspected thoroughly before purchase.
