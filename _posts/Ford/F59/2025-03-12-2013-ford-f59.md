The 2013 Ford F-59 is a popular stripped chassis primarily used for walk-in vans, delivery trucks, and motorhomes. The primary engine option for this model year is the 6.8L Triton V10 engine, producing around 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. While the F-59 provides a robust platform for commercial applications, owners have reported some common issues. Owners generally appreciate the F-59's heavy-duty construction and payload capacity, but some dislike the fuel economy and maintenance costs associated with a large displacement engine. The transmission option is the Ford 5R110W TorqShift 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**
* **Spark Plug Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners report spark plugs breaking or seizing in the cylinder heads during removal, particularly on higher mileage vehicles. This can lead to significant engine repair costs. Symptoms include misfires, rough idling, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Use caution when removing spark plugs, applying penetrating oil and working slowly. If a plug breaks, specialized extraction tools may be required. Anti-seize compound is crucial upon reinstallation.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the severity and whether head removal is necessary.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifolds on the 6.8L V10 are prone to cracking or warping, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking sound that gets louder upon acceleration, reduced fuel economy, and a possible exhaust smell in the cabin.
    * Solution: Replacement of the cracked or warped exhaust manifold.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per manifold, depending on labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **PCV Valve Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve can fail, causing increased oil consumption, rough idling, and potential damage to engine seals.
    * Solution: Replace the PCV valve.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The valve body in the 5R110W can experience wear and tear, leading to shifting problems, harsh shifts, slipping, or failure to shift.
    * Solution: Valve body replacement or rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failures can manifest as shuddering during acceleration, transmission overheating, and a loss of power transfer.
    * Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $3,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Given the F-59's use as a heavy-duty platform, the leaf springs are prone to sagging or even cracking over time, especially when consistently loaded near its GVWR. This can cause ride quality issues, reduced load capacity, and handling problems.
    * Solution: Leaf spring replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per spring (depending on whether it's a single leaf or the entire assembly).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Chassis Wiring Harness Corrosion**
    * Description/Symptoms: Due to its commercial use and exposure to the elements, the chassis wiring harness can suffer from corrosion, leading to various electrical problems such as lighting issues, sensor malfunctions, and starting problems.
    * Solution: Inspection, cleaning, and repair/replacement of corroded wiring sections or the entire harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The high electrical demands of a commercial vehicle can lead to premature alternator failure. Symptoms include dimming lights, a dead battery, and a warning light on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Alternator replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2013 Ford F-59, while generally reliable for its intended purpose, does have some common issues. The most prevalent involve the 6.8L Triton V10 engine and the 5R110W transmission, with spark plug issues, exhaust manifold leaks, valve body issues, and torque converter failures being relatively common. Suspension components are also susceptible to wear due to the heavy-duty nature of the vehicle. Electrical problems stemming from wiring harness corrosion can also occur. The severity of these issues can range from minor repairs costing a few hundred dollars to major overhauls exceeding several thousand dollars. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect these areas and review the vehicle's maintenance history to mitigate potential problems.
