# 2016 Ford F59

### Overview
The 2016 Ford F59 is a commercial stripped chassis model designed for upfitting into various vocational vehicles, such as delivery trucks, shuttle buses, and RVs. Its robust construction and focus on utility mean that reliability data often pertains to the base chassis and its core mechanical components rather than specific consumer-facing features. The F59 is built for demanding work environments, emphasizing durability and serviceability. While specific failure rates for individual components can vary significantly based on the upfit and operational use, the underlying Ford chassis generally aims for a high degree of operational uptime. This analysis focuses on common areas of concern for heavy-duty chassis vehicles.

### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford F59 chassis is engineered for commercial use, prioritizing durability and functionality. The most commonly reported issues tend to be related to the powertrain, particularly the 6.8L V10 engine's intake manifold and spark plug retention, and the 6R140 transmission's torque converter. Suspension components, especially leaf springs and bushings, can experience wear due to heavy loads. Electrical system issues like alternator failure are also noted. The chassis electrical system and exterior/interior components, being less complex than in a finished vehicle, generally show fewer widespread problems. Regular maintenance and addressing issues promptly are crucial for maintaining the operational integrity of these workhorse vehicles.
