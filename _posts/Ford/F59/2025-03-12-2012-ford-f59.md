The 2012 Ford F-59 is a popular stripped chassis used primarily for walk-in vans, delivery trucks, and recreational vehicles. It was typically offered with a 6.8L Triton V10 engine, which produced around 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission option for that year was the Ford 5R110W TorqShift 5-speed automatic transmission. The F-59 is appreciated for its robust construction and suitability for heavy-duty applications, but owners sometimes report issues related to the engine, transmission, and chassis components due to its workhorse nature. Some complaints revolve around fuel economy and maintenance costs, reflecting the demands placed on these vehicles in commercial service.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

* **Spark Plug Blowout**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 6.8L Triton V10 engine in some Ford vehicles (including the F-59 chassis) had issues where spark plugs would eject from the cylinder head due to insufficient thread engagement. Symptoms include a sudden loud popping noise, loss of engine power, and a check engine light.
    * Solution: Repair typically involves installing thread inserts (such as Time-Sert or similar) to restore the threads in the cylinder head. Alternatively, the cylinder head may need to be replaced in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and the repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifolds can crack or warp, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking or hissing noise, especially upon cold start, reduced fuel economy, and a smell of exhaust fumes.
    * Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold and gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Ignition Coil**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires can occur due to failing ignition coils, leading to rough running and reduced power.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty coil(s) is required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per coil (including labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause shuddering during acceleration, poor fuel economy, and eventually complete loss of drive.
    * Solution: Replacing the torque converter and flushing the transmission fluid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shifts are delayed or occur much more violently than usual.
    * Solution: Rebuild or replace the valve body with updated components. Perform a transmission flush with correct fluid.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (for valve body repair) $2,000 - $4,500 (for Transmission Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Given the heavy-duty nature of the F-59, leaf springs can sag, crack, or break. Symptoms include a noticeable lean, poor ride quality, and clunking noises from the suspension.
    * Solution: Replacing the affected leaf springs and associated hardware.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ per spring (including labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    * Description/Symptoms: Degradation of ride quality, excessive bouncing, and poor handling.
    * Solution: Replacement of shocks/struts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the specific component and labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Wiring Harness Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Given the commercial use of these vehicles, wiring harnesses can experience wear and tear, leading to shorts, open circuits, and intermittent electrical problems. Symptoms can include malfunctioning lights, sensors, or other electrical components.
    * Solution: Diagnosing and repairing damaged wiring harnesses. This may involve splicing, replacing connectors, or replacing entire sections of the harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and location of the damage)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the chassis, frame, and body panels, particularly in regions with harsh winters or coastal environments.
    * Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. Applying rust-inhibiting coatings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Highly variable depending on the extent of the rust damage.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Cracking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dashboard cracking, especially on sun-exposed vehicles.
    * Solution: Dash cover installation or dash replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford F-59, while a robust and reliable chassis for commercial applications, can experience issues related to its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and body. Engine problems, such as spark plug blowout and exhaust manifold leaks, are common. Transmission issues like torque converter failure and harsh shifting can arise. Suspension issues include leaf spring failure and worn shocks, stemming from the vehicle's heavy-duty usage. Electrical wiring issues and rust are also potential problems. While some of these issues are relatively minor, others can be costly to repair. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the severity.
