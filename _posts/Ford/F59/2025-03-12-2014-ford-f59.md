Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2014 Ford F59 chassis, broken down by category and component. The Ford F59 is a stripped chassis primarily used for step vans and delivery trucks. It came standard with a 6.8L Triton V10 engine paired with a 5-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. Owners appreciate its robust build and suitability for heavy-duty applications, but often cite concerns about fuel economy and maintenance costs due to the heavy-duty nature of the vehicle.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs may break upon removal due to a two-piece design. This can damage the cylinder head threads and require extensive repair to remove the broken plug. Misfires and rough running can occur.
    *   Solution: Use caution when removing spark plugs, and consider using a spark plug extraction tool. If threads are damaged, a thread repair kit or cylinder head replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifolds can crack or warp, leading to exhaust leaks. This results in a ticking noise, reduced engine performance, and potentially failed emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked or warped exhaust manifold. Use updated manifold designs or aftermarket manifolds designed to resist warping.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic (5R110W)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The valve body can experience wear and tear, leading to shift problems such as harsh shifts, slipping, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Consider upgrading to a remanufactured valve body with improved components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause shuddering, vibrations, or complete loss of power transfer.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Ensure the transmission is properly flushed and serviced during replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs on the F59 can sag or break, especially under heavy loads. This leads to a rough ride, reduced load capacity, and potential handling problems.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with heavy-duty aftermarket options. Consider adding helper springs or airbags for increased load support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of repair and added components)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rods**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ball joints and tie rod ends can wear out, resulting in loose steering, wandering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and tie rod ends. Get a wheel alignment after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wiring harness can experience corrosion or damage, leading to electrical problems such as intermittent lights, sensor failures, or starting issues.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace damaged sections of the wiring harness. Use dielectric grease on connections to prevent corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Alternator failure results in a discharged battery, dimming lights, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator. Check the battery and charging system for underlying issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting/Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the chassis and body, especially in areas exposed to salt and moisture.
    *   Solution: Treat rust with rust converter and apply protective coatings. Address any sources of moisture intrusion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor can fail, resulting in no airflow from the vents.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor. Check the blower motor resistor for damage as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can crack due to prolonged exposure to sunlight and temperature changes.
    *   Solution: Dash repair kit or full dash replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford F59 is a robust chassis known for its heavy-duty capabilities, but owners should be aware of potential issues related to the V10 engine (spark plugs, exhaust manifolds), transmission (valve body, torque converter), suspension (leaf springs, ball joints), and electrical systems (wiring harness, alternator). Rust is also a common concern. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive repairs, others can lead to more significant costs, potentially ranging from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Careful inspection and preventative maintenance are crucial to minimizing these issues.
