Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2022 Ford F-59 stripped chassis, formatted for your website. This information is based on available data and common trends. Keep in mind that individual experiences may vary.

The 2022 Ford F-59 is a stripped chassis primarily used for walk-in vans and delivery trucks. It's often equipped with a 7.3L V8 gasoline engine known as the "Godzilla" engine, which delivers around 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, paired with a Ford TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. While appreciated for its robust build and payload capacity, common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride quality (inherent to the chassis design), and potential issues arising from the heavy-duty use these vehicles typically endure.

**Engine**

**7.3L V8 "Godzilla"**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring frequent top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Symptoms include low oil level warnings, visible blue smoke from the exhaust (in severe cases), and the need to add oil every few thousand miles.
    *   Solution: Monitoring oil levels closely and addressing any leaks promptly. In some cases, a revised PCV (Positive Crankcase Ventilation) valve or other engine modifications may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Diagnostic tests range from $75 - $150. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the cause, ranging from a few hundred dollars for a PCV valve replacement to thousands for more extensive engine work.
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Train Noise (Ticking)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping sound emanating from the engine, particularly at idle or low speeds. This may be related to valve train components or issues with the hydraulic lash adjusters (HLAs).
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic is essential. The solution could involve replacing faulty HLAs or addressing other valve train issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+, depending on the extent of the repairs and the specific components that need replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter replacement. If the issue persists, the problem could be related to the valve body, solenoids, or internal components. A software update may also resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush and filter: $200 - $400. Valve body replacement: $800 - $1,500+. Transmission rebuild or replacement: $3,000 - $6,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Delayed Engagement**
    * Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between shifting into gear (Drive or Reverse) and the vehicle actually moving.
    * Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. A low fluid level is often caused by a leak. If the fluid is burnt or contaminated, a fluid flush and filter change may help. If the problem persists, it could be a sign of internal damage requiring a more extensive repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Minor repairs like fluid changes or seal replacements may cost $100 - $500. More extensive repairs like transmission rebuilds or replacements could cost $3,000 - $7,000 or more.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F-59 chassis utilizes leaf springs, which can experience sagging, cracking, or excessive wear, particularly under heavy loads. This can result in a rough ride, reduced load capacity, and potential safety concerns.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn or damaged leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the vehicle is consistently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per spring, including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors (e.g., ABS sensors, speed sensors, etc.) can fail, leading to warning lights on the dashboard and potential drivability issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific sensor that is malfunctioning and replacing it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor, including diagnosis and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The F-59 chassis, especially in regions with harsh climates, is susceptible to rust and corrosion, particularly on the frame, suspension components, and underbody.
    *   Solution: Regular washing, undercoating, and rustproofing to protect exposed metal surfaces. Addressing any signs of rust promptly to prevent further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Rust repair costs can vary widely, from a few hundred dollars for minor surface rust to several thousand dollars for more extensive structural repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the heating and air conditioning system, such as weak airflow, inconsistent temperatures, or complete failure. This can be caused by refrigerant leaks, compressor issues, or problems with the blower motor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific issue and replacing or repairing the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+, depending on the complexity of the repair.
     *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford F-59 chassis, while robust and capable, is subject to common issues relating to the engine, transmission, suspension, electrical system, and corrosion. Oil consumption and valve train noise are prevalent within the engine. The transmission can have harsh shifting and delayed engagement. Suspension concerns typically involve leaf springs. Electrical issues mainly concern sensor malfunctions. Corrosion can occur on the chassis and underbody. The cost to fix these issues can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the extent of the damage, ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for more extensive work.
