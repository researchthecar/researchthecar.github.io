The 2018 Ford F-59 is a stripped chassis primarily used for walk-in delivery vans and motorhomes. The most common engine option is the 6.8L Triton V10 engine, which produces around 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. A notable benefit of the F-59 is its robust chassis, capable of handling heavy loads. Some downsides include the relatively high fuel consumption associated with the V10 engine, and potential maintenance costs due to its specialized commercial application. The Ford F-59 is built with the Ford 6R140 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs breaking during removal (typically on higher mileage vehicles), leading to potential cylinder head damage. Misfires.
    *   Solution: Using specialized spark plug removal tools and techniques or professional extraction. Replacing spark plugs with updated design to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Crack and leak exhaust causing noise and exhaust smell in the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 6R140 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or unpredictable shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or during deceleration.
    *   Solution: A software reflash/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, valve body replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+ (for software) to $800 - $1500+ (for valve body)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken or sagging leaf springs due to heavy load, resulting in reduced ride height and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected leaf springs. Consider upgraded, heavy-duty leaf springs for vehicles consistently carrying heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$1000 per spring+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion or damage to wiring harnesses, especially in areas exposed to the elements (underneath the chassis). This can cause a variety of electrical issues, including lighting problems, sensor malfunctions, and starting issues.
    *   Solution: Inspect and repair or replace damaged wiring harnesses. Apply dielectric grease to connectors to prevent corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Step Well Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rusted out step wells due to the nature of the vehicles constant exposure to wet conditions
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rusted step well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2018 Ford F-59, primarily equipped with the 6.8L Triton V10, presents a mix of issues typical for a commercial chassis. The engine may experience spark plug and exhaust manifold issues, leading to moderate repair costs. The transmission may have issues, leading to costly repairs. Suspension components are vulnerable, requiring spring replacements due to vehicle use. Wiring harness problems require meticulous attention. In summary, while a robust chassis, it is wise to inspect these vehicles to identify potential issues that can be costly to repair.
