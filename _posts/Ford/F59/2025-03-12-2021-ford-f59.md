The 2021 Ford F-59 is a stripped chassis primarily used for walk-in vans, delivery trucks, and similar commercial applications. It is designed for heavy-duty use and customization. For the 2021 model year, the primary engine option is the 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 engine, producing around 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a Ford 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the robust nature of the chassis and its suitability for various upfitting needs. Common complaints often revolve around the limited factory features (as it's a stripped chassis) and the specific challenges related to the upfitting process.

**Engine**

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher-than-expected oil consumption, requiring more frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can manifest as a noticeable decrease in oil level on the dipstick over a few thousand miles and blueish smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: The solution will be determined by the source of the oil consumption. Start with performing a compression test to check for worn piston rings, inspecting the PCV system for proper function, or checking for external oil leaks around valve cover gaskets or the oil pan. If the rings are worn, then the engine will need to be rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 6-Speed Automatic (6R140)**

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report experiencing harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between 2nd and 3rd gear. This can present as a noticeable jolt or hesitation during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition first. A fluid change, filter change, and a valve body inspection is often the solution. For more severe cases, the transmission may require a full rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature sagging in the leaf springs, particularly on vehicles that are heavily loaded or consistently used at their maximum GVWR. This can lead to reduced ride height and compromised handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs with heavier-duty aftermarket options designed for commercial use.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Chassis Wiring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the chassis wiring harness, including frayed wires, loose connections, and corrosion, especially in areas exposed to the elements. These issues can manifest as intermittent electrical malfunctions, such as lighting problems or sensor failures.
    *   Solution: Thorough inspection of the wiring harness, repair or replacement of damaged wires and connectors, and application of dielectric grease to prevent future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford F-59 is generally a robust chassis, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as excessive oil consumption in the 7.3L engine, harsh shifting in the 6-speed transmission, and suspension sagging with heavy use. Electrical issues related to the chassis wiring can also occur. The cost of repairs can range from relatively minor fixes to more significant engine or transmission work.
