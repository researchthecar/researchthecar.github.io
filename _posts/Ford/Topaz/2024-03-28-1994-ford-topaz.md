A more powerful 3.0L V6 was also available, producing 160 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

The Topaz was praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and fuel efficiency. However, it was also criticized for its lack of performance, bland styling, and poor handling.

**Engine**

* **2.3L Inline-4**
    * **Blown head gasket:** This issue is caused by a faulty head gasket that allows coolant to leak into the cylinders. Symptoms include overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and a loss of power. The solution is to replace the head gasket. Estimated cost to fix: $500 - $1,000+
