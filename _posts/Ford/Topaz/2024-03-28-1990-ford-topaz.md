**Introduction:**

The 1990 Ford Topaz is a midsize sedan offered with two engine options: a 2.3L inline-four producing 110 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing 140 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque. Both engines can be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission. The Topaz was known for its comfortable interior, fuel efficiency, and affordability, but it also had several issues that could arise.

**Engine**

**2.3L Inline-Four**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** A faulty intake manifold gasket leads to coolant and oil leaks, rough idling, and engine overheating. Replace intake manifold gasket. $300 - $500+

* **Head Gasket Failure:** A leaking head gasket results in coolant mixing with oil, overheating, and white smoke from exhaust. Replace head gasket. $1,000 - $2,000+

**3.0L V6**

* **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** A leaking valve cover gasket causes oil leaks and a burning oil smell. Replace valve cover gasket. $200 - $300+

* **Power Loss:** A faulty ignition coil or spark plugs can result in sudden power loss or difficult starting. Replace ignition coil or spark plugs. $100 - $200+

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Issues:** Difficulty engaging gears, slipping, or chattering while shifting can be caused by a worn clutch or master cylinder. Replace clutch or master cylinder. $400 - $800+

**3-Speed Automatic**

* **Delayed Engagement:** The transmission may delay shifting or refuse to engage altogether, often due to a faulty solenoid or torque converter. Repair or replace faulty components. $500 - $2,000+

**Suspension**

* **Front Suspension Wear:** Worn ball joints, tie rods, or control arms lead to loose steering, clunking noises, and difficulty maintaining alignment. Replace worn components. $200 - $500+ per side

* **Rear Suspension Sagging:** Weak rear springs or struts can cause the vehicle to sag, reducing handling and ride quality. Replace springs or struts. $300 - $600+

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** A faulty alternator may fail to charge the battery, resulting in dimming lights, slow cranking, and power loss. Replace alternator. $300 - $500+

* **Battery Drain:** A parasitic draw can drain the battery overnight. Diagnose and repair the source of the drain. $100 - $300+

**Exterior**

* **Cracked Taillight Lenses:** Exposure to sunlight and extreme temperatures can cause the taillight lenses to crack. Replace taillight lenses. $100 - $200+

* **Antenna Issues:** A faulty antenna mast or connection can cause poor radio reception or static noise. Repair or replace antenna components. $100 - $200+

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Lights Failure:** Faulty dashboard lights make it difficult to view information while driving at night. Replace bulbs or repair electrical connections. $50 - $200+

* **HVAC System Issues:** Malfunctioning heater core, blower motor, or air conditioning compressor can result in inadequate heating or cooling. Repair or replace faulty parts. $200 - $1,000+

**Summary:**

The 1990 Ford Topaz can experience various issues that range from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures. While the engine and transmission issues can be costly to repair, suspension and electrical problems tend to be less expensive. Proper maintenance and regular inspections can help extend the life of the vehicle and minimize the likelihood of encountering these issues.
