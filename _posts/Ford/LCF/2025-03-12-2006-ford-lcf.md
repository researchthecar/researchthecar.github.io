The 2006 Ford LCF (Low Cab Forward) is a medium-duty commercial truck designed for maneuverability and ease of access in urban environments. It was primarily offered with a 4.5L Power Stroke V6 diesel engine, producing around 200 horsepower and 440 lb-ft of torque. A 6.0L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine was available in later years. Drivers often appreciate the LCF's tight turning radius and clear visibility. However, the truck has faced criticisms for its complex diesel engine systems and related maintenance costs.
