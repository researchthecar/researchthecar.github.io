The 2007 Ford LCF (Low Cab Forward) is a Class 4 and 5 commercial truck designed for urban delivery and service applications. It was only offered with a single engine and transmission option, the 4.5L Power Stroke V6 diesel and a 5-speed automatic transmission (Ford TorqShift 5R110W). This engine produces 200 horsepower and 440 lb-ft of torque. Owners appreciate the LCF's maneuverability and visibility in tight spaces, making it well-suited for city driving. However, they often complain about its cramped cab, relatively underpowered engine for heavy loads, and the complexity and cost of repairs, especially regarding the diesel emissions systems.
