Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2001 Ford E-450 Econoline Super Duty. This vehicle was popular for its robust build and use as a work van, ambulance, shuttle bus, and motorhome chassis. The 2001 E-450 offered several engine options: the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp, 425 lb-ft of torque), and the 7.3L Power Stroke Diesel V8 (215 hp, 425 lb-ft of torque). Owners generally appreciate the E-450's dependability and high payload capacity. Common complaints center around fuel economy, handling (particularly when heavily loaded), and age-related issues that are typical for a vehicle of this vintage. A 4-speed automatic transmission was the standard offering.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton engine is known for spark plugs blowing out of the cylinder head due to insufficient thread engagement in the aluminum head. This results in a loud popping noise, misfire, and significant loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads in the cylinder head using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Helicoil) or replacing the cylinder head altogether. Careful torqueing of the spark plugs is essential after the repair to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the repair method (thread repair vs. cylinder head replacement) and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The original plastic intake manifolds are prone to cracking, particularly around the coolant passages. This can lead to coolant leaks and engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold with an updated version (often with improved materials) and replacing the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, the 6.8L V10 can also experience spark plug blowout issues due to insufficient threads in the cylinder heads.
    *   Solution: Thread repair with a kit like Time-Sert, or cylinder head replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold studs are a common problem. This causes exhaust leaks that sound like a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken exhaust manifold studs and/or the exhaust manifold if it's warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Power Stroke Diesel V8**

*   **Cam Position Sensor (CPS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CPS can fail, leading to stalling, rough running, and a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CPS. It's often recommended to use a Motorcraft sensor for better reliability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Injectors can wear out or become clogged, leading to poor fuel economy, rough idling, and white smoke.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per injector. Can be a costly repair if multiple injectors need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or harsh shifts. This can be due to worn clutches, valve body issues, or low fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change, valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) to $3000+ (rebuild or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, stalling, or abnormal noises from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, clunking noises from the front end, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints and tie rod ends. An alignment is required after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sagging Leaf Springs (Rear)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, especially when loaded. Reduced ride quality and bottoming out over bumps.
