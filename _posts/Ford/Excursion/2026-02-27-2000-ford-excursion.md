### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Ford Excursion, while a capable and powerful vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and heavy-duty nature. The Triton V8 engines are known for potential spark plug issues, and the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel can face injector O-ring problems. The 4R100 transmission, though generally robust, can experience torque converter issues and overheating under heavy use. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, especially with high mileage or heavy loads. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the instrument cluster and power windows, are also reported. Rust can be a significant concern depending on the vehicle's climate history. Despite these potential issues, many Excursions remain on the road due to their durable underlying construction, but owners should be prepared for specific maintenance and repair needs.
