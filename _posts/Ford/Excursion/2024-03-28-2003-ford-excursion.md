**Introduction**

The 2003 Ford Excursion is a full-size SUV that was available with a choice of two gasoline engines and two transmission options. The base engine was a 5.4-liter V8 that produced 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. The optional engine was a 6.8-liter V10 that produced 310 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were available with either a four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual transmission.

The Excursion was popular with consumers for its spacious interior, powerful engines, and towing capacity. However, it was also criticized for its poor fuel economy and large size.
