**Introduction:**

The 2004 Ford Excursion is a full-size SUV that was produced until 2006. It was offered with four engine options and two transmission options. The base engine was a 5.4L V8 with 265 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. A 6.0L V8 with 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque was also available, as well as a 7.3L V8 diesel with 250 horsepower and 505 lb-ft of torque. The most powerful engine option was a 6.8L V10 with 310 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with either a 4-speed automatic transmission or a 5-speed manual transmission, except for the 7.3L diesel which was only available with the automatic transmission.

Many owners of the Excursion are satisfied with its powerful engines, spacious interior, and off-road capability. However, there are some issues that have been reported with the vehicle.

**Engine**

**5.4L V8**

* **Intake Manifold Runner Control Failure:** The intake manifold runner control may fail, which can cause the engine to run rough, stall, or experience decreased power. The solution is to replace the intake manifold runner control. Estimated cost to fix: $200-$400

* **Head Bolt Failure:** Head bolts can fail on 6.0L V8 engines produced between 2003 and 2005, which can lead to severe engine damage. The solution is to replace the head bolts. Estimated cost to fix: $2,000-$4,000

**7.3L V8 Diesel**

* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger may fail on 7.3L V8 engines, which can lead to decreased power and increased emissions. The solution is to replace the turbocharger. Estimated cost to fix: $1,000-$2,000

**6.8L V10**
