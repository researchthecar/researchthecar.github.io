The 2004 Ford Excursion is a full-size SUV known for its immense size, towing capacity, and passenger space. This year offered three engine choices: the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp, 425 lb-ft torque), and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (325 hp, 560 lb-ft torque). All engines were paired with a 4R100 4-speed automatic transmission, except for the diesel which used the 5R110 TorqShift 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Excursion for its ability to comfortably transport large families and tow heavy loads. However, some common complaints revolve around its fuel economy, size (making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces), and age-related maintenance issues.

**Engine**

    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler and thoroughly flush the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Injector stiction, caused by oil deposits, can lead to rough running, hard starting, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Use fuel additives designed to clean injectors, or replace the affected injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (additive) - $2,000+ (injector replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HPOP provides the high pressure oil needed for the fuel injectors to function. Failure results in a no-start condition or poor performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPOP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
