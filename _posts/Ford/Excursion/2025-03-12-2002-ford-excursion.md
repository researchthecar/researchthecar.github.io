The 2002 Ford Excursion is a full-size SUV known for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and robust construction. It was available with several engine options: a 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque), a 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp and 425 lb-ft of torque), and a 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4R100 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Excursion's ability to haul large families and tow heavy loads, but some dislike its large size, poor fuel economy, and potential maintenance costs.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

* **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can seize in the cylinder head, causing the threads to strip when attempting removal. This can lead to misfires, poor performance, and eventually requiring cylinder head repair or replacement.
    * Solution: Use caution when removing spark plugs, especially if they haven't been changed in a while. Using a torque wrench when installing new plugs and applying anti-seize compound can help prevent future issues. If the threads are damaged, a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) can be used, or the cylinder head may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 for thread repair kit; $500 - $1500+ for cylinder head replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the intake manifold gasket area. This can cause overheating and low coolant levels.
    * Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

* **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    * Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can seize in the cylinder head, causing the threads to strip when attempting removal. This can lead to misfires, poor performance, and eventually requiring cylinder head repair or replacement.
    * Solution: Use caution when removing spark plugs, especially if they haven't been changed in a while.

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $150 for thread repair kit; $500 - $1500+ for cylinder head replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts can cause exhaust leaks, resulting in a ticking noise, reduced fuel economy, and potential damage to the exhaust manifold.
    * Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold bolts. This may require extracting the broken bolts, which can be difficult and time-consuming.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

* **Cam Position Sensor (CPS) Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall intermittently, run rough, or fail to start.
    * Solution: Replace the Cam Position Sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Injector O-Ring Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fuel or oil leaks into the engine oil, causing white smoke from the exhaust, fuel dilution of the oil, and rough running.
    * Solution: Replace the injector O-rings.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Reduced power, excessive smoke, and unusual noises from the turbocharger. Can be caused by worn bearings, leaking seals, or damaged vanes.
    * Solution: Rebuild or replace the turbocharger.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic**

* **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: The transmission may hesitate before shifting, shift roughly, or slip during gear changes.
    * Solution: Could be due to low fluid, worn solenoids, or internal damage. A fluid flush and filter change may help, but often a rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid flush; $2000 - $4000+ for rebuild or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at highway speeds, especially when accelerating. Can also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    * Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sags, especially when loaded. Broken leaf springs can cause instability and unsafe handling.
    * Solution: Replace the leaf springs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Ball Joint Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Front end noise (clunking or squeaking), loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Dimming lights, a dead battery, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    * Solution: Replace the alternator.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Instrument Cluster Issues**

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford Excursion is a capable vehicle, but like any older SUV, it has its share of potential problems. The 5.4L and 6.8L engines are prone to spark plug thread issues, while the 7.3L diesel can suffer from CPS and injector O-ring failures. Transmission issues like delayed shifting and torque converter failure are common. Suspension problems include sagging leaf springs and worn ball joints. Electrical issues like alternator and instrument cluster failures can occur. Rust is a concern, especially in areas with road salt, and interior issues like headliner sagging and power window motor failure are also possible. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as engine or transmission rebuilds, can be costly, making thorough inspection and maintenance crucial for Excursion owners.
