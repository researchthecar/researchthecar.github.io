The 2005 Ford Excursion is a full-size SUV known for its immense size, towing capacity, and ability to comfortably seat up to nine passengers. Aside from being only the sixth year of production for the Excursion, 2005 was the last year of production for this vehicle. Engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8 (310 hp, 365 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp, 425 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (325 hp, 560 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 5R110W TorqShift 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Excursion's spaciousness, ruggedness, and towing prowess, but often cite its poor fuel economy and difficult maneuverability as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can become seized in the cylinder head, leading to thread damage or complete failure when attempting to remove them for maintenance. This can result in misfires, rough idling, and potential engine damage. The issue is worsened by the two-piece spark plugs used in these engines.
    *   Solution: Use of penetrating oil and careful extraction techniques can sometimes prevent thread damage. If threads are damaged, repair kits or head replacement may be necessary. Replacing with one-piece spark plugs for the 2005 model can prevent future occurrences.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR cooler is prone to cracking and leaking coolant into the exhaust system or intake manifold. This can lead to white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and potentially hydro-locking the engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler with an updated or aftermarket version is the standard fix. Some owners opt to delete the EGR system entirely (where legal).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil cooler is located within the engine valley and is prone to clogging and leaking. This can cause elevated oil temperatures and insufficient lubrication, potentially leading to engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil cooler is the common solution. An upgraded oil cooler from Bullet Proof Diesel can reduce the likelihood of failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Injectors can fail due to stiction issues within the injector itself.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the injectors is the common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, the 6.8L can experience spark plug thread failure, making spark plug replacement difficult.
    *   Solution: Similar solutions as the 5.4L.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to slipping, shuddering, and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs are prone to sagging over time, leading to a decrease in ride height and towing capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs with new or aftermarket options. Adding airbags can also help maintain ride height when towing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of the ball joints, particularly in the front suspension. This can cause play in the steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Instrument cluster can fail, causing gauges to become inaccurate or stop working altogether.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **GEM Module Failure (Generic Electronic Module)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Controls various functions such as power windows, door locks, and wipers. Failure can cause erratic behavior in these systems.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the GEM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excursions are susceptible to rust, especially in areas exposed to road salt and moisture.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing rusted panels, followed by rustproofing measures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric can detach from the backing board, causing it to sag.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the headliner fabric or the entire headliner assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Ford Excursion, while a capable and spacious SUV, does suffer from a number of common issues. The 6.0L diesel engine is particularly prone to problems, with EGR cooler, oil cooler, and injector failures being frequent concerns. Spark plug thread failures can affect both the 5.4L V8 and 6.8L V10 engines. Other potential issues include transmission problems, suspension wear, electrical glitches, and rust. The cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the issue, ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major engine or transmission overhauls. These problems can make the vehicle difficult to own if you are not prepared for the maintenance that comes with it.
