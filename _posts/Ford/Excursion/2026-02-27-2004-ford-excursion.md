### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford Excursion, particularly with the gasoline V8 and V10 engines, demonstrates reasonable reliability for its class, with the most common significant issues being spark plug blowout and intake manifold leaks. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, however, is known for more complex and costly potential failures, including head gasket issues, EGR cooler problems, and oil cooler failures, which are critical to address. Transmission options appear robust. Electrical components like instrument clusters and window regulators can be points of failure. Overall, while the Excursion is a capable vehicle, potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine-related concerns, especially with the diesel variant, and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
