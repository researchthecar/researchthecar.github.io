**Summary**

The 2000 Ford Excursion, while a capable and spacious vehicle, is prone to certain issues due to its age and the wear and tear associated with heavy-duty use. Engine problems such as spark plug blowouts and glow plug relay failures can be costly to repair, and transmission issues can range from minor inconveniences to major overhauls. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are also common points of failure. Electrical problems, particularly with the GEM, can be frustrating and difficult to diagnose. Exterior rust and broken door handles are also common concerns. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly, as repairs can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on the severity.
