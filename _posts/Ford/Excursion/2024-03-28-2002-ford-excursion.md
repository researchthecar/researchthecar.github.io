**Introduction to the 2002 Ford Excursion**

The 2002 Ford Excursion is a full-size SUV built on the F-250 Super Duty platform. It was available with two engine options: a 5.4L V8 and a 7.3L Power Stroke V8 diesel. Both engines were mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Excursion was praised for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and off-road capabilities, but it was also criticized for its poor fuel economy.

  * Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

* **Injector O-Ring Failure:** The injector O-rings in the 7.3L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine can fail, leading to fuel leaks and poor engine performance.
  * Solution: Replace the injector O-rings.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
  * Recalls: None Found

* **High-Pressure Oil Pump Failure:** The high-pressure oil pump in the 7.3L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine can fail, causing a loss of oil pressure and catastrophic engine damage.
  * Solution: Replace the high-pressure oil pump.
  * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
  * Recalls: None Found
