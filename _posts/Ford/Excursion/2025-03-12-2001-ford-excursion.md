The 2001 Ford Excursion is a full-size SUV known for its immense size, towing capacity, and passenger space. Engine options include the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp and 425 lb-ft of torque), and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Excursion's ability to haul large families and tow heavy loads. Common complaints revolve around its size, fuel economy, and age-related maintenance issues.

**Summary**

The 2001 Ford Excursion is a capable but aging vehicle. The 5.4L and 6.8L engines are known for spark plug ejection issues, and the 7.3L diesel can suffer from cam sensor, glow plug, and injector problems. Transmission issues, especially torque converter and valve body failures, are common across all engine options. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs and ball joints, are prone to wear and tear. Electrical problems, such as instrument cluster and alternator failures, can also occur. Rust is a concern in areas with road salt. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, particularly engine and transmission work. The severity of these issues varies, but buyers should be prepared for potential maintenance and repairs due to the vehicle's age and mileage.
