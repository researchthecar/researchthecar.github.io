The 2003 Ford Excursion is a full-size SUV that was known for its immense size, towing capacity, and powerful engine options. Available engines included the 5.4L Triton V8 (260 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp, 425 lb-ft of torque), and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp, 525 lb-ft of torque, available only until mid-year). The transmissions were the 4R100 4-speed automatic. People appreciated the Excursion for its ability to comfortably transport large families and tow heavy loads. Some common complaints included poor fuel economy (especially with the V10), difficulty parking due to its size, and some reliability issues stemming from its age and heavy-duty components.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can become seized in the cylinder heads, leading to stripped threads or broken spark plugs during removal. This is often due to the design of the cylinder heads.
    *   Solution: Use penetrating oil before attempting removal. If threads are stripped, a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) can be used.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of plugs and repair method).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leaks, typically near the firewall, are indicated by hissing or ticking noises, especially when the engine is cold. This is due to warping or cracking of the exhaust manifold.

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford Excursion, while a capable and spacious SUV, suffers from issues common to vehicles of its age and heavy-duty design. Engine issues, such as spark plug thread damage and exhaust manifold leaks, are prevalent, particularly with the Triton V8 and V10 engines. The 7.3L Power Stroke Diesel can experience sensor and pump failures. Transmission problems are also common, often involving the torque converter and valve body. Suspension components wear out, leading to sagging and noise. Electrical issues like alternator and window motor failures occur. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in areas with road salt. Interior issues like headliner sagging and blend door actuator failure are also common. The severity and cost of these issues vary, with engine and transmission repairs potentially being the most expensive.
