The 2010 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust chassis and towing capabilities. It was offered with a few different engine options: a 5.4L Triton V8, a 6.8L Triton V10, and a 6.4L Power Stroke Diesel V8. The 6.4L Power Stroke Diesel V8, while powerful, is often cited as a source of several reliability concerns. For example, it produces 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. Owners often praise the F-550's workhorse capabilities and solid construction. Common complaints include high fuel consumption (especially with the V10 and diesel engines) and the complexity of the diesel engine's emissions system.

**Engine**

**6.4L Power Stroke Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, potential for engine overheating. The EGR cooler is prone to cracking and leaking, allowing coolant to enter the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty EGR cooler. Upgraded aftermarket EGR coolers are often recommended to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, white or black smoke from the exhaust, poor fuel economy, and potential for engine damage due to cylinder washdown (fuel entering the crankcase).
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace the faulty fuel injector(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ (depending on the number of injectors needing replacement and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, no starting, or stalling, especially when the engine is hot.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPOP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Lack of power, excessive black smoke, whistling noises, and potential for turbo failure. The 6.4L used a sequential turbo system, making it more complex than a single turbo setup.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the faulty turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ (depending on which turbocharger is affected and the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, and potential for spark plugs to break during removal due to their two-piece design.
    *   Solution: Carefully remove and replace the spark plugs. Anti-seize compound should be used on the new spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noises from the engine, especially when cold.
    *   Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold and gasket. Broken exhaust manifold studs are common.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise at startup, rough idle, loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam phasers, timing chains, and related components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Shifting Problems**

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford F-550 Super Duty, particularly when equipped with the 6.4L Power Stroke diesel, can be prone to some costly repairs. The EGR cooler, fuel injectors, and turbochargers are common problem areas on the diesel engine. The V10 and V8 engines aren't without issues, but they are generally less problematic than the diesel. Suspension and electrical issues are typical of a heavy-duty truck of this age. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic. The severity and cost of the issues can range from minor inconveniences to major expenses.
