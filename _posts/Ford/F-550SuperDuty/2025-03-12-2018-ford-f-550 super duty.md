The 2018 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty truck known for its impressive towing and payload capabilities, primarily used for commercial purposes. Engine options include the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine, the 6.2L gasoline Boss engine, and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 turbo diesel engine. The 6.8L V10 produces 288 horsepower and 424 lb-ft of torque. The 6.2L produces 385 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque. The 6.7L diesel produces 450 horsepower and 935 lb-ft of torque. The 6.2L and 6.8L are paired with the TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.7L diesel is paired with the TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the F-550's robust build, workhorse capabilities, and comfortable cabin, but often cite high fuel consumption and the cost of maintenance as downsides.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 fuel pump is known to fail due to inadequate lubrication for American fuel. When it fails, it sends metal shavings throughout the entire fuel system, contaminating the injectors, fuel rails, and potentially damaging the engine. Symptoms include hard starting, rough running, check engine light, and eventual engine stall.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 fuel pump, fuel injectors, fuel rails, fuel lines, and thoroughly clean the fuel tank. Some owners opt for a CP3 conversion kit, which replaces the CP4 with a more reliable CP3 pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system, including the DEF pump, DEF injector, and NOx sensors, are fairly common. Symptoms include a check engine light, reduced engine power, and messages related to DEF fluid levels or quality.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis is key to pinpoint the faulty component. Replacement of the DEF pump, injector, or NOx sensors may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Turbocharger failure can manifest as a loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, whistling noises from the engine bay, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect the oil supply lines for any blockages.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10 Gasoline**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.8L V10 can be prone to spark plugs ejecting from the cylinder heads. This is because of limited thread engagement. The spark plug will fly out of the cylinder head, damaging the coil pack and spark plug.
    *   Solution: Repair the threads in the cylinder head using a thread repair kit or insert. Then, replace the spark plug and coil pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1,000+, depending on the shop rate and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L Gasoline Boss Engine**
*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-speed Automatic Transmission (6.7L Diesel, 6.2L Gasoline, 6.8L Gasoline)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter shudder, slipping during acceleration, and abnormal noises are common symptoms of torque converter failure. This can be caused by overheating and contaminated transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission. In some cases, a full transmission rebuild may be necessary if debris has circulated throughout the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Transmission slipping, where the engine revs up but the vehicle doesn't accelerate properly, can also occur. These issues may be more pronounced when towing or hauling heavy loads.
    *   Solution: A diagnostic scan can help identify potential causes, such as faulty shift solenoids, valve body issues, or internal wear. Depending on the cause, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $5,000+ depending on the severity and required repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy-duty nature of the F-550, the rear leaf springs can be prone to sagging or even cracking over time, especially with frequent heavy loads. This can lead to a rough ride, reduced load capacity, and potential handling issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn or damaged leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is consistently used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per axle depending on the springs and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of excessive battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, are not uncommon. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including parasitic draws from aftermarket accessories, faulty modules, or a failing alternator.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the source of the battery drain using a multimeter and electrical diagrams. Repair or replace the faulty component. Check the alternator output to ensure it's properly charging the battery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the vehicle, such as ABS sensors, TPMS sensors, and engine sensors, can fail or malfunction, triggering warning lights and potentially affecting vehicle performance.
    *   Solution: Identify the faulty sensor using a diagnostic scan tool and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion/Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Depending on the environment where the truck is operated, corrosion or rust can develop, particularly on the frame, underbody, and body panels.
    *   Solution: Treat affected areas with rust inhibitors and paint. For severe cases, panel replacement or welding may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $5,000+ depending on the extent of the corrosion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the HVAC system, such as weak airflow, inconsistent temperature, or a malfunctioning blower motor, can occur.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the issue by checking the blower motor, resistor, blend door actuator, and refrigerant levels. Replace any faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2018 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a capable work truck, but it is prone to certain issues. The most concerning are the CP4 high-pressure fuel pump failure in the 6.7L diesel engine, which can lead to costly repairs, and potential torque converter issues in the transmission. Suspension and electrical problems also appear frequently. While some issues are relatively minor, others can be very expensive to repair, making it important for prospective buyers to have a thorough pre-purchase inspection performed, paying close attention to the fuel system, transmission, and suspension components.
