The 2004 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. Engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 6.0L diesel produced 325 horsepower and 570 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praised the F-550 for its reliability and sheer power, making it a favorite for commercial use. Common complaints centered around fuel economy, particularly with the V10, and the reliability of the 6.0L diesel engine, which was notorious for issues.

**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, white smoke from exhaust, overheating. EGR cooler failure can lead to coolant entering the engine and causing hydrolock or head gasket failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an upgraded or bulletproofed aftermarket version. Consider deleting the EGR system altogether (check local laws regarding emissions).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, white smoke from exhaust, coolant loss, bubbling in the coolant reservoir, and a characteristic "sweet" smell from the exhaust. Often caused by over-torquing the head bolts at the factory.
    *   Solution: Replace head gaskets, often with upgraded ARP head studs to prevent future failures. Surface the cylinder heads to ensure proper sealing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, excessive smoke, reduced power, and poor fuel economy. Sticking or leaking injectors are common.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty injectors. Ensure proper fuel filtration to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per injector (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbo, reduced power, excessive smoke (black or blue), and potential for engine damage if the turbo fails catastrophically.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect the oil supply line to the turbo for restrictions.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden loud popping noise, misfire, and loss of power. The spark plug threads in the aluminum cylinder heads are prone to stripping.
    *   Solution: Repair the spark plug threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert). Avoid over-torquing spark plugs during future replacements.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per cylinder (depending on the repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noise, especially when the engine is cold. Broken exhaust manifold bolts are a common cause.
    *   Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold and broken bolts. Use anti-seize compound on the new bolts to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden loud popping noise, misfire, and loss of power. The spark plug threads in the aluminum cylinder heads are prone to stripping.

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and harsh shifts between gears, especially from 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd. Can be caused by worn valve body components or solenoid issues.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Replace faulty solenoids. Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, slipping during acceleration, and/or a whining noise.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Inspect the transmission for internal damage and address any issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

**Summary**
The 2004 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a powerful truck with common issues that vary in severity and cost. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine has the most significant potential for costly repairs, particularly head gasket and EGR cooler failures. The Triton V10 and V8 engines can suffer from spark plug blowout, which is generally a less expensive fix but requires prompt attention. Suspension wear is common due to the heavy-duty nature of the vehicle. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the truck's maintenance history, especially regarding the engine and transmission, and budget for potential repairs.
