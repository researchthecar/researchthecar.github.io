**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Symptoms include rough running, misfires, excessive smoke (white or black), reduced power, and potentially engine knocking. This can be due to a faulty injector solenoid, clogged injector nozzle, or internal injector damage.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis typically involves using a scan tool to identify the faulty injector and performing an injector cutout test. Replacement of the faulty injector is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ (depending on the shop rate and number of injectors needing replacement, injector brand)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, excessive white smoke on startup, and a rough idle, especially in cold weather. A failed glow plug can also trigger the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty glow plug(s) using a multimeter or scan tool. Replace the defective glow plug(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (depending on the shop rate, number of glow plugs needing replacement and if the glow plug is broken and stuck in the cylinder head)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Common issue with the 6.8L V10, the aluminum cylinder heads can have weak spark plug threads. During spark plug changes, the threads can strip easily or spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads using a thread repair kit like a Time-Sert or installing a helicoil. In severe cases, cylinder head replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the repair method and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Audible exhaust leak, especially during cold starts. Decreased fuel economy and performance. The leak is typically caused by cracked manifolds or broken exhaust manifold bolts.
    *   Solution: Replace the damaged exhaust manifold and any broken bolts. Ensure proper torque during installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ (depending on the shop rate and if the bolts break during removal)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, or a noticeable delay when shifting into drive or reverse. This can be caused by valve body issues, worn clutches, or solenoid problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the transmission using a scan tool. Valve body replacement, transmission rebuild, or replacement of solenoids may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $4,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or vibrating sensation, especially at lower speeds or under light acceleration. Often caused by a worn or failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission flush and fluid replacement may temporarily alleviate the symptoms, but replacement is usually necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (depending on the shop rate and if the transmission needs to be removed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, especially when loaded. Cracking or breakage of leaf springs, leading to a rough ride and potential handling issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs may be recommended for vehicles frequently used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per axle (depending on the shop rate and quality of replacement springs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rods**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, excessive tire wear, and clunking noises from the front end. Play in the ball joints or tie rod ends can be felt during inspection.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends. An alignment is necessary after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle (depending on the shop rate and parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (ABS, Wheel Speed)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light illumination, traction control issues, and potential loss of ABS functionality. Diagnostic trouble codes indicating faulty ABS or wheel speed sensors.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor. Ensure proper installation and wiring connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (depending on the shop rate and sensor location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, battery warning light, and eventual loss of electrical power. Voltage output below the normal range when tested with a multimeter.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty alternator. Ensure proper belt tension and wiring connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ (depending on the shop rate and alternator type)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion (Frame/Undercarriage)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts. This is more prevalent in areas with heavy road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and applying rust-inhibiting coatings. In severe cases, welding repairs or frame replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $5,000+ (depending on the severity of the corrosion and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford F-550 Super Duty, while a capable work truck, is not without its issues. Engine problems, particularly with the fuel injectors and spark plug threads, and transmission problems, with harsh shifting and torque converter shudder, can be costly to repair. Suspension issues like sagging leaf springs and electrical problems like sensor failures are also common. Frame corrosion can be a significant issue in certain climates. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can run into the thousands of dollars, reflecting the heavy-duty nature and complexity of the vehicle. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the truck, especially the undercarriage and engine, and obtain a pre-purchase inspection to identify potential problems.
