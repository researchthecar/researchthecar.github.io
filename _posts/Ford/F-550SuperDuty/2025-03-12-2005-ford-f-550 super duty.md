The 2005 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. Owners appreciate its solid build and commercial applications, but some dislike its rough ride and dated interior. Engine options include the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 6.0L Power Stroke Diesel produces 325 horsepower and 570 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options typically include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine. Common complaints revolve around reliability issues with the 6.0L diesel engine, electrical problems, and some suspension components.
