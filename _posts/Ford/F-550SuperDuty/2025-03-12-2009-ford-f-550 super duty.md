The 2009 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. Engine options for this year include the 6.4L Power Stroke diesel V8, which produces 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine, which produces 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are typically paired with a 5-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the F-550 for its raw power and ability to handle demanding tasks, but some common complaints revolve around fuel economy, maintenance costs associated with the diesel engine, and overall ride quality.
