The 2001 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust chassis and hauling capabilities. Engine options for this model year included the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8, a powerhouse producing 275 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque, the 6.8L Triton V10 producing 310 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque and the 5.4L Triton V8 producing 235 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque.

**Summary**

The 2001 Ford F-550 Super Duty, while a capable workhorse, is subject to age-related issues. The 7.3L Power Stroke, though revered, can suffer injector issues. The spark plug blowout issue is common on both the 6.8L and 5.4L engines. Transmission problems in the 4R100 include torque converter and valve body failures. Suspension components such as leaf springs and ball joints are prone to wear. Electrical problems, rust, and interior wear are also common. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like sensor replacements to more substantial expenses for engine, transmission, or body work. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect any 2001 F-550 for these common issues before purchase.
