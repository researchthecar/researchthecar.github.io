The 2006 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty truck built for demanding commercial applications. Engine options included the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel V8, a problematic but powerful engine, and the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine. The 6.0L Power Stroke produced 325 horsepower and 570 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions were the 5R110W TorqShift 5-speed automatic. Owners often praised the F-550 for its towing capacity and workhorse capabilities. Common complaints included the reliability of the 6.0L diesel engine and the overall cost of maintenance.

**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler is prone to cracking and leaking coolant into the engine. Symptoms include coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler with an updated design, sometimes coupled with EGR valve replacement and coolant flush.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil cooler, located within the engine valley, is prone to clogging and leaking. Clogging restricts oil flow, leading to high oil temperatures. Leaking introduces oil into the coolant system.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil cooler and often a coolant flush to remove residual oil.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.0L Power Stroke is known for injector failures. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, white or black smoke, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Injector replacement. It is often recommended to replace all injectors at once when one fails to ensure consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per injector (parts + labor), $1500 - $3000+ for full set.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The head bolts in the 6.0L Power Stroke are prone to stretching, leading to head gasket failure. Symptoms include coolant loss, white smoke, excessive pressure in the cooling system, and engine overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the head gaskets, typically with upgraded head studs to prevent future failures. Often includes machining of the head to ensure it is flat.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Ejection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The cylinder heads have shallow spark plug threads which can lead to spark plugs ejecting from the head. This results in a loud popping noise, misfire, and loss of power.
    *   Solution: Repairing the cylinder head by installing a thread insert kit or replacing the entire cylinder head. Using anti-seize compound on the spark plug threads is recommended during installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (thread repair), $1500 - $3000+ (head replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering, slipping, and difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. It is often recommended to flush the transmission fluid and replace the filter when doing so.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or erratic shifting, especially between certain gears. This can be caused by valve body issues or solenoid failures.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body, solenoid replacement, or complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ (valve body/solenoid), $3000 - $6000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs, especially in the rear, are prone to sagging or cracking under heavy loads. This can lead to poor ride quality, reduced load capacity, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Upgraded or heavy-duty leaf springs may be considered for improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ball joints wear prematurely, especially with heavy use. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front end, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **FICM (Fuel Injection Control Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The FICM controls the fuel injectors in the 6.0L diesel. Failure can cause hard starting, stalling, rough running, and a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replacement or repair of the FICM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: High electrical demands can lead to premature alternator failure. Symptoms include dimming lights, a dead battery, and warning lights.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Cab Corners/Rocker Panels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is common, especially in areas with road salt exposure, particularly in the cab corners and rocker panels.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involving cutting out the affected areas and welding in new metal, followed by bodywork and painting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per area (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Frame Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat frames can develop cracks, especially in high-wear areas, leading to instability and discomfort.
    *   Solution: Welding and reinforcing the cracked frame or seat frame replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a capable work truck, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine. Engine-related issues (EGR cooler, oil cooler, injectors, head gaskets) can be very costly to repair. Transmission and suspension issues are also prevalent. Electrical problems, like FICM failures, can also be costly. Rust can be a major concern. Addressing these issues proactively or seeking a well-maintained example can help avoid significant repair bills. The potential cost to address these issues range from a few hundred dollars for smaller fixes to several thousands of dollars for major engine or transmission repairs.
