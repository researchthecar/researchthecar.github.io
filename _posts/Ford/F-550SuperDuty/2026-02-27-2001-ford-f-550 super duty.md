### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a capable work truck with a generally solid reputation for durability, particularly the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel engine. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as ICP sensor failures, EGR valve sticking, and turbocharger wear on the diesel. Gasoline engines (5.4L and 6.8L V8s) can experience spark plug blowout and sensor issues. Automatic transmissions (4R100) may develop torque converter or solenoid pack problems. Manual transmissions are more robust but clutch wear is a common maintenance item. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can be stressed under heavy loads. Electrical issues like alternator failure and wiring harness problems are not uncommon. Rust can be a significant concern in corrosive environments. Overall, with diligent maintenance and prompt attention to reported issues, the F-550 can remain a reliable asset for demanding tasks.
