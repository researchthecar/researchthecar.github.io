The 2003 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse reliability. Engine options for this year included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (early year) / 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (later year). The 7.3L Power Stroke produced around 275 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque, while the 6.0L produced 325 horsepower and 560 lb-ft of torque. Owners often appreciate the F-550's hauling and towing capacity, but some common complaints include the ride quality and the cost of maintaining such a large vehicle, especially diesel models.

**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, rough running engine. EGR cooler ruptures causing coolant to enter the intake manifold, potentially leading to hydrolock and engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace EGR cooler with an updated or aftermarket version designed for better durability. Coolant flush and inspection for further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, lack of power, excessive smoke. Sticking or failing fuel injectors lead to improper fuel delivery.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. Diagnose and repair any related wiring or harness issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, bubbling in the coolant reservoir. The 6.0L is known for head gasket failure due to head bolt stretch.
    *   Solution: Replace head gaskets with upgraded gaskets and head studs to prevent future failure. Machine heads for proper surface finish.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **Cam Position Sensor (CPS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden stalling, rough running, no-start condition. The CPS provides critical engine timing information to the PCM.
    *   Solution: Replace the CPS. It's advisable to carry a spare.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Relay (GPR) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke on startup. The GPR provides power to the glow plugs to preheat the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replace the GPR.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plug ejection from cylinder head, loud ticking noise, misfire. The 5.4L 2V and 3V engines have a reputation for weak spark plug threads.
    *   Solution: Repair the cylinder head spark plug threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (per cylinder)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracks**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 (Generally Paired with 7.3L Diesel and V10)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping between gears, complete loss of drive. The torque converter can wear out or fail, preventing proper power transfer.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Flush the transmission cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a capable truck, but like any older vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The 6.0L Power Stroke engine, in particular, is known for costly problems like EGR cooler and head gasket failures. The 7.3L is generally more reliable, but still susceptible to typical wear and tear issues. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs to the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Repair costs can vary widely depending on the severity of the problem and the chosen repair method, but some of the most significant issues can easily cost several thousand dollars to address.
