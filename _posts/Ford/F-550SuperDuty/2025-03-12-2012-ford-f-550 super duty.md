The 2012 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust capabilities and dependability. It was offered with a 6.2L 2-Valve SOHC EFI V8 gasoline engine (385 hp and 405 lb-ft of torque) and a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel engine (400 hp and 800 lb-ft of torque). Both engines came standard with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the F-550's immense towing and payload capacity, its strong diesel engine option, and its work-ready features. Common dislikes include the firm ride quality, high fuel consumption, and the overall cost of maintenance and repairs associated with a heavy-duty truck.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult cold starts, excessive white smoke upon starting, engine misfires at low RPM. Often, a check engine light will illuminate with codes relating to glow plug circuit malfunctions (e.g., P0670, P0671-P0678).
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plug(s). It's recommended to replace all glow plugs at the same time for even performance and to minimize future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ (depending on how many are replaced and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, engine misfires, reduced power, black smoke from the exhaust, and potential fuel dilution of the engine oil. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) relating to fuel injector performance (e.g., P0201-P0208) will likely be present.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific faulty injector and replace it. It's crucial to ensure proper installation and calibration of the new injector.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector (includes parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, reduced power, illuminated "Exhaust Filter Full" message, and potential for engine damage if ignored. Codes related to DPF pressure or efficiency are common.
    *   Solution: Attempt a forced regeneration cycle. If that fails, the DPF may need to be cleaned or replaced. Investigate potential causes of excessive soot buildup, such as faulty injectors or turbocharger issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 for cleaning, $1500 - $3000+ for replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L 2-Valve SOHC EFI V8 Gasoline**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idle, reduced acceleration, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the spark plugs. Ensure the correct spark plug gap and torque specifications are followed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R140 (6-Speed Automatic) - Both Engine Options**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, poor fuel economy, and potential stalling. Can also trigger transmission-related trouble codes.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's recommended to flush the transmission fluid and inspect for debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ (includes torque converter, fluid, and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, and difficulty engaging certain gears. Can also lead to a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. In some cases, cleaning and inspecting the valve body can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging, particularly in the rear, reduced ride height, and potential for bottoming out under heavy loads. Squeaking noises from the suspension are also common.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side (depending on leaf spring type and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering on the road, clunking noises from the front suspension, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. It's recommended to replace ball joints in pairs (both upper or both lower) to ensure even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per pair (depending on ball joint type and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, battery warning light illumination, difficulty starting the engine, and eventually, complete electrical failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator. Ensure the replacement alternator is properly rated for the vehicle's electrical demands.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ (includes alternator and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Chafing/Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as malfunctioning lights, sensors, or accessories. Can be difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Inspect the wiring harnesses for signs of chafing or corrosion. Repair or replace damaged sections of the harness. Apply dielectric grease to connections to prevent future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Northern Climates)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the body panels, frame, and undercarriage. Particularly prevalent in areas that use road salt.
    *   Solution: Address rust promptly to prevent further damage. Sand down rust, apply rust converter, and repaint. Undercoat the vehicle to protect against future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent or no heat/AC, clicking noises behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a capable work truck, but like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, particularly fuel injector and DPF problems. The 6-speed automatic transmission can also experience torque converter and valve body issues. Suspension and electrical problems are also present. Costs of these repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for more extensive work. Rust is also a potential problem, especially in regions where road salt is used. Potential buyers should have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a qualified mechanic before purchase.
