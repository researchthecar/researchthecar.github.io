The 2019 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty chassis cab truck designed for commercial applications, often used for ambulances, tow trucks, and utility vehicles. Engine options include the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine producing 288 horsepower and 424 lb-ft of torque, the 6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 engine producing 385 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel engine producing 330 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with the TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the F-550's robust capabilities and towing capacity, while some dislike its stiff ride and high operating costs.

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford F-550 Super Duty, while a capable workhorse, is subject to a range of issues primarily revolving around its diesel engine and transmission. The 6.7L Power Stroke is prone to fuel injector and EGR valve failures, as well as DPF clogging, all of which can be costly to repair. The TorqShift 6-speed transmission can experience harsh shifting and torque converter issues. Other concerns include suspension wear and electrical problems. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, engine and transmission repairs can quickly escalate to significant costs. Potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase, paying particular attention to maintenance records and diagnostic reports.
