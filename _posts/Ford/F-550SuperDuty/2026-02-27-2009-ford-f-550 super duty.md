### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford F-550 Super Duty demonstrates solid reliability, especially for its intended heavy-duty use. The 6.4L Power Stroke diesel engine, while powerful, has documented issues with its EGR cooler, turbochargers, and fuel injectors that can be costly to repair. The gasoline V8 engines (5.4L and 6.8L) are generally reliable but can be prone to spark plug blowout. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 5R110W, may experience torque converter or solenoid pack problems. Manual transmissions and other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are generally considered reliable with no widespread common failures reported beyond normal wear and tear. Regular maintenance and addressing potential diesel-specific issues proactively are key to long-term dependability.
