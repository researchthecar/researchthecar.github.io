### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a capable workhorse with a generally solid reputation for reliability in its class. The 7.3L Power Stroke diesel is a well-regarded engine, though it can experience issues with sensors and glow plugs. Gasoline V8s, particularly the 5.4L and 6.8L, are prone to spark plug blowout and IMRC problems. Automatic transmissions like the 4R100 can develop torque converter or internal gear issues, while manual transmissions may require clutch or synchronizer replacements. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can be subject to wear and breakage under heavy use. Electrical issues like alternator failure and wiring corrosion are not uncommon with age. Overall, while not immune to problems, the F-550's issues are often related to its heavy-duty nature and age, with many repairs being manageable for commercial operators.
