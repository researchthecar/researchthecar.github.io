### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford F-550 Super Duty, particularly models equipped with the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel, generally exhibits good reliability for its class. However, the introduction of the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel brought a higher incidence of complex and costly issues, primarily related to the oil cooler, HPOP, and EGR system. Transmission reliability is generally solid, with the 4R100 being robust and the 5R110W having some specific solenoid issues. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical gremlins can occur, often related to wiring integrity. Overall, while the 7.3L diesel is a strong performer, potential buyers should be cautious of the 6.0L diesel and be prepared for potential maintenance on its known weak points.
