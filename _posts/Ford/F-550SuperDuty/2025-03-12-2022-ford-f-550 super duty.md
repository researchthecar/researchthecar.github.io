Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2022 Ford F-550 Super Duty, categorized by component and with details on symptoms, solutions, and estimated costs. This information is based on available data and owner reports. Keep in mind that individual experiences may vary.

The 2022 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. It's commonly used in commercial applications. Engine options include the 7.3L "Godzilla" gasoline V8, producing 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.7L "Power Stroke" turbo-diesel V8, which delivers 330 horsepower and 825 lb-ft of torque. The F-550 generally receives positive reviews for its power, ruggedness, and ability to handle demanding tasks. Criticisms often center around ride quality (inherent to heavy-duty trucks), fuel economy (particularly with the gasoline engine), and high purchase price. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke Turbo-Diesel V8**

*   **High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden engine stall, inability to start, metallic debris in the fuel system. This is often related to fuel contamination. The CP4.2 pump design used in some years is known to be susceptible to failure when contaminated fuel is used.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and fuel tank cleaning. In some cases, the entire fuel system needs replacement. Some owners opt for a CP3 conversion kit to replace the CP4.2 pump with a more robust design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and if CP3 conversion is done).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Check Engine" light illuminated, DEF level sensor malfunction, DEF injector clogging, poor engine performance, and error messages related to DEF system faults.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the specific DEF system component causing the issue (sensor, injector, pump). Replacement of faulty components, DEF system cleaning, and software updates.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ (depending on the component).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L "Godzilla" Gasoline V8**

*   **Valve Train Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noise from the engine, particularly noticeable at idle or low speeds. The noise can stem from valvetrain components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of valvetrain, inspection of roller rockers and lifters, replacement of faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity and parts needing replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears. Hesitation or delay when shifting. Clunking noises during shifts. Can be more noticeable when towing or under heavy load.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) often resolve these issues. In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for software updates; $800 - $2,000+ for valve body replacement; $3,000 - $7,000+ for transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vibration or shuddering felt at highway speeds, particularly when the transmission is in overdrive and under light load.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and replacement with updated fluid. In some cases, torque converter replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for fluid flush; $800 - $2,000+ for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loud squeaking noises coming from the leaf springs, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. This is more common in trucks that frequently carry heavy loads.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring bushings and contact points. Replacing worn or damaged bushings. In severe cases, leaf spring replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for lubrication; $200 - $800 for bushing replacement; $500 - $2,000+ for leaf spring replacement (per spring).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC infotainment system freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the SYNC system. Performing a system reset. In some cases, replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100 for software updates; $500 - $1,500+ for APIM replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a short period of time, leading to difficulty starting the truck. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from an electrical component that is not shutting off properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic drain using a multimeter. Disconnecting aftermarket accessories. Replacing faulty electrical components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the source of the drain).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Side Mirror Issues**
