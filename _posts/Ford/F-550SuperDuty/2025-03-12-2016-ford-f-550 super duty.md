The 2016 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust capabilities and commercial applications. It's often praised for its towing capacity, payload capacity, and overall durability. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues. Available engine options include the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 turbo diesel. The 6.8L V10 produces 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. The 6.7L Power Stroke Diesel produces 440 horsepower and 860 lb-ft of torque. The 2016 F-550 is generally well-received for its capability, but some common dislikes include its ride quality (stiff due to its heavy-duty nature), fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), and general cost of ownership/maintenance.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 high-pressure fuel pump is known for potential failures, especially when contaminated with low-quality fuel. Symptoms include engine stalling, rough running, difficulty starting, and metal shavings found in the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replace the CP4 fuel pump and thoroughly clean the entire fuel system to remove any contaminants. Some owners opt to replace it with a more robust aftermarket pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $10,000+ depending on the extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the DEF system, including faulty sensors, clogged injectors, or issues with the DEF fluid itself. This can cause the engine to go into limp mode, reduce power, and trigger warning lights.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component failing (sensor, injector, etc.) and replace it. Flush the DEF system if contamination is suspected.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can fail due to oil starvation, overheating, or general wear and tear. Symptoms include loss of power, excessive smoke, and unusual noises from the turbocharger area.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger and address any underlying issues (e.g., oil leaks) that contributed to the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Ejection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Certain years of the Triton V10 are known for spark plugs ejecting from the cylinder head due to insufficient thread engagement. This results in a loud popping noise, engine misfire, and potential damage to the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head. Time-Sert inserts can be used to repair the threads in the existing head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the repair method and extent of damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold bolts can break, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking noise, reduced fuel economy, and a smell of exhaust fumes in the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken manifold bolts and/or the entire exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/ Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh shifting between gears, especially when cold, or slipping during acceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM) may help. In other cases, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced if the problem stems from worn internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (reprogramming) - $5,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can experience issues such as shuddering, vibration, or failure to lock up properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy-duty nature of the F-550, the leaf springs can sag or even break over time, especially when consistently used for heavy loads. This can lead to a reduced ride height, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if consistently hauling heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ per axle depending on the springs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with various sensors, including those related to the engine, transmission, and emissions systems. This can lead to warning lights, poor performance, and difficulty diagnosing the root cause.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor failing and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor depending on the location and type.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Unexplained battery drain, especially when the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by parasitic draw from various electrical components.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various circuits and components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion/Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can form on the undercarriage and body panels, especially in areas exposed to road salt.
    *   Solution: Treat the rust and apply rust-resistant coatings. Replace affected panels if the rust is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and location of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with the heating and air conditioning system, such as weak airflow, failure to blow hot or cold air, or unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific component failing (blower motor, compressor, blend door actuator, etc.) and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford F-550 Super Duty, while a capable work truck, can be prone to several issues. The most serious and costly problems tend to be related to the 6.7L Power Stroke Diesel engine, particularly the CP4 fuel pump failure. The 6.8L V10 engine spark plug ejection is also a serious concern that can result in costly repairs. Other issues, such as transmission problems, suspension wear, and electrical issues, are relatively common for a vehicle of this type and mileage. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs. It is highly recommended to have a qualified mechanic perform a thorough inspection of the vehicle before purchase, paying particular attention to the fuel system, engine, and transmission.
