The 2007 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty truck built for demanding work applications. It was offered with several engine options, including the 5.4L Triton V8 (300 hp, 365 lb-ft torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (362 hp, 457 lb-ft torque), and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (325 hp, 570 lb-ft torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the F-550 for its capability, payload capacity, and towing prowess. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the gas engines), some reliability issues, and the stiff ride quality when unladen.
