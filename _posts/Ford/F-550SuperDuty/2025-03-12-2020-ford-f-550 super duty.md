Engine options include the 6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 (385 hp and 430 lb-ft of torque), the 7.3L 2V DEVCT NA PFI V8 (350 hp and 468 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel (330 hp and 825 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the F-550's payload and towing capacity, as well as its durability. Some common dislikes include ride quality when unloaded and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, excessive smoke, decreased fuel economy, possible engine damage.
    * Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. May require additional diagnostics to determine root cause (e.g., fuel contamination).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+ depending on the number of injectors replaced and shop labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Frequent regeneration cycles, "Check Engine" light, reduced engine power, potential for DPF clogging. Can be related to issues with the DEF system.
    * Solution: Diagnosing the root cause is critical. Could involve cleaning or replacing the DPF, addressing DEF system problems, or repairing other engine components affecting combustion.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the repair needed. DPF replacement can be costly.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke on startup, engine misfires.
    * Solution: Replace the faulty glow plug(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the number of glow plugs replaced and shop labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

**7.3L 2V DEVCT NA PFI V8**

*No Issues Found*

**6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**10-Speed TorqShift Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh or Erratic Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, especially at lower speeds, and occasional slipping.
    * Solution: Perform a transmission service and re-flash the transmission control module (TCM) with the latest software. If issues persist, valve body inspection and possible replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ depending on the severity of the issue. Software updates are generally inexpensive, while valve body replacement can be more substantial.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine revs high without corresponding acceleration, delayed engagement of gears.
    * Solution: Diagnose the cause of the slipping, which could range from low fluid level to internal component wear. A transmission rebuild or replacement might be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and the repair approach (rebuild vs. replace).
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Sagging leaf springs, especially when loaded, leading to reduced ride height and handling issues. Broken or cracked leaves.
    * Solution: Replace worn or damaged leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty springs if the vehicle is consistently used for heavy loads.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per axle, depending on the type of leaf spring and labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Battery draining overnight or within a short period, requiring frequent jump starts or battery replacement.
    * Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty modules, and wiring issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue and the component responsible for the drain.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Failures (e.g., ABS, TPMS)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Warning lights illuminated on the dashboard, indicating a malfunctioning sensor. May impact vehicle performance or safety systems.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor causing the issue and replace it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per sensor, depending on the type of sensor and accessibility.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Corrosion Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust formation, particularly in areas prone to salt exposure (e.g., wheel wells, frame).
    * Solution: Remove rust, treat the affected areas with rust inhibitors, and apply protective coatings. Regular washing and undercoating can help prevent future corrosion.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the rust and the repair methods used. Frame repair can be very costly.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **HVAC Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning air conditioning or heating, inconsistent temperature control, blower motor issues.
    * Solution: Diagnose the specific HVAC component causing the problem (e.g., compressor, condenser, blower motor, blend door actuator) and repair or replace it.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500+ depending on the complexity of the repair and the parts required.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford F-550 Super Duty, while a capable and robust vehicle, is susceptible to certain issues. The most significant concerns center around the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine and the 10-speed automatic transmission. Engine issues like injector failure and DPF problems can be expensive to repair. Suspension, electrical, exterior (corrosion), and interior (HVAC) issues are also observed. Overall, while the F-550 is a reliable workhorse, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and budget accordingly for maintenance and repairs. The severity and cost of repairs can vary greatly depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage. Potential buyers should prioritize thorough inspections and maintenance records.
