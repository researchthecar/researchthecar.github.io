### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a capable workhorse, but its reliability is heavily influenced by the chosen powertrain. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, while powerful, is known for several significant and costly potential failures, including EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head gasket issues. The 6.8L V10 has fewer critical issues, with spark plug blowout being the most notable. The 5R110W automatic transmission can experience torque converter and solenoid pack problems. Manual transmissions are generally more robust. Electrical systems can suffer from wiring harness issues and alternator failures. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are generally considered reliable for this model year. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection of known weak points, especially on the 6.0L diesel, are crucial for long-term dependability.
