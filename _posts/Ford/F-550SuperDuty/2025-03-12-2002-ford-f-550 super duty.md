The 2002 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck built for demanding tasks. Available engine options included the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp, 525 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 5.4L Triton V8. Transmission options were primarily the 4R100 4-speed automatic and a ZF5 or ZF6 manual transmission, depending on the engine and year. Owners often praised its towing capacity and durability. However, the age of these trucks means common complaints revolve around maintenance needs, especially with the diesel engine, and rust. Dislikes often include fuel economy and ride quality, which is typical for a heavy-duty truck.

**Engine**

**7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **Injector Driver Module (IDM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The IDM controls the fuel injectors. When it fails, the engine may run rough, misfire, or not start at all. The check engine light may illuminate, and diagnostic codes related to injector circuits will be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty IDM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Position Sensor (CPS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall intermittently, especially when hot. The tachometer may also fluctuate erratically.
    *   Solution: Replace the CPS. It's often recommended to keep a spare on hand.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Back Pressure Valve (EBPV) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EBPV is designed to help the engine warm up in cold weather. Issues include valve sticking, causing poor performance, excessive exhaust back pressure, and unusual noise.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EBPV. Some owners choose to delete it entirely.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head, damaging the threads. This results in a loud popping noise, a significant loss of power, and a misfire.
    *   Solution: Repair the cylinder head threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold studs can cause exhaust leaks, resulting in a ticking noise, reduced fuel economy, and potential damage to other engine components.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken studs and/or the exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as the 6.8L Triton V10, spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head, damaging the threads.
    *   Solution: Repair the cylinder head threads or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as the 6.8L Triton V10, broken exhaust manifold studs can cause exhaust leaks.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Delayed or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may hesitate before shifting gears or shift with a hard jolt. This can be caused by worn valve body components, low fluid level, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission service (fluid and filter change), repair or replace the valve body, or rebuild the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (service) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Symptoms include shuddering at low speeds, especially under load, and poor acceleration. Debris from the torque converter can contaminate the transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford F-550 Super Duty is a capable work truck but, due to its age, requires diligent maintenance. Common issues range from engine-specific problems like the 7.3L's IDM and CPS failures, and the Triton engine's spark plug issues to transmission problems and suspension wear. Electrical issues and rust are also prevalent. Repair costs can vary significantly, from relatively inexpensive sensor replacements to costly engine or transmission rebuilds. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect any prospective vehicle for these issues and budget accordingly for necessary repairs.
