The 2019 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a popular choice for cutaway vans and chassis cabs, frequently used for ambulances, shuttle buses, and recreational vehicles. It's generally appreciated for its robust build, payload capacity, and reliability, particularly in demanding commercial applications. However, some owners have reported issues. The E-450 came standard with a 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine, producing 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (TorqShift 6). A 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine may have been an available option, paired with the same 6-speed automatic transmission, although it was more commonly found on the F-Series trucks. Potential dislikes include its fuel economy, ride quality, and dated interior compared to newer models.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.8L Triton V10 engine is known for spark plug threads stripping in the cylinder head, potentially causing spark plug ejection. This usually occurs during spark plug replacement, or sometimes due to engine vibrations over time.
    *   Solution: Thread repair kits (like Time-Sert or similar) can be used to repair the damaged threads. In severe cases, the cylinder head might need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the repair method and number of threads damaged.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold cracking or leaking is a common issue on older V10 engines. Symptoms include exhaust noise, reduced fuel economy, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked or leaking exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+ including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported issues with erratic shifting, harsh gear changes, or slipping, particularly at higher mileage. This can be due to valve body issues, worn solenoids, or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause is crucial. It could involve valve body replacement, solenoid replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3500+ depending on the severity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can manifest as shuddering, stalling, or complete loss of power transfer.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy-duty nature of the E-450 and its frequent use for carrying heavy loads, leaf springs can sag or crack over time, leading to poor ride quality, reduced load capacity, and potential safety concerns.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs is often recommended for vehicles that consistently carry heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle depending on the type of springs and labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint/Tie Rod End Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of ball joints and tie rod ends, resulting in loose steering, clunking noises, and potential alignment issues. This is often accelerated by heavy use and poor road conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and tie rod ends. An alignment is required after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per axle depending on the parts needed and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Alternator failure, leading to battery drain, electrical system malfunction, and potential vehicle stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion or damage to wiring harnesses, especially in areas exposed to the elements, can cause a variety of electrical problems, including sensor failures, lighting issues, and starting problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the affected wiring harness. This may involve replacing sections of the harness or repairing individual wires.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the complexity and location of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage/Frame**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, especially in areas with harsh winters or coastal environments, can significantly weaken the frame and undercarriage components over time.
    *   Solution: Rust prevention measures, such as undercoating, are helpful. In severe cases, frame repair or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (undercoating) - $5000+ (frame repair/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor might fail, resulting in no airflow from the vents.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a capable work vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine problems like spark plug thread stripping and exhaust manifold leaks can be moderately expensive to repair. Transmission issues, especially related to the 6-speed automatic, can be costly and should be addressed promptly. Suspension issues, such as leaf spring sagging and ball joint wear, are common due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical problems, including alternator failures and wiring harness corrosion, can also occur. While not all E-450s will experience these issues, being aware of them can help potential buyers make informed decisions and properly maintain their vehicles. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely depending on the usage, maintenance history, and geographical location of the vehicle.
