The 2015 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a popular choice for commercial applications like shuttle buses, ambulances, and delivery vans. It is known for its robust build and ample cargo space, making it a workhorse for various industries. However, it's not without its drawbacks. Many users find the ride quality harsh and the fuel economy poor, which is typical for a heavy-duty vehicle. It offers two engine options: the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine (305 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 engine (325 hp and 570 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with the 5R110W TorqShift 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10 Gasoline**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.8L V10 engine is known to eject spark plugs from the cylinder head, resulting in a loud popping noise, misfires, and a significant loss of power. This issue is caused by insufficient threads in the cylinder head for the spark plugs, particularly in earlier model years.
    *   Solution: The repair typically involves installing thread inserts (such as Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) to restore the cylinder head threads. Replacing the damaged spark plug is also necessary. In severe cases, the entire cylinder head may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the number of spark plugs that blew out and if any cylinder heads have to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler on the 6.0L Power Stroke is prone to failure, causing coolant to leak into the exhaust system. This can lead to white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler is the standard fix. Upgraded EGR coolers are available with improved durability. In some cases, the EGR valve may also need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fuel injectors on the 6.0L Power Stroke are known to fail, leading to rough idling, misfires, and a loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the failed fuel injector(s) is required. It is often recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter in the 5R110W transmission can fail, leading to shuddering during acceleration, difficulty shifting, and even complete loss of power.
    *   Solution: The torque converter needs to be replaced. It is often recommended to flush the transmission fluid and replace the filter as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting between gears, as well as transmission slippage, are common complaints. This can be caused by worn-out clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid levels.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. In more severe cases, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the transmission may need a complete rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $4000+ depending on the cause and if a rebuild is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the heavy loads that the E-450 often carries, the leaf springs can sag or even break over time, leading to a poor ride quality, reduced load capacity, and potential safety issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs is the common solution. Upgrading to heavier-duty leaf springs is recommended for vehicles that frequently carry heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator can fail prematurely, leading to a dead battery, dimming lights, and a no-start condition. This is often due to the high electrical demands of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator is necessary. Upgrading to a higher-output alternator is recommended for vehicles with many electrical accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The wiring harness can develop corrosion or damage, leading to various electrical problems such as intermittent lights, sensor malfunctions, and starting issues.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the damaged section of the wiring harness. In some cases, the entire harness may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the complexity of the damage
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Body Panels**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the body panels, especially in areas exposed to salt and moisture, such as around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and door seams.
    * Solution: Repair involves removing the rust, applying a rust inhibitor, and repainting the affected area. In severe cases, the body panel may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per panel
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor can fail, resulting in a lack of airflow from the vents. This can be caused by a faulty motor, resistor, or wiring.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the blower motor or resistor is the standard fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford E-450 Super Duty, while a reliable workhorse, has several potential issues. The most concerning are the engine-related problems with both the gasoline and diesel options, as well as transmission issues. The 6.8L V10 spark plug issue is very common. The 6.0L Power Stroke Diesel V8 also is very common. Suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior problems tend to be less severe but can still add to the overall cost of ownership. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchase. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission repairs.
