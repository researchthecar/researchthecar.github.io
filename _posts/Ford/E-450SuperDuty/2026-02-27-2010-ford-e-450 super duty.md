### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Ford E-450 Super Duty is generally a reliable platform for commercial use, particularly when equipped with the gasoline V8 engines. However, the diesel variants, especially the 6.0L Power Stroke, are known for more significant and costly potential issues such as EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head gasket failures, which are common across many Ford applications of this engine. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and solenoids, are also reported. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear due to the heavy-duty nature of the vehicle. Electrical issues like alternator failure and wiring harness corrosion are not uncommon. Owners should be aware of these potential problem areas, especially if considering a used diesel model, and factor in potential repair costs for a more informed decision.
