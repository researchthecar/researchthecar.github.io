**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can break during removal, particularly in higher mileage vehicles. This is often due to corrosion or improper initial installation torque.
    *   Solution: Use proper spark plug removal tools and techniques (penetrating oil, patience). In some cases, specialized extraction tools are required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the number of plugs that break and the complexity of the extraction).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracked exhaust manifolds or broken exhaust manifold bolts are common, leading to exhaust leaks. This is often noticed as a ticking sound, especially when the engine is cold.
    *   Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold or repair the exhaust manifold bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires can be caused by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. Rough idling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light are common symptoms.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder misfiring and replace the faulty component (ignition coil, spark plug, or fuel injector).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the component that needs replacement and the number of repairs needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 6R140 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. In some cases, a transmission flush and filter change can resolve the issue. If the problem persists, valve body issues may require professional diagnosis and repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for fluid and filter change; $800+ for valve body repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration felt during light acceleration, typically at lower speeds. This can be caused by a failing torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or groaning noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. Sagging rear suspension is also common, particularly with heavier upfits.
    *   Solution: Lubricate leaf springs or replace worn leaf springs. Airbag helper springs can be added to assist with load handling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for lubrication; $500 - $1500+ for leaf spring replacement; $300 - $800+ for airbag helper springs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks and Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, and reduced handling performance.
    *   Solution: Replace worn shocks and struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially if the vehicle sits unused for a few days.
    *   Solution: Inspect the battery for proper voltage and conduct a load test. Diagnose parasitic draw issues by checking for excessive current drain when the vehicle is off. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, or a failing alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for battery replacement; $100 - $500+ for parasitic draw diagnosis and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning sensors (e.g., ABS sensors, wheel speed sensors) can trigger warning lights and affect vehicle performance.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor failure using a scan tool and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage and Body Panels**
