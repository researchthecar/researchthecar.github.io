The 2012 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a popular choice for commercial use, often utilized as ambulances, shuttle buses, and delivery vans. The E-450 is liked for its ruggedness, high payload capacity, and spacious interior that can be customized for various applications. However, it's also criticized for its outdated design, relatively poor fuel economy, and sometimes cumbersome handling compared to more modern vans. The standard engine for the 2012 E-450 is a 5.4L Triton V8 producing 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. A 6.8L Triton V10 producing 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque was also available as an option. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 is known for its cylinder heads having insufficient threads for the spark plugs. This can lead to the spark plugs being ejected from the cylinder head, causing a misfire, loud popping noise, and potential damage to the surrounding components.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with a thread repair kit (like Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the repair method and whether the cylinder head needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Phaser Failure (Less Common on E-Series)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: While less common than in other Ford models, the 5.4L Triton V8 can experience camshaft phaser failure. Symptoms include a rattling noise at idle, especially when the engine is warm, rough idling, and potential loss of power. This is due to wear and tear on the phasers, disrupting the variable valve timing system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the camshaft phasers, timing chains, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.8L V10 is known for exhaust manifold leaks, typically caused by warped or cracked manifolds and broken exhaust manifold bolts. This results in a ticking or hissing sound, especially when the engine is cold, and can lead to reduced fuel economy and performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold and broken bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R75E 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4R75E transmission can experience hard shifting between gears or slipping, especially when hot. This can be caused by worn valve body components, low fluid level, or internal damage to the clutches and bands.
    *   Solution: Servicing the transmission (fluid and filter change), repairing or replacing the valve body, or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (service) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the torque converter can cause shuddering at low speeds, stalling, or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heavy-duty leaf springs on the E-450 are prone to sagging or even breaking, especially when the vehicle is consistently loaded near its maximum capacity. This can lead to a rough ride, reduced handling stability, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs might be considered if the vehicle is consistently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The ball joints can wear out prematurely, especially with heavy use and/or rough roads. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternators in the E-450 can be prone to failure, especially with the increased electrical load from aftermarket equipment like emergency lighting (in ambulances) or auxiliary climate control systems. Symptoms include a dead battery, dim headlights, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to age and exposure to the elements, the wiring harnesses in the E-450 can develop corrosion and shorts, leading to various electrical problems. This can manifest as malfunctioning lights, sensors, or other electrical components.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and repairing or replacing the affected wiring harness sections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity and location of the damage
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
