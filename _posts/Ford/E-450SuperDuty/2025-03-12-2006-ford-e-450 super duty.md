**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Ejection/Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to weak threads, especially during spark plug replacement. This can cause a misfire, loud popping noise, and engine stalling.
    *   Solution: Repairing the cylinder head threads with thread inserts (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold studs or warped manifolds can cause exhaust leaks, resulting in a ticking noise, reduced fuel economy, and potentially failed emissions tests.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold and studs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Power Stroke Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler can crack and leak coolant into the engine, potentially causing white smoke, overheating, and hydrolocking (if coolant enters the cylinders in large amounts).
    *   Solution: Replacing the EGR cooler with an upgraded or bulletproofed version.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2500+
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Injector failure can cause misfires, rough running, excessive smoke, and poor fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacing faulty injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once for even wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per injector (parts + labor)
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and bubbling in the coolant reservoir are common symptoms.  The 6.0L Power Stroke is known for being prone to head gasket failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the head gaskets, often with upgraded head studs to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Hard Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit hard or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause (worn clutches, valve body issues, solenoid failure) and repairing or rebuilding the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the severity of the issue and whether a repair or rebuild is necessary.
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, can indicate a torque converter issue.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front end, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    * Recalls: None Found
*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially under load, and potentially a harsh ride. Broken leaf springs are also a possibility.
    *   Solution: Replacing leaf springs or adding helper springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per side.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**

**Summary**

The 2006 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a capable workhorse, but like any vehicle of its age, it's prone to certain issues. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is particularly susceptible to costly repairs like EGR cooler and head gasket failures. Electrical issues and suspension wear are also common. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, paying close attention to the engine, transmission, and undercarriage, and obtain a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand for major engine or transmission repairs.
