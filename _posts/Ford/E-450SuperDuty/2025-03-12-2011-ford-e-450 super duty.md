**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs may break upon removal due to corrosion within the cylinder head. This can lead to difficult and costly repairs. Misfires, rough idling, and reduced power can occur.
    *   Solution: Use penetrating oil and specialized tools designed for removing stuck spark plugs. Sometimes, the cylinder head needs to be removed and repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs are prone to sagging or even breaking, particularly under heavy loads. This can affect ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with new or upgraded heavy-duty springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per spring replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The front suspension components, especially ball joints and tie rod ends, can wear out prematurely due to the vehicle's weight and usage. Symptoms include loose steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and tie rod ends. An alignment should also be performed after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**

**Summary**

The 2011 Ford E-450 Super Duty, while generally reliable, faces several common issues. The 5.4L engine has spark plug issues, while the 6.8L V10 is prone to exhaust manifold leaks. The 4-speed transmission can experience slipping and harsh shifting. Suspension problems, particularly with leaf springs and front-end components, are also prevalent. Electrical issues, like alternator failures and wiring harness damage, can occur. Rust is a significant concern for the exterior, and the HVAC blower motor can fail inside the cabin. The severity and cost of these issues vary widely, with some repairs being relatively inexpensive while others can be quite costly, particularly those involving the engine, transmission, or extensive rust repair. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
