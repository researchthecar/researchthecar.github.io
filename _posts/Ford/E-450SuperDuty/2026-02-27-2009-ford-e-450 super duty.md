### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a workhorse vehicle with a generally solid reputation for durability. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the Triton V8 and V10 engines, specifically spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and solenoid packs, are also noted. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints may require attention due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical system reliability is decent, though alternator failures can occur. Exterior rust is a concern in corrosive environments. Interior issues are less common, with blend door actuators being a notable, though not universal, problem. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these potential issues, the E-450 can remain a reliable asset for commercial use.
