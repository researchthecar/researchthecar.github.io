Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2010 Ford E-450 Super Duty, formatted for your website and based on publicly available information.

The 2010 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a popular choice for commercial use, often converted into ambulances, shuttle buses, and recreational vehicles. It was offered with two primary engine options: the 5.4L Triton V8 and the 6.8L Triton V10, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise its robust chassis and workhorse capabilities but sometimes criticize its fuel economy and aging design.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to weak threads, often accompanied by a loud popping sound and engine misfire. This is a known issue with earlier 5.4L Triton engines.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads using thread repair kits (e.g., Time-Sert) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the repair method and extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Exhaust Manifold Studs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold studs break, often due to corrosion, resulting in exhaust leaks, increased engine noise, and potential exhaust fumes entering the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken studs. This can be difficult and sometimes requires removing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ (depending on the labor involved)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold is prone to cracking or warping, leading to exhaust leaks. This results in a noticeable exhaust sound and potential for reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold and gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Thread repair or cylinder head replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **4R75E 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

    *   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
        *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission exhibits hard shifts, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly.
        *   Solution: Diagnosing and replacing faulty solenoids, valve body repair, or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,500+
        *   Recalls: None Found

    *   **Torque Converter Failure**
        *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter fails, leading to shuddering, stalling, or complete loss of drive.
        *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+
        *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive play in the front suspension, leading to clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear leaf springs sag, especially with heavy loads, leading to a lower ride height and reduced load-carrying capacity. In severe cases, they can crack or break.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,000+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming lights, battery not charging, and eventual complete electrical failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuse Box Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Corrosion in the fuse box can cause intermittent electrical problems, affecting various systems.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacing the fuse box.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford E-450 Super Duty, while a capable work vehicle, is prone to certain issues due to its age and design. Engine-related issues, such as spark plug thread failure and exhaust manifold leaks, are relatively common and can be costly to repair. Transmission problems, like harsh shifting and torque converter failure, also contribute to potential expenses. Suspension issues, particularly worn ball joints and leaf spring sagging, can affect handling and load capacity. Addressing these common problems proactively can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and extend its lifespan. The severity and cost of repairs vary widely depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage.
