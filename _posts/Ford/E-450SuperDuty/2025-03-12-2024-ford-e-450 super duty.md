The 2024 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a workhorse chassis cab primarily used for ambulances, shuttle buses, and other commercial applications. The only engine option is a 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 engine producing 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque. It is paired with a TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the E-450's robust build and suitability for heavy-duty tasks, but some dislike its dated design and fuel economy. Here's a breakdown of the issues and complaints specific to the 2024 Ford E-450 Super Duty, categorized for clarity:

**Engine**

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8**

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise from the engine, reduced power, misfires. In severe cases, the engine may stall or fail completely. This issue appears to be more prevalent in early production 7.3L engines.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty valve springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ depending on labor costs and extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil puddles under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level. Leaks are commonly reported from the oil pan gasket, valve cover gaskets, and front crankshaft seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals. Proper torque procedures must be followed during reassembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Can be accompanied by a clunking noise.
    *   Solution: First, check the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, a software update or valve body replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,500+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or vibrating sensation, especially at lower speeds or when the torque converter is locked up.
    *   Solution: A fluid flush and filter change using a specifically formulated fluid designed to mitigate torque converter shudder may help. In some cases, torque converter replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,500+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sagging on one or both sides, especially when loaded. Reduced ride height and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn leaf springs. Upgrading to heavier-duty springs may be recommended for vehicles that frequently carry heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side depending on the type of springs and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Shocks/Struts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or unstable ride, excessive body roll in corners, poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn shocks or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the brand of shocks/struts and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the vehicle, electrical components malfunctioning.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve testing various circuits and components to identify the faulty one. Common causes include faulty relays, alternators, or aftermarket accessories.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) illumination, inaccurate readings from sensors, drivability issues. Commonly reported sensor failures include oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and throttle position sensors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor depending on the type of sensor and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting (Early Stages)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Surface rust appearing on seams, undercarriage, and around wheel wells, particularly in areas where road salt is used.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and treating the affected areas to prevent further rust. Applying rust inhibitors or protective coatings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Discomfort**

    *   Solution: Adding aftermarket seat cushions or lumbar supports. Replacing the seats with aftermarket options.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $2,000+ depending on the chosen solution.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **HVAC Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent heating or cooling, weak airflow, strange noises from the HVAC system. Can be related to blower motor failure, blend door actuator issues, or refrigerant leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the specific issue. This may involve replacing the blower motor, blend door actuator, or repairing refrigerant leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+ depending on the complexity of the issue.
