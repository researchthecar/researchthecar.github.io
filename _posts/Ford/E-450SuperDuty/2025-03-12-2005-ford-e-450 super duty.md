The 2005 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a popular choice for commercial use, often configured as ambulances, shuttle buses, and delivery vehicles. It's known for its robust build and high payload capacity, making it a workhorse for various applications. Available engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (305 hp, 420 lb-ft torque), and the 7.3L Powerstroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp, 525 lb-ft torque) for the first half of the year and 6.0L Powerstroke Turbo Diesel V8 (325 hp, 570 lb-ft torque) for the second half of the year. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the E-450's reliability and work capabilities, but some common complaints revolve around the high cost of maintenance, fuel consumption, and some specific component failures due to the heavy-duty nature of its use.

**Engine**

    *   Solution: Replace the Cam Position Sensor
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.0L Powerstroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) cooler is prone to cracking and leaking coolant into the exhaust system, leading to white smoke, coolant loss, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an updated or bulletproofed version. Consider deleting the EGR system entirely (check local regulations).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The oil cooler can become clogged with debris or corrode, leading to a restriction in oil flow and overheating of the engine. It can also leak oil into the coolant system.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler with an updated or relocated unit. Flush the cooling system thoroughly if oil contamination is present.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sticking or failing fuel injectors can cause rough running, misfires, and decreased fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Perform a fuel injector test to identify faulty injectors. Replace the affected injectors. Consider replacing all injectors at once for even performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **4R100 4-Speed Automatic**

    *   **Torque Converter Failure**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Transmission slipping and overall poor performance.
        *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission fluid. Inspect the transmission for any internal damage.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
        *   Recalls: None Found

    *   **Valve Body Issues**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, and slipping between gears.
        *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Ensure proper fluid levels and condition.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
        *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs, especially in the rear, are prone to sagging over time due to the heavy loads the E-450 is designed to carry. This can result in reduced ride height, poor handling, and increased wear on other suspension components. In severe cases, the leaf springs can break.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with heavy-duty aftermarket springs. Consider adding helper springs or air bags for additional support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive wear in the ball joints leads to clunking noises in the front suspension, wandering steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints. Inspect other steering and suspension components for wear and replace as necessary.

**Summary**

The 2005 Ford E-450 Super Duty, while a robust and capable vehicle, is prone to some common issues due to its heavy-duty application and age. Engine-related issues, particularly with the spark plugs on the Triton engines and the EGR/oil cooler problems on the 6.0L Powerstroke, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially with the torque converter and valve body, are also prevalent. Suspension problems, like leaf spring sagging and ball joint wear, are common due to the vehicle's heavy load-carrying capacity. Electrical issues, such as alternator and fuel pump relay failures, can cause inconvenience and require prompt attention. Rust and dashboard cracking are also frequently reported. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing and maintenance plans.
