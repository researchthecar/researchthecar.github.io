**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can become loose and eject from the cylinder head, causing a loud popping noise, misfires, and loss of power. This is often due to weakened threads in the aluminum cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with a thread repair kit (like Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the repair method and if the cylinder head needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold bolts can corrode and break, causing exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, and a decrease in fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts and possibly the exhaust manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear, or slipping during acceleration.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, a faulty valve body, or worn clutches. Start with a fluid flush and filter change. If that doesn't resolve it, further diagnostics are needed, possibly leading to valve body repair or replacement, or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter) to $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, especially under light acceleration, or complete loss of drive.

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially when loaded, or visible cracks in the leaf springs. This can lead to a rough ride and reduced load-carrying capacity.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per side (depending on spring type and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
