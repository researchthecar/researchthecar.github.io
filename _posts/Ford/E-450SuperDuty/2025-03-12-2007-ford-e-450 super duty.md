Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues reported for the 2007 Ford E-450 Super Duty, organized by category and engine/transmission options, adhering to your specified format. The 2007 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a popular choice for commercial applications like ambulances, shuttle buses, and recreational vehicles due to its robust chassis and payload capacity. The E-450 Super Duty was available with two engine options: the 5.4L Triton V8 and the 6.8L Triton V10. The 5.4L V8 produced approximately 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Common owner praises included the vehicle's reliability and ample cargo space. Downsides mentioned often involve the lower fuel efficiency and some ride quality concerns especially when not loaded.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues (Specifically with 2-piece Spark Plugs)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs are prone to breaking inside the cylinder head during removal. This can cause significant difficulty in spark plug replacement. Misfires can occur due to faulty spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Use a specialized tool designed to remove broken spark plugs. Careful extraction is necessary to avoid damage to the cylinder head. Replacement with one-piece spark plugs can prevent future occurrences.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of plugs broken and labor required for extraction, and if cylinder head repair is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Roller Follower Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The roller followers that contact the camshaft are prone to failure that leads to excessive engine noise, and potentially valve train damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing roller followers, potentially the camshaft if damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold studs are prone to breaking, leading to exhaust leaks. This can cause a noticeable hissing sound, reduced fuel economy, and potentially exhaust fumes entering the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing broken exhaust manifold studs and gaskets. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may need to be replaced if it's warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Issues (Specifically with 2-piece Spark Plugs)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, the 6.8L also suffers from the problematic two-piece spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Same as 5.4L
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Same as 5.4L
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R75E Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Complete transmission failure is possible in severe cases.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. A transmission flush and filter change is recommended at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifting, or failure to shift into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially when loaded. Reduced ride quality and handling. In extreme cases, broken leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty leaf springs if the vehicle is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (per axle)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Front-end noises (clunking or squeaking), loose steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Battery not charging, dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, eventually leading to the vehicle stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
