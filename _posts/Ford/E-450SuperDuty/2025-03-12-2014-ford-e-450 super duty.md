Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2014 Ford E-450 Super Duty, formatted for your website's needs.

The 2014 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a robust workhorse primarily used for commercial applications like shuttle buses, ambulances, and delivery vehicles. It generally offers reliable performance and a strong, durable chassis. Owners often praise its towing capacity, payload capabilities, and overall dependability. However, the E-450 is not without its drawbacks, with some owners reporting issues with fuel economy, ride quality (especially when unloaded), and certain mechanical components. The 2014 E-450 Super Duty was available with the 6.8L Triton V10 engine, producing approximately 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque, or the 5.4L Triton V8 engine which produced approximately 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engine options were paired with the Ford 4R75E 4-speed automatic transmission or the Ford 5R110W 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to stripped threads, leading to a loss of power, misfires, and a loud popping noise. This is a common issue with earlier versions of this engine, and while the 2014 is less susceptible, it can still occur.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads in the cylinder head using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or similar) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold bolts can break or corrode, leading to exhaust leaks. This results in a noticeable hissing or ticking sound, reduced fuel economy, and potentially a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts and possibly the exhaust manifold gasket. In severe cases, the manifold itself may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the severity and if the manifold needs replacing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise, especially on startup. Rough idling, loss of power, and potential stalling. This is due to wear or failure of the cam phasers, part of the variable valve timing (VVT) system.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chains, chain guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the V10, spark plugs can break upon removal, leaving part of the plug in the cylinder head. Difficult starting, misfires, and rough running.
    *   Solution: Use a special tool to extract the broken spark plug electrode. Use anti-seize compound on new spark plugs to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$1000 (depending on ease of removal or professional help is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 4R75E 4-speed automatic transmission**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Ford 5R110W 5-speed automatic transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Transmission slipping, difficulty shifting, and potential stalling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter and flushing the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, and transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Replacing or rebuilding the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sagging, especially when loaded. Reduced ride height, poor handling, and potential cracking or breaking of the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the extent of the damage and quality of replacement springs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on whether upper and lower ball joints need replacing)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard (e.g., battery light), and eventual loss of power. Difficulty starting the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuse Box Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as lights not working, accessories failing, or difficulty starting. Corrosion within the fuse box can cause shorts and malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the fuse box and replacing corroded fuses and connectors. In severe cases, the fuse box itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the severity of the corrosion and need for replacement parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the undercarriage, body panels, and around wheel wells. Common in areas with harsh winters or high humidity.
    *   Solution: Sanding and treating the rust, followed by painting. In severe cases, body panel replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak or no cold air from the air conditioning system. This can be due to a refrigerant leak, a faulty compressor, or a clogged evaporator.
    *   Solution: Repairing the leak, replacing the compressor, or cleaning/replacing the evaporator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1200+ (depending on the cause of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2014 Ford E-450 Super Duty, while generally reliable, has some potential issues to be aware of. The 6.8L V10 and 5.4L V8 engines can suffer from spark plug and cam phaser issues which can be costly. Both transmission options have the potential for torque converter and valve body issues. Suspension problems, particularly leaf spring sagging and ball joint wear, are also common. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure and fuse box corrosion, can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, with some repairs being relatively inexpensive and others requiring more extensive and costly work. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended to identify any potential problems and budget accordingly.
