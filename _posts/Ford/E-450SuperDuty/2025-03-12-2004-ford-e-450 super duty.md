The 2004 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a full-size van and cutaway chassis primarily used for commercial purposes such as ambulances, shuttle buses, and RVs. The engine options for the 2004 E-450 included the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (305 hp, 420 lb-ft of torque), and the 7.3L Powerstroke Diesel V8 (275 hp, 525 lb-ft of torque). A primary selling point is its robust build and reliability for heavy-duty work. Common complaints include the cost of maintenance and fuel consumption.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plugs Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 5.4L Triton V8 is known for having spark plugs that seize in the cylinder heads, often breaking during removal. This is due to a unique two-piece spark plug design used in some model years. Symptoms include difficulty removing spark plugs during maintenance or engine misfires due to spark plug failure.
    *   Solution: Special spark plug extraction tools are available to remove broken plugs. Anti-seize compound should be used on new spark plugs during installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+, depending on the number of plugs that break and whether a professional mechanic is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifolds on the 5.4L Triton engine are prone to warping and cracking over time, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking or hissing noise, especially on cold starts, and reduced fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the warped or cracked exhaust manifold and exhaust manifold bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plugs Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 6.8L Triton V10 also shares the spark plug issue with the 5.4L Triton, where plugs seize and break during removal.
    *   Solution: Same as the 5.4L Triton: Special extraction tools and anti-seize compound.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+, due to the higher number of spark plugs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifolds on the 6.8L Triton engine are prone to warping and cracking over time, leading to exhaust leaks. Symptoms include a ticking or hissing noise, especially on cold starts, and reduced fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the warped or cracked exhaust manifold and exhaust manifold bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $900+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Powerstroke Diesel V8**

*   **Cam Position Sensor (CPS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Cam Position Sensor is known to fail, causing stalling, rough running, or a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the Cam Position Sensor (CPS).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Relay Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The glow plug relay can fail, causing hard starting or a no-start condition, especially in cold weather. This is due to the glow plugs not heating up properly to ignite the fuel.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the glow plug relay.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*No subcategories needed as all engines use the 4R100 Automatic Transmission*

*   **Hard or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4R100 transmission can develop hard or erratic shifting patterns, sometimes accompanied by slipping between gears. This can be due to worn valve body components, failing solenoids, or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions can range from a transmission fluid flush and filter change to valve body repair or replacement, or a full transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush) - $3500+ (rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering or vibrations, especially during acceleration or when climbing hills.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+

**Summary:**

The 2004 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a dependable vehicle but suffers from some common issues related to engine design, transmission wear, and general aging. Engine issues, particularly with the 5.4L and 6.8L Triton engines, can be costly due to the spark plug design. Transmission problems can range from minor to severe, requiring expensive rebuilds. Suspension components wear out over time, affecting ride quality and handling. Electrical issues, rust, and interior problems further contribute to the overall cost of ownership. While some issues are relatively inexpensive to fix, others can be significant financial burdens, particularly if left unaddressed. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas before purchasing.
