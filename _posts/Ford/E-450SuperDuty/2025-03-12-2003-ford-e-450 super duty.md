**Summary**

The 2003 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a generally reliable vehicle, but owners should be aware of common issues. Engine issues, particularly with the spark plugs on the Triton engines and the EGR/oil cooler on the 6.0L diesel, can be expensive to fix. Transmission problems, especially with the 4R100 and E4OD can also be costly. Suspension components wear out over time, and rust can be a concern in certain climates. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to significant repair bills. Performing regular maintenance and addressing problems early can help extend the life of this workhorse vehicle.
