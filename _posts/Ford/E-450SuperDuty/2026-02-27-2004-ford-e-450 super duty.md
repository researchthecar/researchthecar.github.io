### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a workhorse vehicle with a generally solid reputation for durability. However, specific engine options, particularly the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel, are known for requiring significant attention to potential failure points like the EGR and oil coolers, as well as head gaskets. The gasoline Triton V8s can experience spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks. Transmission issues, while not universal, can arise with torque converters and solenoids. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and wiring corrosion are also noted. Rust can be a concern depending on climate. Overall, with diligent maintenance and proactive addressing of known issues, the E-450 can remain a reliable asset for commercial use.
