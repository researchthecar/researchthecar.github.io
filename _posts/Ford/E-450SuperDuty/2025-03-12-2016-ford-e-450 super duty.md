The 2016 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a popular choice for shuttle buses, ambulances, and recreational vehicles due to its robust build and towing capacity. Engine options for the 2016 E-450 include the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine, producing 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. The transmission is a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the E-450's reliability and workhorse capabilities, but some common complaints revolve around fuel economy and certain mechanical issues.

**Engine**

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can loosen and eject from the cylinder head, leading to a loss of power, loud popping noises, and potential damage to the spark plug wires or surrounding components. This issue is common in earlier Triton engines, but can still occur in the 2016 model.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads in the cylinder head using a thread insert kit (such as a Time-Sert or Helicoil) is the preferred method. Replacing the cylinder head is also an option but more expensive. Use anti-seize compound on the spark plug threads during installation.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the repair method and the number of spark plugs affected.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Stud Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust manifold studs can break due to corrosion and heat cycling. This can cause exhaust leaks, a ticking noise (especially when cold), and decreased fuel efficiency.
    *   Solution: Broken studs need to be extracted and replaced. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may need to be replaced if it is warped or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the number of studs and condition of the manifold.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (TorqShift 5R110W)**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit harsh or delayed shifts, particularly between certain gears. This can be due to worn valve body components or issues with the transmission control module (TCM).
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may improve shifting. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced. In some cases, the TCM may need to be reprogrammed or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $2000+ (valve body replacement/TCM replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The leaf springs, particularly in the rear suspension, can sag or even crack under heavy loads, leading to a loss of ride height, poor handling, and increased body roll.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs is the most common solution. Upgrading to heavy-duty leaf springs can prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle, depending on the brand of leaf springs and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ball joints can wear out over time, especially with heavy use. Symptoms include clunking noises from the front suspension, steering looseness, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints. It is usually recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per pair, depending on the type of ball joints and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The alternator may fail due to high electrical demands and heat. Symptoms include a dead battery, dimming headlights, and warning lights on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator. Upgrading to a heavy-duty alternator may be beneficial for vehicles with high electrical loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+ depending on the type of alternator and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Brake Light Switch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The brake light switch can fail, causing the brake lights to remain on or not illuminate at all. This can also affect cruise control functionality.
    *   Solution: Replacing the brake light switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on labor costs.
    *   Recalls: 16V025000

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust, especially in areas with road salt, can develop on the frame, suspension components, and other undercarriage parts.
    *   Solution: Cleaning and coating the affected areas with a rust inhibitor. In severe cases, welding repair or component replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor can fail, resulting in a lack of airflow from the vents. This can be due to a faulty motor, resistor, or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor, resistor, or repairing the wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ depending on the component that needs to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford E-450 Super Duty is generally a reliable work vehicle, but owners should be aware of potential issues such as spark plug blowouts, exhaust manifold stud failures, leaf spring sagging, alternator failures, and undercarriage rust. The severity and cost of these issues can vary, but addressing them promptly can help prevent further damage and ensure the vehicle's longevity. The brake light switch recall should be checked and resolved if necessary.
