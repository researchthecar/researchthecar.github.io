The 2023 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a cutaway chassis primarily used for applications like shuttle buses, ambulances, and recreational vehicles. It is valued for its robust build, reliability, and ample space for upfitting. However, some owners have reported concerns about ride quality and fuel economy. The E-450 comes standard with a 7.3L V8 gasoline engine producing 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, paired with a TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. There are no other engine options.

**Engine**

**7.3L V8 Gasoline**

*   **Engine Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil drips from the engine area, noticeable oil consumption, and potential for oil pressure warning lights. The leaks are often traced to the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or seal. For the rear main seal, this often requires removing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 for valve cover gaskets; $300 - $600 for oil pan gasket; $800 - $1500+ for rear main seal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine consumes an abnormal amount of oil between oil changes, often more than 1 quart per 1,000 miles. Blue smoke from the exhaust may also be present.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of oil consumption. This could include piston ring wear, valve stem seal issues, or PCV valve failure. Repair may involve replacing piston rings, valve stem seals, or the PCV valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for PCV valve; $3,000 - $6,000+ for piston ring replacement or engine rebuild.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts between gears, a noticeable "clunk" sound during shifts, or hesitation when shifting. This issue is more common with the 6R140 version of the TorqShift transmission that is paired with the 7.3L V8.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis of the transmission, which may involve checking fluid levels and condition, inspecting solenoids, and potentially a valve body inspection. Solutions range from fluid changes to valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for fluid change; $500 - $1500 for valve body replacement; $3,000 - $6,000+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noises coming from the leaf springs, especially noticeable when driving over bumps or rough roads.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of the leaf spring bushings and contact points. If lubrication doesn't solve the issue, bushing replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 for lubrication; $200 - $500+ for bushing replacement per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains unexpectedly, leading to difficulty starting or a completely dead battery. This is often related to aftermarket upfits or accessories not installed correctly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the parasitic drain by testing individual circuits and components. Disconnecting aftermarket accessories to isolate the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for diagnosis; cost varies widely depending on the cause and repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated on the dashboard. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) indicating issues with various sensors, such as oxygen sensors, mass airflow (MAF) sensors, or crankshaft position sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis with a scan tool to identify the faulty sensor. Replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per sensor replacement, depending on the sensor type and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion on Undercarriage Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the frame, suspension components, and other metal parts underneath the vehicle. This is more prevalent in areas with harsh winters or coastal climates.
    *   Solution: Rust removal and application of rust inhibitors and protective coatings. In severe cases, replacement of corroded parts may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ for rust removal and coating; cost varies widely depending on the severity and extent of the corrosion.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The HVAC blower motor stops working, resulting in no airflow from the vents. This may be intermittent at first, then become a complete failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the blower motor. It is also recommended to check the blower motor resistor and wiring harness.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Radio/Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The radio or infotainment system freezes, glitches, or malfunctions. Bluetooth connectivity problems.
    *   Solution: Software update, system reset, or replacement of the head unit.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100 for software update; $200 - $1000+ for head unit replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2023 Ford E-450 Super Duty, while generally considered a reliable workhorse, does have some common issues reported by owners. Engine oil leaks and excessive oil consumption in the 7.3L V8 are potential concerns, and the 6-speed TorqShift transmission can exhibit harsh shifting. Electrical and suspension issues, such as battery drain and leaf spring squeaking, also occur. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can prevent further damage and ensure the vehicle's longevity. While the E-450 is typically upfitted with a custom body for commercial purposes, the common issues are related to the original Ford Chassis.
