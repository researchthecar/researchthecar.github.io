### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ford E-450 Super Duty demonstrates a generally solid reliability profile, particularly given its commercial application and intended use. The powertrain options, while robust, can experience specific issues such as spark plug blowout on the V10 or camshaft sensor problems on the V8, which are not uncommon for these Ford engines. Transmission issues, primarily related to the torque converter and fluid leaks, are also noted. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can be subject to wear and breakage under heavy loads. Electrical systems, particularly the alternator, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor and instrument cluster, are areas where failures can occur. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of these potential issues can significantly contribute to the longevity and dependable operation of the E-450.
