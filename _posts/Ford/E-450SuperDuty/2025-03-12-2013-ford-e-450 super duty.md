The 2013 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a popular choice for commercial applications like shuttle buses, ambulances, and recreational vehicles due to its robust construction and ample cargo capacity. Owners often appreciate its payload capacity and dependability for heavy-duty use. However, the vehicle has been criticized for its fuel economy and basic interior features. Under the hood, the 2013 E-450 Super Duty primarily featured the 6.8L Triton V10 gasoline engine, producing around 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. A 5.4L Triton V8 was also available as a more fuel-efficient (relatively speaking) option, generating approximately 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.
