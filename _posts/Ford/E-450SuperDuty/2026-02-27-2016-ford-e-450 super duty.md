### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford E-450 Super Duty demonstrates solid mechanical reliability, particularly in its powertrain and chassis components, which are built for demanding commercial applications. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the gasoline V10 and V8 engines, specifically concerning intake manifold gaskets and spark plug retention on the V10, and camshaft sensors/ignition coils on the V8. The automatic transmission is generally robust, though torque converter and solenoid issues can arise. Suspension components, especially leaf springs and ball joints, can experience wear due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical system concerns, such as alternator failure, are also noted. Overall, the E-450 is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be aware of these potential mechanical and electrical weak points, especially when purchasing used or operating under heavy loads.
