Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2009 Ford E-450 Super Duty, organized by category and engine/transmission option, formatted for your website.

The 2009 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a popular choice for commercial applications like ambulances, shuttle buses, and recreational vehicles. It was offered with two primary engine options: the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 horsepower, 350 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.8L Triton V10 (305 horsepower, 420 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the E-450's robust build and high payload capacity. However, some common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride quality, and the cost of repairs, especially as these vehicles age.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to weak threads in the aluminum head. This is often accompanied by a loud popping noise, misfire, and reduced engine power.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head. Installation of thread repair inserts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking noise that is more prevalent when the engine is cold. It often goes away once the engine warms up.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chains, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable exhaust leak sound, often described as a ticking or hissing noise, especially when the engine is cold. Can lead to decreased fuel economy and potentially affect emissions.
    *   Solution: Replace the exhaust manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to weak threads in the aluminum head. This is often accompanied by a loud popping noise, misfire, and reduced engine power.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head. Installation of thread repair inserts.
