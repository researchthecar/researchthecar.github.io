### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford E-450 Super Duty demonstrates a mixed reliability profile, with its heavy-duty nature often leading to more significant potential issues compared to lighter vehicles. The gasoline engines (5.4L and 6.8L V10) are prone to spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, is notorious for several critical failure points including EGR coolers, oil coolers, and head gaskets, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and internal components, are also noted. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear out under heavy use. Electrical system components like the alternator are standard wear items. Overall, while capable, the E-450 requires diligent maintenance, especially concerning the diesel engine's complex systems, to ensure continued reliability.
