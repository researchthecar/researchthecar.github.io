### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford E-450 Super Duty demonstrates a mixed reliability profile. The gasoline V8 and V10 engines are generally robust but prone to spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, is notorious for significant issues like EGR cooler failure, oil cooler failure, and head gasket problems, which can be very costly to repair. Transmissions, particularly the 5R110W, can experience torque converter and overheating issues. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear, as expected for a heavy-duty vehicle. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure and wiring problems, are also reported. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Interior issues are less critical, with blower motor and instrument cluster failures being the most common. Overall, the E-450 is a capable workhorse, but potential buyers, especially of the diesel variant, should be aware of and budget for common, potentially expensive, repairs.
