### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a capable commercial vehicle with a generally solid reputation for durability, especially when equipped with the larger V10 or diesel engines. However, specific issues are noted, particularly with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel, which is known for potential EGR cooler and head gasket problems. The gasoline V8 engines can suffer from spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks. Transmission issues, while not universal, can include torque converter and solenoid problems. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are also possible. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing known weak points, especially on the diesel models, are key to maintaining the reliability of the 2007 E-450.
