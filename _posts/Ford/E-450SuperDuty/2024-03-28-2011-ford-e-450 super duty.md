### **Engine**

**5.4L V8**
* **Intake manifold failure:** The plastic intake manifold can crack, causing coolant leaks, engine overheating, and poor performance. The solution is to replace the intake manifold. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
* **Cam phaser failure:** The cam phasers, which control the timing of the camshaft, can fail, leading to engine rattling, reduced power, and decreased fuel economy. The solution is to replace the cam phasers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,000+

**6.8L V10**
* **Spark plug blow-out:** The spark plugs can blow out of the cylinder head, causing severe engine damage. The solution is to replace the damaged cylinder head and spark plugs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $3,000+

**6.0L Power Stroke**
* **Injector failure:** The fuel injectors can fail, causing rough idling, loss of power, and increased emissions. The solution is to replace the faulty injectors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+ per injector
* **EGR valve failure:** The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve can fail, leading to increased emissions and reduced engine performance. The solution is to replace the EGR valve. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail, causing reduced power, increased exhaust smoke, and decreased fuel economy. The solution is to replace the turbocharger. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+

### **Transmission**

**6-speed Automatic**
* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter can develop a shudder during acceleration, causing uncomfortable vibrations. The solution is to replace the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
* **Transmission slippage:** The transmission can slip or fail to engage gears, causing loss of power and difficulty driving. The solution is to repair or replace the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $3,000+

**5-speed Automatic**
* **No issues found**

### **Suspension**

* **Rear leaf spring failure:** The rear leaf springs can fail, causing the rear end of the vehicle to sag and affect handling. The solution is to replace the leaf springs. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
* **Shock absorber failure:** The shock absorbers can fail, leading to a rough ride and reduced stability. The solution is to replace the shock absorbers. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per shock

### **Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** The battery can drain prematurely, causing difficulty starting the vehicle. The solution is to test and replace the faulty electrical components that are draining the battery. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
