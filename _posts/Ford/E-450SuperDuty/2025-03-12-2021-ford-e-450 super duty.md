Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Ford E-450 Super Duty, formatted for your website. The 2021 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a robust chassis cab designed primarily for commercial applications like ambulances, shuttle buses, and RVs. It's known for its strong payload capacity and durable construction, making it a popular choice for upfitting. The 2021 model year primarily features the 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 engine. This engine produces 350 hp and 468 lb-ft of torque and is paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate the E-450's reliability and simplicity, finding it easy to maintain and repair. Common complaints revolve around fuel economy, ride comfort (especially when unloaded), and the somewhat dated interior design compared to newer vans.

**Engine**

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, particularly during the initial break-in period. This can manifest as needing to add oil more frequently than usual between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Monitor oil levels closely. Some cases resolve themselves as the engine breaks in. If consumption remains high, a dealer inspection is recommended. In severe cases, piston ring issues may require engine repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Dependent on the root cause. Diagnostic checks are usually around $100 - $200. If the repair is engine related, it may cost $2,000 - $10,000.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Ford 6R140 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear or when downshifting. Slipping can also occur, where the engine revs without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: Start with checking the transmission fluid level and condition. A fluid flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal damage may require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush and filter change may cost around $200-$400. A valve body replacement could cost $800-$1500. A full rebuild or replacement can range from $3,000 - $7,000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rough Ride Quality**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The E-450, especially when unloaded, is known for a firm and sometimes harsh ride. This is due to the heavy-duty suspension designed for supporting substantial weight.
    *   Solution: This is an inherent characteristic of the vehicle. Adding weight (payload) improves the ride. Aftermarket suspension upgrades, such as air springs or softer leaf springs, can also improve ride comfort.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: The cost varies widely depending on the upgrade. Air spring kits can range from $500 - $2000+ plus installation.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues (Potential)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, particularly if the vehicle sits unused for extended periods. This can lead to difficulty starting or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Check for parasitic drains by testing individual circuits with an ammeter. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, improperly installed wiring, or a failing alternator diode. The battery itself should also be tested.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: A simple battery replacement is around $150 - $300. Diagnosing and repairing parasitic drains can range from $100 - $500+ depending on the complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Undercarriage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature rust on the undercarriage in areas with high salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Apply rust inhibitor or rust prevention coatings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor stops working.
    *   Solution: Replace the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford E-450 Super Duty is a durable and capable chassis cab, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Some owners have reported oil consumption issues in the 7.3L engine and harsh shifting in the transmission. Electrical problems such as battery drains and interior problems such as blower motor failures are relatively minor and can be fixed without spending too much. Rust on the undercarriage is also a common issue, especially in areas with lots of road salt. The ride quality can also be a significant concern for owners who frequently drive the E-450 unloaded. Addressing these proactively can help ensure long-term reliability.
