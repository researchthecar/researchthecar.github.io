### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford E-450 Super Duty demonstrates a generally reliable performance profile for its class. The most frequently cited issues revolve around the older Triton V8 and V10 engines, specifically spark plug ejection and camshaft sensor failures, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with the 4R75E, can include torque converter problems and fluid leaks. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear due to the vehicle's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are also noted. While these potential problems exist, they are often manageable with proper maintenance and timely repairs. The newer 6.2L V8 and 6R140 transmission appear to be more robust. Overall, the E-450 is a capable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific mechanical and electrical considerations.
