**Introduction:**

The 1992 Ford Cougar is a two-door, front-wheel-drive coupe that was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The standard engine was a 3.8-liter V6 with 140 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque, while a 2.5-liter V6 with 155 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque and a 4.6-liter V8 with 200 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque were optional.
