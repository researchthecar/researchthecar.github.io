    * **Cracked Pistons:** Pistons can crack under high pressure, causing catastrophic engine failure.
    * **Fuel Injector Failure:** Fuel injectors can become clogged or faulty, resulting in poor engine performance and increased emissions.

**Transmission**

* **Eaton Fuller 13-Speed Manual**
    * **Shifting Problems:** Shifting difficulty or grinding may be encountered while operating the manual transmission.
    * **Clutch Failure:** The clutch can wear prematurely, slipping or even failing completely.
