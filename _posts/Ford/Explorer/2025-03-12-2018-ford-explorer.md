The 2018 Ford Explorer is a popular mid-size SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available third-row seating. Engine options include a 2.3L EcoBoost I4 (280 hp, 310 lb-ft torque), a 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 (290 hp, 255 lb-ft torque), and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (365 hp, 350 lb-ft torque) exclusive to the Sport and Platinum trims. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Explorer's versatility and cargo space. However, some common complaints revolve around transmission issues, electrical problems, and concerns about ride quality with larger wheels.

**Engine**

**2.3L EcoBoost I4**
*   **Coolant Intrusion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks into the cylinders, causing white smoke from the exhaust, rough running, and potential engine damage. This is due to a crack in the cylinder head near the #3 cylinder.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head is needed, and potentially the entire engine if damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Ti-VCT V6**
*   **Timing Chain Wear/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise at startup, especially when cold. This can progress to rough running, misfires, and eventually complete engine failure if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially camshaft phasers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**
*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke (blue or white) from the exhaust, and unusual noises from the engine compartment.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected turbocharger(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000 (per turbocharger)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts between gears, especially during acceleration or deceleration. Transmission may slip or hesitate when shifting.
    *   Solution: Could be caused by low transmission fluid, a faulty valve body, or internal damage to the transmission. Solutions range from a fluid flush and filter change to a valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shaking or shuddering sensation, particularly at low speeds or when the torque converter is locking up.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush with updated friction modifier additives might resolve the issue. In more severe cases, torque converter replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or clunking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps or uneven surfaces. Often related to worn or dry bushings.
    *   Solution: Inspection and replacement of worn bushings (stabilizer bar, control arm) and potentially the rear shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Failed Power Liftgate Motor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power liftgate fails to open or close properly. Motor makes noise or doesn't respond at all.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the power liftgate motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Faulty Door Ajar Sensor**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door ajar light stays illuminated on the dashboard, even when all doors are securely closed. Can lead to battery drain and interior lights staying on.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty door ajar sensor, often located within the door latch assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Ford SYNC infotainment system freezes, crashes, or becomes unresponsive. May require frequent resets.
    *   Solution: Software updates may resolve some issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the SYNC module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Water Leaks (Sunroof/Windshield)**

**Summary**

The 2018 Ford Explorer, while generally a reliable vehicle, experiences a range of potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with coolant intrusion in the 2.3L EcoBoost and timing chain issues in the 3.5L Ti-VCT V6, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting and shuddering, are also relatively common across all engine configurations. Other areas of concern include electrical problems with the liftgate, door sensors, and infotainment system, as well as potential water leaks and interior component failures. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major repairs, with potential costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and thoroughly inspect any used 2018 Explorer before purchasing.
