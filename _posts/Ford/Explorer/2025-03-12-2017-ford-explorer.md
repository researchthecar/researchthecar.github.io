The 2017 Ford Explorer is a popular mid-size SUV known for its spaciousness and versatility, offering seating for up to seven passengers. It was available with three engine options: a 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 producing 290 hp and 255 lb-ft of torque, a 2.3L EcoBoost I4 producing 280 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 producing 365 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque (found in the Sport and Platinum trims). All engine options were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Explorer for its comfortable ride and ample cargo space, but some common complaints revolve around the infotainment system's responsiveness, transmission issues, and certain electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**2.3L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion into Cylinders**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant seeping into cylinders, white smoke from the exhaust, engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine failure. This is often due to cracking or warping of the cylinder head in the 2.3L EcoBoost Engine.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head. In severe cases, complete engine replacement may be necessary if the coolant intrusion caused irreversible damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L Ti-VCT V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Internal water pump failure leading to coolant leaking into the engine oil. Can result in engine overheating, bearing damage and catastrophic engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump and associated components. Oil and filter change to remove any contaminated oil. Engine flush may also be needed to remove any other contaminants.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, whistling sound from the engine, check engine light illumination. Diagnosed by inspecting the turbocharger for damage, checking boost pressure, and looking for oil leaks.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement. It's often recommended to replace both turbochargers at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $5,000+

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford Explorer can be a reliable SUV, but it's essential to be aware of the potential issues. Engine problems, particularly coolant intrusion in the 2.3L EcoBoost and water pump failure in the 3.5L Ti-VCT, can be severe and costly to repair. Transmission issues, though common across various models, can also lead to expensive repairs. Electrical glitches with the infotainment system and liftgate can be frustrating. Overall, a thorough inspection, a detailed vehicle history report, and a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic are highly recommended to avoid potential headaches down the road. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs spanning from a few hundred dollars to several thousands.
