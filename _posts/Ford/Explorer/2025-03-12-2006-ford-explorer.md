Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2006 Ford Explorer, categorized by major component, engine, and transmission options, along with specific details and estimated repair costs.

The 2006 Ford Explorer is a popular mid-size SUV known for its truck-based construction, offering a more rugged feel than some of its competitors. Engine options included a 4.0L V6 and a 4.6L V8, both paired with automatic transmissions. The 4.0L V6 produced around 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, offering adequate performance for daily driving. The 4.6L V8 provided a more robust 292 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, improving towing capacity and overall acceleration. Owners often praised the Explorer's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available third-row seating, making it suitable for families. However, common complaints included relatively poor fuel economy, especially with the V8 engine, and concerns about reliability, particularly regarding certain drivetrain components.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold. The engine may run rough or misfire. Worn or broken timing chain tensioners can cause timing chain slack, leading to potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioners, timing chains, and possibly guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough idling, poor fuel economy, check engine light with codes related to camshaft position sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty camshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a common issue with the 4.6L V8 modular engine. Spark plugs may eject from the cylinder head due to stripped threads. A ticking noise is often heard as exhaust gases escape, and the engine will run poorly.
    *   Solution: Repair the threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ (depending on the repair method and number of affected cylinders)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noise, especially when the engine is cold, diminishing as the engine warms up. Burning smell and potentially reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replace the cracked or warped exhaust manifold and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5R55S 5-Speed Automatic (Typically Paired with 4.0L V6)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, especially when cold. Can cause transmission failure if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. Sometimes a valve body cleaning and recalibration can solve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6R60/6R75 6-Speed Automatic (Typically Paired with 4.6L V8)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at low speeds. May also cause a complete loss of drive or unusual noises from the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's often recommended to flush the transmission fluid and inspect for any other potential issues at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sitting lower than the front, especially when loaded. Reduced ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear coil springs or add helper springs or air bags.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps. Loose steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. It's often recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning, flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Replace or repair the instrument cluster. Some shops specialize in instrument cluster repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window not going up or down, or moving very slowly.
    *   Solution: Replace the window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Liftgate Glass Hinge Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear liftgate glass detaching from the hinge, making it difficult or impossible to open or close properly.
    *   Solution: Replace the hinges or the entire liftgate glass assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent temperature control, with hot air blowing from one side and cold air from the other. Clicking noises behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator. This can be a labor-intensive job due to its location behind the dashboard.
