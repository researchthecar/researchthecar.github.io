The 2011 Ford Explorer marked a significant redesign, moving from a traditional body-on-frame SUV to a car-based crossover platform. While praised for its improved ride quality, fuel economy (relative to previous generations), and modern interior, the 2011 Explorer has had its share of issues. Engine options included a 3.5L V6 producing approximately 290 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque, and a later introduction of a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 which is less common. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often appreciate the Explorer's spacious cabin and comfortable seating, but common complaints revolve around the MyFord Touch infotainment system, potential drivetrain problems, and some electrical glitches.

**Summary:**

The 2011 Ford Explorer, while a popular choice for its features and design, has several common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 3.5L V6 (timing chain, water pump), can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues are also prevalent and can lead to costly rebuilds. Electrical problems, like MyFord Touch malfunctions, are frustrating for owners. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures. The cost to address these problems can vary widely, but some repairs can easily exceed $3,000. Checking vehicle history reports and having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a trusted mechanic are highly recommended for potential buyers.
