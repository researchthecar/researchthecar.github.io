Popular engine choices include the 4.0L V6 and 4.6L V8, while transmission options include a 5-speed automatic and a 6-speed automatic. The Explorer is praised for its spacious interior, powerful engines, and off-road capabilities. However, it has also been known to have some common issues.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

* **Timing chain failure:** The timing chain can stretch or break, causing the engine to lose power or stall. Replacement of the timing chain and related components is necessary. Estimated cost: $1,500 - $2,500+

**4.6L V8**

* **Spark plug blowout:** The spark plugs can blow out of the cylinder head, causing engine damage. Replacement of the spark plugs and cylinder head is often required. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing a vacuum leak and reduced engine performance. Replacement of the gasket is typically required. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000

**Transmission**

**5-speed Automatic**

* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoids can fail, causing the transmission to shift erratically or not shift at all. Replacement of the shift solenoids is necessary. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,500

**6-speed Automatic**

* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter can develop a shudder, causing vibration and noise during acceleration. Replacement of the torque converter is typically required. Estimated cost: $1,000 - $2,000

**Suspension**

* **Front lower ball joint failure:** The front lower ball joints can fail, causing the vehicle to become unstable and difficult to steer. Replacement of the ball joints is required. Estimated cost: $500 - $1,000 per side

**Summary**

The 2005 Ford Explorer has a range of common issues that vary in severity and repair cost. Engine problems, including timing chain failure and intake manifold gasket failure, are some of the most serious and expensive issues reported. Transmission issues, such as shift solenoid failure and torque converter shudder, are also relatively common and can be costly to fix. Overall, the Explorer has some significant reliability issues that potential buyers should be aware of before purchasing.
