The 2022 Ford Explorer is a popular SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available technology. It offers several engine options: a 2.3L EcoBoost I4 producing 300 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L EcoBoost V6 producing 400 hp and 415 lb-ft of torque (on ST models, lower on others), and a 3.3L hybrid V6. All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Explorer's updated infotainment system, roomy third row (compared to some competitors), and towing capacity. Common dislikes include perceived lower-quality interior materials for the price point, and some reported issues with the infotainment system.
