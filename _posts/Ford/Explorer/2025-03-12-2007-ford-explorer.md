The 2007 Ford Explorer is a mid-size SUV that offers a blend of utility and comfort. It was available with two engine options: a 4.0L V6 producing around 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.6L V8 generating approximately 292 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. The V6 engine was typically paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the V8 was coupled with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Explorer for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and towing capacity. Common dislikes included its fuel economy, especially with the V8, and reports of various mechanical and electrical issues.

**Engine**

**4.0L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Rattle/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A rattling noise, especially on startup, indicates wear or failure of the timing chain components, including the chain, tensioners, and guides. This can eventually lead to engine misfires, poor performance, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing chain, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough idling, check engine light activation (specifically codes related to camshaft position).
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty camshaft position sensor(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    * Recalls: None Found

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4.6L V8 engines in this era are known for spark plugs seizing in the cylinder heads. During spark plug replacement, the plugs can break, leaving part of the plug in the head.
    *   Solution: Specialized tools and techniques are required to extract the broken spark plugs. In severe cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed and professionally repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the number of broken plugs and the repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaking from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets and seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per leak location
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (4.0L V6)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, the transmission slipping out of gear, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid flush and filter change may help. However, more severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (4.6L V8)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    * Description/Symptoms: A shuddering or vibration felt at certain speeds, particularly when the transmission is in overdrive or under light acceleration.
    * Solution: A fluid flush with a specialized friction modifier additive can sometimes alleviate the problem. In more severe cases, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement/Harsh Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Noticeable delay when shifting into drive or reverse, harsh or jerky shifts between gears.
    * Solution: Could be caused by low fluid level, faulty shift solenoids, or internal transmission damage. Diagnosis is required to determine the appropriate repair, which could range from a fluid flush and filter change to a valve body repair or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid change) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the vehicle sits noticeably lower than the front, especially when loaded. This can be due to worn-out rear leaf springs or failing air suspension components (if equipped).
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear leaf springs or air suspension components (shocks/springs and compressor).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, excessive tire wear, loose steering.
    * Solution: Replacing the worn ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking noises behind the dashboard, inconsistent temperature control, with one side of the vehicle blowing hot air and the other blowing cold.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blend door actuator(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Window fails to go up or down, or moves very slowly.
    * Solution: Replacing the power window motor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+ per window
    * Recalls: None Found
