The 2002 Ford Explorer was a popular SUV known for its truck-like build and decent off-road capabilities. It came with several engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 4.0L SOHC V6 producing around 210 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 4.6L SOHC V8, making approximately 240 horsepower and 282 lb-ft of torque, was also available. The transmissions offered were a 5-speed automatic and a 5-speed manual (only with the 4.0L). Owners generally liked the Explorer's spaciousness, towing capacity, and relatively simple mechanics. Common complaints often revolved around fuel economy, certain reliability issues, and the overall age of the vehicle now.
