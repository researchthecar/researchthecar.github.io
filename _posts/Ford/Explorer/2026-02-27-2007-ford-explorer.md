### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford Explorer presents a mixed reliability profile. The V6 and V8 engines have known issues like intake manifold leaks and camshaft sensor failures, respectively, which can be costly to repair. The automatic transmission is also a point of concern, with solenoid pack and torque converter problems being relatively common. Suspension components, particularly ball joints, tie rod ends, and rear shocks, are also prone to wear and require attention. Electrical issues, such as window regulators and instrument clusters, can add to the ownership costs. While the exterior and interior generally hold up well, potential buyers should be aware of these mechanical and electrical vulnerabilities and factor in potential repair costs.
