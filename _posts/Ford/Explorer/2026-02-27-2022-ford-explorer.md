### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Ford Explorer generally presents a solid reliability record, with most major mechanical components like the engine options (2.3L EcoBoost, 3.0L EcoBoost V6, 3.3L Hybrid) showing no widespread issues. The primary areas of concern are the 10-speed automatic transmission, which can occasionally exhibit hesitation or rough shifting, often resolvable with software updates or fluid service. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system (freezing/unresponsiveness) and intermittent battery drain, are also noted, typically addressed through software fixes or diagnostic checks. Exterior and interior components are largely free from significant reported problems. Overall, while minor electrical and transmission quirks exist, they do not detract significantly from the Explorer's overall reliability for most owners.
