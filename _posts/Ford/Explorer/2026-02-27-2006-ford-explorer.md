### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford Explorer, while a popular choice, exhibits some common issues that owners should be aware of. The 4.0L V6 engine is more prone to spark plug blowout and intake manifold leaks than the 4.6L V8, which can experience camshaft sensor issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 5R55W/S, may develop problems with solenoids or the torque converter. Suspension components like ball joints and control arm bushings are also noted for wear. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module or instrument cluster, can manifest as various system malfunctions. Exteriorly, rear hatch struts can fail, and interiorly, HVAC blend door actuators are a common point of failure. Despite these potential issues, many 2006 Explorers remain on the road with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
