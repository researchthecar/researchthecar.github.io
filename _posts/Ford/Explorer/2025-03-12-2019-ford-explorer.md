The 2019 Ford Explorer marked the end of the fifth generation before a major redesign in 2020. It was generally praised for its spaciousness, comfortable ride, and available technology, but also received criticism for its smaller third-row seat and reported reliability issues. Engine options included a 2.3L EcoBoost I4 (300 hp, 310 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 (290 hp, 255 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (365 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque). All engine options came paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
