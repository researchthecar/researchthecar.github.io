### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford Explorer, particularly models equipped with the 4.0L V6 SOHC engine, can be prone to significant issues like timing chain and intake manifold problems. The automatic transmissions, especially the 5R55E, may experience solenoid or torque converter failures. Suspension components such as ball joints and leaf springs are also common wear items that require attention. Electrical gremlins, like window regulators and instrument clusters, can add to repair costs. Rust is a notable concern for the exterior, especially on the frame. While the 4.6L V8 engine appears more robust, overall reliability is mixed, with potential for substantial repair bills if these common issues arise.
