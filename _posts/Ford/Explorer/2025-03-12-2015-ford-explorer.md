**Summary**

The 2015 Ford Explorer can be a good vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues reported by owners. Engine problems, especially with the 3.5L V6 (water pump, timing chain) and 2.0L EcoBoost (coolant intrusion, turbo failure), can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, while not always catastrophic, can also be a source of frustration and expense. Electrical glitches, particularly with the door latches and MyFord Touch/Sync system, are also prevalent. The rear toe link recall should be verified as completed on any potential purchase. Overall, while some issues are relatively minor, others can be quite severe and costly, making a thorough inspection and maintenance history check crucial before buying a used 2015 Ford Explorer.
