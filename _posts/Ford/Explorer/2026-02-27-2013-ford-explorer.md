### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Ford Explorer demonstrates a generally solid reliability record, particularly with its 3.5L V6 engine. The most frequently cited issues tend to be related to the powertrain, specifically the 2.0L EcoBoost engine's potential for coolant leaks and turbocharger problems, and occasional transmission hesitation or overheating with the automatic gearbox. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components like strut mounts can require attention. However, many of these issues are manageable and not indicative of systemic failure across the entire model year. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate these potential problems.
