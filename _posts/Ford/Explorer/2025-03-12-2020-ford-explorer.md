The 2020 Ford Explorer marked the beginning of the sixth generation and a return to a rear-wheel-drive-based platform. Engine options included a 2.3L EcoBoost I4 producing 300 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L EcoBoost V6 available in two tunings (365 hp/380 lb-ft in most trims, 400 hp/415 lb-ft in the ST), and a 3.3L hybrid V6. All engines were paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Explorer's improved handling and updated interior, but common complaints included issues with the infotainment system, transmission glitches, and overall build quality.

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford Explorer had some significant issues, particularly with the 3.0L EcoBoost engine suffering coolant intrusion problems that could lead to engine failure, and harsh transmission shifting due to the 10R80 transmission. Electrical problems, specifically with the infotainment system, were also common and frustrating for owners. Water leaks and general comfort issues further compounded the issues. While some problems can be addressed with software updates, the more serious engine and transmission issues can be very costly to repair. Overall, the severity of the potential problems ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
