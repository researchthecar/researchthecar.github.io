### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford Explorer presents a mixed reliability profile. The V6 and V8 engines, while generally capable, have known issues like spark plug blowout and intake manifold leaks for the 4.0L, and camshaft sensor issues for the 4.6L. The 5-speed automatic transmission can experience problems with the torque converter and solenoid pack. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and control arms, may require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM malfunctions and premature alternator failure, are also reported. Exterior issues are minor, like failing hatch struts, and interior climate control can be affected by blend door actuator problems. Overall, while not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these specific potential repair areas.
