### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Ford Explorer, while a popular choice, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and design. The 4.0L V6 engines, particularly the OHV variant, are prone to intake manifold gasket leaks and timing chain wear. The SOHC version can suffer from camshaft synchronizer and head gasket problems. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4R55E, may develop issues with the torque converter clutch or solenoid packs. Suspension components like ball joints and radius arm bushings are also wear items that require attention. Electrical gremlins, such as instrument cluster and window motor failures, are not uncommon. Frame rust can be a significant concern in areas with harsh winters. Overall, while not plagued by a single catastrophic failure, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these specific components.
