The 2014 Ford Explorer is a popular SUV known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available third-row seating. The 2014 model offers three engine options: a 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 producing 290 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 (available on FWD models only) producing 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 in the Sport and Platinum trims producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Explorer's practicality and family-friendly features. However, some common complaints include issues with the MyFord Touch infotainment system, powertrain malfunctions, and potential suspension problems.

**Engine**

**3.5L Ti-VCT V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Internal water pump failing, leading to coolant leaking into the engine oil. This can cause overheating, engine damage, and potential engine failure. Symptoms include coolant loss, engine overheating, and a milky appearance of the engine oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the internal water pump. It's also recommended to replace the timing chain and related components as they are often affected by coolant contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.0L EcoBoost I4**

*   **Coolant Intrusion Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the cylinder head can allow coolant to leak into the combustion chamber. This can cause white smoke from the exhaust, engine misfires, and potentially catastrophic engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cylinder head. In severe cases, the entire engine may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Failure of the turbochargers due to oil starvation or other mechanical issues. Symptoms include a loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, and unusual noises from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed turbocharger(s). It's important to diagnose the cause of the failure to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6F35/6F50/6F55 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic or harsh shifting between gears. Transmission slipping, especially during acceleration. Can be caused by wear in the valve body or internal components.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, the solution can range from a transmission fluid flush and filter change to a valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (fluid flush) - $4,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This can be caused by worn-out stabilizer bar bushings, struts, or control arm bushings.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on which parts need replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **MyFord Touch/MyLincoln Touch Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or unresponsive touchscreen. Bluetooth connectivity problems. Navigation system malfunctions. System crashes and reboots.
    *   Solution: Update the software to the latest version. If problems persist, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 (Software update) - $500 - $1200+ (APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Liftgate Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate fails to open or close properly, or it operates erratically. This can be caused by a faulty liftgate motor, struts, or sensor.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty liftgate motor, struts, or sensor.

**Summary:**

The 2014 Ford Explorer, while generally a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, particularly coolant intrusion on the 2.0L EcoBoost and water pump failure on the 3.5L V6, can be expensive to repair. Transmission issues, mainly harsh shifting and slipping, are also a concern. Electrical problems with the MyFord Touch system can be frustrating, and suspension and power liftgate malfunctions can add to the ownership costs. Overall, while many Explorers remain trouble-free, it's wise to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems and negotiate accordingly. The severity and cost of repairs can vary significantly depending on the specific issue and the extent of the damage.
