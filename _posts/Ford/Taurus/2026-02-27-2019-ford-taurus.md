### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Ford Taurus presents a reliability picture that requires careful consideration, particularly concerning its powertrain options. The EcoBoost engines, while offering performance, have documented issues with turbochargers and cooling systems. The naturally aspirated V6 is more prone to timing chain and intake manifold problems. The 6-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting irregularities and torque converter issues. Electrical gremlins, especially with the SYNC infotainment system and parasitic battery drain, are also noted concerns. However, the suspension, exterior, and interior components generally hold up well. Prospective buyers should prioritize vehicles with thorough maintenance records and be prepared for potential repair costs related to the engine and transmission.
