### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Ford Taurus presents a generally reliable profile, with most reported issues concentrated in specific powertrain components, particularly the EcoBoost engines and the automatic transmission. Owners may encounter problems with turbochargers, timing chains, and transmission shifting. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and parasitic battery drain, are also noted. Suspension components like struts can wear over time, and interior climate control actuators are a common point of failure. While not overwhelmingly problematic, potential buyers should be aware of these specific areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection to assess their condition.
