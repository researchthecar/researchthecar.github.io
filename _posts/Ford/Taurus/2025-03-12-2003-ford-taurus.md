The 2003 Ford Taurus was a mid-size sedan known for its comfortable ride and spacious interior. Engine options included a 3.0L Vulcan V6 producing 155 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L Duratec 24V V6 producing 201 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised its reliability and ease of maintenance but disliked its somewhat dated styling and fuel economy compared to newer models.

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford Taurus presents a mix of common issues, ranging from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing coil packs or sway bar links to more costly repairs such as transmission issues or rust repair. While some problems like intake manifold leaks and coolant leaks are more prevalent on the Vulcan engine, the Duratec engine has its own set of potential issues. Addressing these problems proactively can help maintain the vehicle's reliability and longevity. Severity ranges from mild inconvenience to major mechanical failure, and repair costs vary widely depending on the specific issue and the shop performing the work.
