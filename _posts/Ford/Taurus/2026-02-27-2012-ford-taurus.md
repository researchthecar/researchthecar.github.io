### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford Taurus presents a generally reliable package, particularly in its suspension, exterior, and interior components, which show no widespread reported issues. The primary areas of concern revolve around the powertrain, specifically the engines and transmissions. Owners of the 3.5L V6 and 2.0L EcoBoost engines should be aware of potential coolant leaks and, in the case of the EcoBoost, turbocharger issues. The 6-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and battery drain, are also noted. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these issues can be costly to repair, making proactive maintenance and awareness of these potential weak points advisable for prospective buyers or current owners.
