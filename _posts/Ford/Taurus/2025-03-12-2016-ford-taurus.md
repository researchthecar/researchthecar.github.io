The 2016 Ford Taurus is a full-size sedan that offers a spacious interior and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 producing 288 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 producing 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (SHO) producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Taurus for its roomy cabin and large trunk, but some dislike its dated styling and fuel economy. The 2016 Taurus is known for having a good amount of space, and the SHO model has great power. However, the base V6 fuel economy isn't the best and the car is pretty heavy.
