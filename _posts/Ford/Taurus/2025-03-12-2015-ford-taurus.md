The 2015 Ford Taurus is a full-size sedan that offers a spacious interior and comfortable ride. It was available with three engine options: a 3.5L V6 producing 288 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 generating 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 in the SHO model boasting 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People often appreciate the Taurus for its roomy cabin, smooth highway cruising, and available all-wheel drive. However, some criticisms include its large size making it less agile in city driving, the fuel economy of the V6 engines, and some dated interior elements.
