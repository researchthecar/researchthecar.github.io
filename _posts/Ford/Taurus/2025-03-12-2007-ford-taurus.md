The 2007 Ford Taurus marked a return of the nameplate after a brief hiatus, representing a significant refresh from previous generations. It was available with two engine options: a 3.5L Duratec 35 V6 producing around 263 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L Duratec 30 V6 producing around 203 horsepower and 207 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with the Ford/GM 6F50 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Taurus for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and reliability (compared to some competitors), but some disliked its somewhat bland styling and less-than-stellar fuel economy.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford Taurus, while generally considered a reliable vehicle, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly with the throttle body on the 3.5L and coil packs/camshaft synchronizer on the 3.0L, can lead to drivability problems and moderate repair costs. Transmission problems, especially torque converter and valve body issues on the 6F50 transmission, can be more expensive to address. Suspension issues are typical for a vehicle of this age, and electrical glitches can be annoying. Rust can also be a concern in certain climates. Overall, the severity and cost of these potential problems vary, but a thorough inspection before purchase is recommended.
