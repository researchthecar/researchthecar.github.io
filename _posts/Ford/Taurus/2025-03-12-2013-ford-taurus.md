Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2013 Ford Taurus, organized by category and powertrain option, following your specified format.

The 2013 Ford Taurus is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available all-wheel drive. It offered three engine choices: a 3.5L V6 producing 288 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, a 2.0L EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder making 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, and a high-performance 3.5L EcoBoost V6 in the SHO model, delivering 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's roomy cabin and smooth highway cruising, but some criticize its large size, limited rear visibility, and relatively low fuel economy, especially with the V6 engines.

**Summary**

The 2013 Ford Taurus can be a comfortable and spacious sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, especially those related to the engine and transmission. The water pump issue on both the 3.5L V6 and the 3.5L EcoBoost can be costly, and the coolant intrusion issue in the 2.0L EcoBoost can lead to catastrophic engine failure. Transmission issues, particularly with the torque converter and valve body, are also prevalent. Electrical gremlins with the battery and SYNC system can be frustrating. While not all vehicles will experience these problems, a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended. The severity and cost of repairs can range from minor fixes under a few hundred dollars to major engine or transmission overhauls costing several thousand.
