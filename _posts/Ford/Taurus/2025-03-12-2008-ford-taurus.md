The 2008 Ford Taurus marked a significant redesign for the model, attempting to revive its popularity in the full-size sedan market. It was offered with a single engine option, the 3.5L Duratec 35 V6, producing around 263 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6F50 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the car for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and relatively quiet cabin. Criticisms typically centered on fuel economy (for a V6), perceived lack of styling excitement, and some reported issues with reliability.

**Engine**

**3.5L Duratec 35 V6**

* **Timing Chain Wear/Stretching**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine rattling noise, especially on startup, and potentially leading to misfires and poor performance. Can result in the check engine light illuminating with codes related to timing.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chains, tensioners, and guides.

    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the front of the engine, overheating, and potential engine damage. The water pump is internally mounted and driven by the timing chain, making replacement more complex.
    * Solution: Replacement of the water pump, which requires extensive disassembly to access. May also be wise to replace timing chain components at the same time due to the labor involved.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Coil Pack Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires and poor performance. Check engine light will illuminate.
    * Solution: Replacement of the failed coil pack.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6F50 6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque Converter Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during gear changes, especially at lower speeds. Possible slipping or failure to engage gears.
    * Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the torque converter. It's also advisable to flush the transmission fluid and inspect for debris.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,800+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, and potential slipping.

**Suspension**

* **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noise from the front suspension when turning or going over bumps. Worn or cracked strut mounts.

**Summary**

The 2008 Ford Taurus, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, can be prone to certain mechanical and electrical issues. Engine problems, especially related to the timing chain and water pump, are potentially costly to repair. Transmission issues, while not universal, can also be expensive. Electrical faults like power window and blend door actuator failures are relatively common. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and have any prospective vehicle thoroughly inspected. The severity of potential issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs that could cost several thousand dollars.
