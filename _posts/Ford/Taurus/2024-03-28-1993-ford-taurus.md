**Introduction to the 1993 Ford Taurus**

The 1993 Ford Taurus was a midsize sedan that ran from 1992-1995. It came standard with a 3.0L Vulcan V6 engine that produced 140 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. It was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Optional engine and transmission options included a 3.8L Essex V6 engine with 160 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque, and a 5-speed manual transmission. People liked the Taurus for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordability. However, it was criticized for its lackluster performance and poor fuel economy.

**Engine**
