The 2010 Ford Taurus marked a significant redesign, aiming to revitalize Ford's full-size sedan offering. Engine options included a 3.5L Duratec V6 engine producing 263 horsepower and 249 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6F50 6-speed automatic transmission. For the SHO (Super High Output) model, there was a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6, producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, paired with the 6F55 6-speed automatic transmission. The Taurus was generally praised for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available technology, but some owners found its large size cumbersome, and the fuel economy of the standard V6 was not class-leading. Common complaints often revolved around electrical issues and some powertrain quirks, while many appreciated the car's overall value and safety features.

**Engine**

**3.5L Duratec V6**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks often originate from the water pump or the thermostat housing. Symptoms include low coolant levels, overheating, and visible coolant puddles under the vehicle.

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature sagging of the rear suspension, leading to a lower ride height and potentially affecting handling.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear springs and possibly the shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford Taurus, while a comfortable and spacious sedan, does have some common issues. Engine and transmission problems, while not universally prevalent, can be costly, especially concerning turbocharger failure in the SHO models. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the SYNC system, can be frustrating. Suspension sagging and water leaks are also worth noting. While many of these issues may not affect every vehicle, potential buyers should be aware of them and thoroughly inspect any used Taurus before purchase. The severity of the issues varies, with estimated repair costs ranging from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand for major component replacements.
