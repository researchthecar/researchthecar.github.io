**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Taurus can be a comfortable and spacious vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine problems, particularly with the water pump on the 3.5L V6 and coolant intrusion on the 2.0L EcoBoost, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues are also a concern across all engine options. Electrical gremlins with the SYNC system and door ajar sensors can be frustrating. Overall, while many Tauruses are reliable, it's wise to have any prospective purchase inspected by a mechanic to check for these potential problems and factor in potential repair costs.
