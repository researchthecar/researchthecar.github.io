**Engine**

**3.0L Vulcan V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak from the intake manifold gasket, leading to overheating, white smoke from the exhaust, and low coolant levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.

**3.0L Duratec 24V V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise from the engine, particularly on startup. Can lead to timing chain slippage and potential engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioners, guides, and potentially the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
