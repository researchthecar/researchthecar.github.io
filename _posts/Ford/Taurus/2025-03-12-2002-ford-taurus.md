The 2002 Ford Taurus was a mid-size sedan known for its practicality, comfort, and affordability. Engine options included a 3.0L Vulcan OHV V6 producing approximately 155 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque and a 3.0L Duratec DOHC V6, generating around 200 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Taurus for its spacious interior, smooth ride, and straightforward maintenance. Common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly concerning the transmission and certain electrical components, as well as its somewhat bland styling and driving experience.
