Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2018 Ford Taurus, categorized by component and including details on symptoms, solutions, and estimated costs.

The 2018 Ford Taurus is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. It was offered with three engine options: a 3.5L V6 (288 hp, 254 lb-ft torque), a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 (240 hp, 270 lb-ft torque) , and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (365 hp, 350 lb-ft torque) available only in the SHO model. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the Taurus for its roomy cabin, large trunk, and smooth highway cruising. However, some common complaints include the dated design, fuel economy of the V6, and the challenging visibility due to its high beltline and thick pillars.
