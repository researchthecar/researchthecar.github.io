**Summary**

The 2012 Ford Taurus, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, does have some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems range from coolant leaks and turbocharger issues to more serious problems like water pump failure in the EcoBoost V6 and coolant intrusion in the EcoBoost I4, potentially leading to significant repair costs. Transmission problems, such as harsh shifting, slipping, and torque converter issues, can also lead to expensive repairs. Suspension issues, such as strut mount failure, are relatively common and contribute to handling problems and noise. Electrical issues, like MyFord Touch system malfunctions and door lock actuator failures, can be frustrating. Exterior issues, such as water leaks in the trunk, and interior issues like sunroof and heated seat malfunctions, can further add to the cost of ownership. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially exceeding several thousand dollars, depending on the problem.
