**Introduction:**

The 2014 Ford Taurus is a full-size sedan available with a choice of three engine options: a 2.0L EcoBoost I-4, a 3.5L V6, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6. The 2.0L EcoBoost produces 240 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque, while the 3.5L V6 produces 288 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The 3.5L EcoBoost V6 generates 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All three engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, with the EcoBoost versions receiving a SelectShift manual mode.

Owners report that the Taurus offers a comfortable ride, spacious interior, and a powerful engine lineup. However, there have been some concerns regarding reliability.

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBoost I-4**

* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can fail due to a faulty wastegate actuator or a damaged impeller. Symptoms include loss of power, excessive smoke, and increased oil consumption. Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
* **Timing chain tensioner failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to slip and potentially damage the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise at start-up and a loss of power. Solution: Replacement of the timing chain tensioner and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+

**3.5L V6**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, allowing coolant to leak into the engine. Symptoms include a coolant leak, overheating, and a loss of power. Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold gasket. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
* **Cam phaser failure:** The cam phasers, which adjust the timing of the engine's valves, can fail. Symptoms include rough idling, reduced engine power, and increased fuel consumption. Solution: Replacement of the cam phasers and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

* **Turbocharger failure:** Similar to the 2.0L EcoBoost, the turbochargers on the 3.5L EcoBoost can fail due to wastegate actuator or impeller issues. Symptoms include loss of power, excessive smoke, and increased oil consumption. Solution: Replacement of the turbochargers and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Fuel injector failure:** The fuel injectors can fail, causing the engine to run lean or rich. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation during acceleration, and reduced fuel economy. Solution: Replacement of the fuel injectors. Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Torque converter shudder:** The torque converter can develop a shuddering sensation during acceleration or when coming to a stop. Symptoms include a noticeable vibration in the cabin. Solution: Replacement of the torque converter and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Transmission fluid leak:** The transmission can develop leaks, leading to a loss of fluid and potential damage to the transmission components. Symptoms include a lack of response from the transmission and a burning smell. Solution: Repair or replacement of the faulty component. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+

**Suspension**

* **Strut failure:** The front struts can fail, resulting in knocking or clunking noises over bumps and dips. Symptoms include a rough ride and reduced handling. Solution: Replacement of the struts and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
* **Sway bar link failure:** The sway bar links can fail, causing a rattling noise and reduced stability during cornering. Symptoms include a clunking or rattling sound over uneven surfaces. Solution: Replacement of the sway bar links. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** Some owners have reported a parasitic battery drain, leading to a dead battery after periods of non-use. Symptoms include a weak battery that drains quickly. Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the electrical system to identify the source of the drain. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
* **Electrical harness damage:** The electrical harness can be damaged by rodents or other external factors, causing electrical issues. Symptoms vary depending on the affected circuit. Solution: Repair or replacement of the damaged harness. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Door handle failure:** The door handles can fail due to broken internal components. Symptoms include difficulty opening or closing the doors. Solution: Replacement of the door handle assembly. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
* **Trunk latch failure:** The trunk latch can fail, preventing the trunk from opening or closing properly. Symptoms include a stuck trunk that cannot be opened or closed. Solution: Replacement of the trunk latch and related components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+

**Interior**

* **Climate control failure:** The climate control system can fail, resulting in malfunctioning HVAC functions. Symptoms include lack of heating or cooling, strange noises, or inconsistent temperature control. Solution: Diagnosis and repair of the climate control system components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+
* **SYNC system glitches:** The SYNC infotainment system can experience glitches or malfunctions, leading to issues with audio, navigation, and communication. Symptoms include frozen screens, unresponsive touchscreens, or intermittent connection issues. Solution: Software updates or hardware replacements. Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $500+

**Summary:**

The 2014 Ford Taurus has a variety of reported issues, with some being more severe and costly than others. Engine and transmission problems are among the most prevalent, with turbocharger failures and transmission fluid leaks being common concerns. Suspension and electrical issues are also present, but less frequently. The interior and exterior issues tend to be less severe but can still be inconvenient. Overall, the Taurus's reliability has been a concern for some owners, with repairs potentially costing hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
