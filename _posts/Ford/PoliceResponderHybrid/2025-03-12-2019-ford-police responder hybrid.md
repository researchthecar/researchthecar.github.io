The 2019 Ford Police Responder Hybrid is a specially designed sedan for law enforcement use, offering a blend of fuel efficiency and performance. It is equipped with a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle I-4 hybrid engine, delivering a combined system output of 190 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Unlike civilian Ford Fusion Hybrids, the Police Responder Hybrid is known for its heavier-duty components designed to withstand the rigors of police work. Owners often appreciate its fuel economy and relatively low maintenance costs compared to traditional V6-powered police vehicles. However, some common complaints revolve around the complexity of the hybrid system, potential battery issues, and the limitations in performance compared to traditional police interceptors.

**Body**

*   **Water Leak at Roof Seam**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaks into the cabin, typically around the headliner and A-pillars, during heavy rain or car washes. The source is often traced to the factory seam sealer failing at the roof joints.
    *   Solution: Remove headliner, clean the affected seam, apply new seam sealer, and repaint if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **HV Battery Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced electric-only range, decreased fuel economy, warning lights related to the hybrid system, and eventual inability to start the vehicle. Often caused by cell degradation within the high-voltage battery pack.
    *   Solution: Replacement or reconditioning of the high-voltage battery pack.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (depending on new vs. refurbished battery)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the power door locks. Often affects one or more doors, making it difficult or impossible to lock/unlock the vehicle remotely.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per door
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Accessory Wiring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the additional electrical load from police equipment (lights, sirens, radios, computers), the factory wiring harness may experience issues such as blown fuses, shorts, or overheating.
    *   Solution: Inspect the wiring harness, repair or replace damaged sections, and ensure proper grounding. Possibly upgrading the gauge of the wiring to handle the extra load.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Engine**

**2.0L Atkinson-Cycle I-4 Hybrid**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from various points in the engine, including hoses, water pump, and radiator. This can lead to overheating and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair the leak. Replace hoses, clamps, or the water pump as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on location and part)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**Electronic Continuously Variable Transmission (eCVT)**

*   **Transmission Shudder/Vibration**
    * Description/Symptoms: The eCVT sometimes exhibits a shudder or vibration during acceleration, particularly at lower speeds. This may be caused by worn clutches within the eCVT or programming issues.
    * Solution: A transmission flush may alleviate the problem in some cases. If the issue persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 (flush), $3,000 - $6,000+ (rebuild/replace)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pitched Whining Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of a high-pitched whining noise coming from the transmission, especially noticeable at lower speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a fluid change has helped reduce or eliminate the noise. If it persists, it could indicate internal wear or damage, requiring a transmission inspection.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 (fluid change), $1,000+ (transmission inspection/repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Frame Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of seat frame fatigue and cracking, especially in the driver's seat due to frequent use and entry/exit.
    *   Solution: Welding repair or replacement of the seat frame.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Suspension Component Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the added weight of police equipment and the demands of aggressive driving, components like shocks, struts, and ball joints may wear out faster than in a standard passenger vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford Police Responder Hybrid offers fuel efficiency but is subject to several potential issues stemming from its hybrid system and the demands of police use. The most significant concern is high-voltage battery failure, a costly repair. Coolant leaks, wiring issues, and premature suspension wear are also prevalent. The whining noise in the transmission may require future intervention. Most of the issues do not seem extremely severe and only require replacing the part, but the high cost of the battery repair makes it a significant issue.
