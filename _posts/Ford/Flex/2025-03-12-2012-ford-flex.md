The 2012 Ford Flex is a unique, boxy crossover known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. Available engine options include a 3.5L V6 producing approximately 262 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6, a turbocharged option that boosts performance to around 355 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Flex for its ample cargo space, comfortable seating, and available features like a multi-panel Vista Roof. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy, particularly with the EcoBoost engine, and certain reliability concerns.
