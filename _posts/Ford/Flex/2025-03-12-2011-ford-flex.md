The 2011 Ford Flex is a unique and spacious crossover SUV known for its distinctive boxy styling and comfortable ride. Engine options for the 2011 Flex include a 3.5L V6 producing around 262 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6, generating approximately 355 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Flex's generous passenger and cargo space, as well as its available features like a panoramic sunroof and rear entertainment system. Some common dislikes include its polarizing styling and potentially high fuel consumption, especially with the EcoBoost engine.
