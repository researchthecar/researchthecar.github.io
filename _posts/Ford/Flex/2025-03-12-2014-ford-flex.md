The 2014 Ford Flex is a full-size crossover SUV known for its spacious interior, distinctive boxy styling, and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 3.5L V6 producing 287 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 generating 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Flex's ample cargo space, comfortable seating for adults in all three rows, and unique exterior design. Common complaints include the fuel economy of the EcoBoost engine and some concerns about reliability, particularly with certain components.
