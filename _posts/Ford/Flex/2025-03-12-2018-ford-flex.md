The 2018 Ford Flex is a full-size crossover SUV known for its spaciousness, distinctive boxy styling, and comfortable ride. It came standard with a 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 engine producing around 287 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. An optional 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine, generating approximately 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, was also available, mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally like the Flex for its ample passenger and cargo space, unique design, and comfortable highway cruising. Common dislikes include its somewhat dated interior, fuel economy, and large size which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces.
