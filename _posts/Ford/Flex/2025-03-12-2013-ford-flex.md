The 2013 Ford Flex is a full-size crossover SUV known for its distinctive boxy design, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. Engine options include a 3.5L V6 engine producing 287 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, as well as a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine generating 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Flex for its ample cargo space, comfortable seating, and unique styling. Common dislikes include its somewhat polarizing exterior design and potentially lower fuel economy, especially with the EcoBoost engine.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, engine overheating, and a potential loss of engine power. Often, the water pump will start to make noise before it fails.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump and associated components (belts, hoses, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1000+

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, unusual noises from the engine bay, and the engine may go into limp mode.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger(s) and inspect associated components (lines, intercooler, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2000 - $4000+ (depending on if one or both turbos need replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6F50)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
