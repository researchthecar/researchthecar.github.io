The 2016 Ford Flex is a full-size crossover SUV known for its distinctive boxy styling, spacious interior, and comfortable ride. It was offered with two engine options: a 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 engine producing 287 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the Flex for its ample passenger and cargo space, comfortable ride, and unique styling.
