The 2017 Ford Flex is a unique and spacious crossover known for its distinctive boxy styling and comfortable ride. Engine options for the 2017 model year include a 3.5L Ti-VCT V6 engine producing 287 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque and a more powerful 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Flex for its ample passenger and cargo space, its smooth ride, and its distinctive styling. Common complaints include its dated infotainment system, fuel economy, and large size, which can make it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford Flex, while generally reliable, can be susceptible to certain issues. The most concerning issues relate to the 3.5L EcoBoost engine, particularly coolant intrusion, which can lead to major engine damage and high repair costs. Other issues, such as transmission problems and electrical glitches, are more common and can range in severity and cost. The SYNC system issues are a common complaint but generally do not affect the vehicle's mechanical operation. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and factor them into their purchasing decision. A pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic is highly recommended to assess the overall condition of the vehicle and identify any existing or potential issues.
