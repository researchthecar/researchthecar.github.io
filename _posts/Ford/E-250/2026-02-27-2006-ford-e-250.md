### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Ford E-250 is a workhorse van that generally offers good reliability, especially with its gasoline V8 engines. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as spark plug blowouts and intake manifold gasket leaks on the Triton V8s, and more significant concerns like EGR cooler and head gasket failures on the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel. Transmission issues, particularly torque converter problems and overheating, can also arise. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs may require attention over time. Electrical components like alternators and interior parts like blower motors are also noted for occasional failure. Regular maintenance and addressing these common issues promptly can ensure the continued serviceability of the E-250.
