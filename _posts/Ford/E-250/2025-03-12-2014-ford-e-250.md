**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can loosen or eject from the cylinder head, causing a misfire, rough running, and potential damage to the cylinder head threads. A ticking sound may also be heard.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head. Some shops use thread repair inserts (e.g., Time-Sert) as a more cost-effective alternative to head replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage/Ejection**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, the 5.4L engine is also known for spark plugs loosening or ejecting, leading to misfires, rough idle, and potential damage to the cylinder head threads.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head. Thread repair inserts are also commonly used.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ depending on the extent of the damage and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues (if equipped with variable valve timing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, rattling noise upon startup, loss of power, and potential engine stalling. These symptoms can occur due to worn or malfunctioning cam phasers.
    *   Solution: Replace the cam phasers, timing chain, and related components.
