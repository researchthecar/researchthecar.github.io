### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford E-250 is a generally reliable vehicle, particularly its powertrains when properly maintained. The most common issues tend to be related to the spark plug blowout on V10 and V8 engines, and intake manifold gasket leaks on V6 and V10 models. Transmission issues, while not rampant, can occur, with solenoid failures and overheating being notable. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the vehicle's nature. Electrical components such as alternators and window regulators can also fail. Rust is a concern for exterior panels. Overall, the E-250 is a capable van, but owners should be aware of these potential repair areas, especially as the vehicle ages.
