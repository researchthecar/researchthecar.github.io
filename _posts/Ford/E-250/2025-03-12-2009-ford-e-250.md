The 2009 Ford E-250 is a full-size cargo van, prized for its reliability and utility. It was available with two engine options: a 4.6L Triton V8 producing 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.4L Triton V8 producing 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically appreciate the E-250's robust build, large cargo capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design, making it easy to repair. Downsides often mentioned include relatively poor fuel economy and a somewhat dated interior.

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford E-250, while a durable workhorse, has its share of common issues. The spark plug thread issue with both V8 engines is a well-known problem and can be costly. The 5.4L's cam phaser issues are another potential high-cost repair. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are prone to wear and can affect handling. Electrical issues, particularly with door lock actuators and alternators, can also arise. Rust is a concern, especially in colder climates. Overall, while the E-250 is generally reliable, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in repair costs when evaluating a purchase. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs costing several thousand dollars.
