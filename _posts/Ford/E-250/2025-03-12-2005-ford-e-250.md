**Summary**

The 2005 Ford E-250, while generally reliable, is prone to age-related issues common to vehicles of its era. Engine issues, particularly spark plug blowout in the Triton V8 engines, can be costly. Rust is a significant concern, especially in regions with harsh winters. Suspension components wear out over time and require replacement. Electrical problems, often caused by corrosion, can be frustrating. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission work or extensive rust repair, can be quite costly. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for rust, check for engine noises or misfires, and have the transmission thoroughly evaluated before purchasing.
