The 2012 Ford E-250 is a popular cargo van known for its reliability and practicality, often used for commercial purposes. The 2012 E-250 offered a choice of two engines: the 4.6L Triton V8 producing 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque and the 5.4L Triton V8 generating 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the E-250's cargo capacity and durability. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy and the relatively basic interior features.
