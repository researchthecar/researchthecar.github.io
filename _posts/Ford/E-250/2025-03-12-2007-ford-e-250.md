The 2007 Ford E-250 is a full-size cargo van known for its robust construction and utilitarian design, making it a popular choice for commercial use. Engine options for the 2007 E-250 included a 4.2L Essex V6 engine, a 4.6L Triton V8 engine, and a 5.4L Triton V8 engine. The 4.6L engine produces around 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque. The 4.2L and 5.4L engines were also available but less commonly installed in these vans. The primary transmission option was a 4-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the E-250 for its payload capacity, reliability, and relative ease of maintenance, while common complaints often revolve around fuel economy and some specific component failures related to age and heavy use.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a common issue with the early Triton engines (including the 4.6L). Spark plugs can be ejected from the cylinder head due to insufficient thread engagement in the aluminum cylinder head. This can cause a loud popping noise, misfires, and potential damage to the ignition coil.
    *   Solution: Repair involves either installing thread inserts (like Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) or replacing the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the repair method and if a head replacement is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, or inconsistent engine speed at idle.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, spark plugs can be ejected from the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Similar repair methods as the 4.6L â€“ thread inserts or cylinder head replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the repair method).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Camshaft Phaser Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Engine knocking, rough idle, reduced power, and potential stalling. Often accompanied by a "check engine" light. This is more common in later model years of the Triton engine, but still possible on the 2007 model.
    * Solution: Replacement of the camshaft phasers, timing chain, and possibly other related components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Slipping or Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission slipping between gears, harsh or delayed shifts, or failure to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Could be due to low fluid, worn clutches, or valve body issues. Diagnosis requires a transmission inspection and possibly a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (for fluid and filter change) - $3000+ (for rebuild or replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds, stalling when coming to a stop, or abnormal noise coming from the transmission area.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Often recommended to replace the transmission filter and fluid at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends. It's recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging or Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially under load, or a noticeable crack or break in one of the leaf springs. Can cause poor ride quality and handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Often recommended to replace them in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found
