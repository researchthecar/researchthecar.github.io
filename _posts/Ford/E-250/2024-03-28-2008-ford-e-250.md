**Introduction**

The 2008 Ford E-250 is a full-size van offered in multiple configurations, including cargo and passenger versions. It is powered by one of three engines: a 4.6L V8, a 5.4L V8, or a 6.8L V10. Transmission options include a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual. The E-250 is known for its spacious interior, strong performance, and towing capabilities. However, it has also been reported to have several common issues.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

* **Spark Plug Failure:** Premature failure of spark plugs can lead to misfires and rough engine operation. Replacement cost: $120 - $250
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** A leaking intake manifold gasket can cause coolant and oil leaks, as well as reduced engine performance. Replacement cost: $300 - $600
* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** A faulty timing chain tensioner can lead to a noisy engine and potential engine damage. Replacement cost: $500 - $800+
* **Exhaust Manifold Bolt Failure:** Broken exhaust manifold bolts can cause leaks and reduced engine power. Replacement cost: $200 - $400

**5.4L V8**

* **Cam Phaser Failure:** Faulty cam phasers can cause engine noise, reduced power, and decreased fuel economy. Replacement cost: $1,000 - $2,000
* **Spark Plug Blowout:** Excessive heat can cause spark plugs to blow out of the engine head, leading to catastrophic engine damage. Replacement cost: $1,000 - $3,000+
* **Intake Manifold Runner Control Failure:** A faulty intake manifold runner control can cause reduced engine power and decreased fuel economy. Replacement cost: $300 - $600

**6.8L V10**

* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Faulty fuel injectors can cause engine misfires, rough idle, and reduced performance. Replacement cost: $500 - $1,000
* **Oil Filter Adapter Leak:** A leaking oil filter adapter can cause oil leaks and potential engine damage. Replacement cost: $200 - $400

**Transmission**

**Four-Speed Automatic (4R100)**

* **Slipping Gears:** Worn transmission components can cause the transmission to slip out of gear, resulting in loss of power. Replacement cost: $2,000 - $3,000+
* **Torque Converter Failure:** A faulty torque converter can cause shuddering, slipping, or overheating. Replacement cost: $800 - $1,200
* **Governor Pressure Sensor Failure:** A malfunctioning governor pressure sensor can lead to transmission shift problems and reduced performance. Replacement cost: $200 - $400
* **Speedometer Sensor Failure:** A faulty speedometer sensor can provide incorrect speed readings and affect transmission shifting. Replacement cost: $100 - $200

**Five-Speed Manual (NV4500)**

* **Clutch Failure:** Excessive wear or damage to the clutch can cause difficulty shifting or loss of power. Replacement cost: $500 - $800
* **Transmission Bearing Failure:** Worn transmission bearings can cause noisy operation, vibration, and potential transmission failure. Replacement cost: $1,000 - $2,000+
* **Synchronizer Failure:** Faulty synchronizers can make it difficult or impossible to shift gears smoothly. Replacement cost: $600 - $1,200
