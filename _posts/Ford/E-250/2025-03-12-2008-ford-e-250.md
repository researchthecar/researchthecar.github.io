The 2008 Ford E-250 is a popular cargo van known for its reliability and utility. Engine options included the 4.6L Triton V8 producing approximately 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque and the 5.4L Triton V8 which produces approximately 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. A 4-speed automatic transmission was the sole transmission option. Owners generally appreciate its spacious cargo area and durable workhorse capabilities, but some common complaints revolve around fuel economy and certain mechanical issues that arise with age.
