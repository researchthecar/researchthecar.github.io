The 2011 Ford E-250 is a full-size van popular for commercial use and passenger transport. It's known for its durability and spaciousness, but also criticized for its dated design and relatively poor fuel economy compared to newer vans. Engine options include the 4.6L Triton V8 (225 hp, 286 lb-ft of torque) and the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the E-250's reliability and cargo capacity, while some dislike the ride quality and limited technology.
