Here is a comprehensive list of common issues and complaints for the 2010 Ford E-250, categorized by major component and engine/transmission option. The 2010 Ford E-250 is a popular work van known for its reliability and utility, though it's not without its problems. The 2010 E-250 came with two engine options: the 4.6L Triton V8 producing approximately 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, and the 5.4L Triton V8 producing roughly 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the van's cargo capacity and robust build, but common complaints include relatively poor fuel economy and some reliability issues as the vehicle ages.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plugs Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs often seize in the cylinder head due to corrosion. When attempting to remove them, the spark plugs can break, leaving part of the plug stuck in the head.
    *   Solution: Special tools are required to extract the broken spark plug. Pre-soaking with penetrating oil can help. In severe cases, the cylinder head may need to be removed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the severity and whether the head needs to be removed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks can develop from various locations including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and front crankshaft seal. Visible oil drips and/or burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on location and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Roller Follower Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise from the top of the engine, rough running, loss of power. This may occur if the engine is not properly maintained or experiences oil starvation.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected roller followers and potentially camshaft(s).

**Summary**

The 2010 Ford E-250 can be a reliable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential issues. Engine issues, particularly with spark plug removal and oil leaks, are common. Transmission problems, especially with the 4-speed automatic, can be costly. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, such as alternator and door lock actuator failures, are also possibilities. Rust can be a concern in certain climates. While some of these issues are relatively minor, others can be expensive to repair, making thorough inspection and maintenance crucial for prospective buyers.
