### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ford F-450 Super Duty demonstrates solid reliability, especially considering its heavy-duty nature. The gasoline engine is generally trouble-free. The diesel engine, while powerful, can experience issues with fuel injectors and EGR coolers, which are common in high-mileage diesel applications. Transmission reliability is good, with the primary concern being torque converter shudder in the diesel variant. Suspension components like ball joints may require attention over time. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and sensor problems are not uncommon for a vehicle of this age and class. Interior and exterior components are largely robust, with minor issues like headlight condensation being the most frequently cited. Overall, the F-450 is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential diesel-specific powertrain maintenance and the possibility of wear on suspension parts.
