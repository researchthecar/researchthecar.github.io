**Summary**

The 2002 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a capable truck, but due to its age, it's prone to certain issues. Engine problems, especially related to the diesel injectors, spark plugs, and exhaust manifolds, can be costly. Transmission issues, particularly in the automatic models, are also common. Suspension wear is typical for a truck of this age. Rust can be a significant concern, depending on the vehicle's history and location.
