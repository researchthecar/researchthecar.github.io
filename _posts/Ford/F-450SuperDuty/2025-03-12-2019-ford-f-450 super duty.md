The 2019 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a heavy-duty truck known for its immense towing and hauling capabilities. Itâ€™s often praised for its powerful engine options and robust build. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of potential problems. Available engines include the 6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8, producing 385 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel, which delivers 450 horsepower and a staggering 935 lb-ft of torque. The 6.2L gasoline engine is paired with the TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission while the 6.7L diesel is paired with the TorqShift 6-speed automatic. Some common complaints about the F-450 include its large size, making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and its firm ride, especially when unloaded.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, excessive black smoke, unusual turbocharger noises (whining or screeching), check engine light illumination. Can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or excessive turbocharger usage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger assembly. Inspect and address the root cause of the failure to prevent recurrence (e.g., oil supply issues, air intake leaks).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, rough idling, white smoke upon startup. Can be caused by glow plug failure, glow plug controller malfunction, or wiring issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty glow plugs and/or glow plug controller. Diagnose and repair any associated wiring problems.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the number of plugs replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Low oil level warnings, needing to add oil frequently, blue smoke from exhaust (indicating oil burning). This can be caused by worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or PCV valve issues.
    * Solution: Perform an engine compression test to determine the extent of the wear. Depending on the severity, the solution could range from replacing the PCV valve to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV Valve) - $5000+ (Engine Rebuild/Replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts between gears, noticeable delays when shifting into drive or reverse. Can be caused by valve body issues, solenoid malfunctions, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the issue persists, further diagnostics are required to identify the faulty component (e.g., valve body, solenoid). Repair or replacement of the identified component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2,000+ (depending on the complexity of the repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Audible squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.  Caused by friction between the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the leaf spring contact points with a suitable grease or spray lubricant. If the squeaking persists or the springs are worn, replacement of the leaf springs may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (lubrication), $500 - $1500+ (leaf spring replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC infotainment system becomes unresponsive, freezes intermittently, or exhibits significant lag when performing functions.
    *   Solution: Perform a system reset or software update. If the issue persists, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset), $500 - $1200+ (APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Trailer Brake Controller Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent loss of trailer brake function, error messages related to the trailer brake controller, inability to adjust trailer brake gain.
    *   Solution: Check trailer wiring and connections. If the issue persists, inspect and/or replace the trailer brake controller module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion around wheel wells and body seams**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation is often seen around the wheel wells and along the body seams, especially in regions with heavy salt usage on the roads.
    *   Solution: Thorough cleaning and rust removal, followed by application of rust-resistant coatings or paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
