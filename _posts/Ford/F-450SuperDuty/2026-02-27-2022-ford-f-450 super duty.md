### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Ford F-450 Super Duty demonstrates commendable reliability, especially considering its heavy-duty nature. The gasoline V8 engines and the TorqShift transmissions are generally robust with no widespread critical failures reported. The primary areas of concern, as with many diesel trucks, revolve around the emissions control systems, specifically the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, which can require maintenance or repair under heavy use. Electrical components like the alternator and infotainment system have seen isolated reports of issues. Exterior and interior components are largely reliable, with minor reports of tailgate latch problems and HVAC blower motor failures. Overall, the F-450 is a dependable workhorse, but owners should be mindful of potential diesel emissions system maintenance and budget for occasional electrical repairs.
