The 2004 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a heavy-duty work truck known for its robust towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options for this model year included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the powerful 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 6.0L Power Stroke produces 325 horsepower and 570 lb-ft of torque. The 5.4L and 6.8L engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.0L diesel used a 5-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the truck's raw power and workhorse capabilities. Some common complaints revolve around the reliability of the 6.0L diesel engine, particularly its tendency for head gasket failures and injector problems.

**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potentially a blown head gasket. The EGR cooler is prone to cracking, allowing coolant to enter the intake system.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an updated design. Consider deleting the EGR system altogether (check local regulations).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, white or black smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy. The fuel injectors are susceptible to stiction (sticking) and failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty injectors. Consider using a fuel additive to help prevent stiction.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, bubbling in the coolant reservoir, and potentially oil in the coolant. The head bolts are prone to stretching, leading to head gasket failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the head gaskets with stronger aftermarket gaskets and ARP head studs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, stalling, lack of power, and a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) related to HPOP pressure.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPOP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**
*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs ejecting from the cylinder head, misfires, and loss of power. The cylinder heads have very few threads for the spark plugs, which are prone to stripping over time.
    *   Solution: Repair the spark plug threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing noise from the engine, especially when cold, reduced fuel economy. The exhaust manifold studs are prone to breaking, causing exhaust leaks.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken exhaust manifold studs. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic (5.4L & 6.8L)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, or complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic (6.0L)**

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifting, delayed engagement, slipping between gears. Valve body can wear out causing shifting issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, poor ride quality, and decreased load-carrying capacity. The leaf springs can sag over time, especially if the truck is frequently used for heavy loads.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider adding helper springs or air bags to increase load capacity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500 per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replace the ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **FICM (Fuel Injection Control Module) Failure (6.0L Diesel)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, stalling, lack of power, and a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) related to the FICM. The FICM provides the high voltage required to fire the fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace or repair the FICM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues (6.0L Diesel)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke on startup. The glow plugs assist in starting the engine in cold conditions.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty glow plugs and glow plug controller if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming on the rocker panels, cab corners, and wheel wells.
    *   Solution: Repair the rusted areas, which can include cutting out the rust and welding in new sheet metal, then painting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Cracked Dashboard**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks appearing on the dashboard, especially in areas exposed to sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replace the dashboard or install a dashboard cover.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Ford F-450 Super Duty, while a capable work truck, has its share of potential issues. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is the most problematic, with head gasket failures, EGR cooler issues, and injector problems being the most common. These repairs can be costly, with head gasket replacements potentially exceeding $6,000. The 5.4L V8 is more reliable overall, but spark plug thread damage is a potential issue. Suspension and electrical problems are also common across the model line. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the truck, especially the engine, for any signs of these issues and factor in potential repair costs.
