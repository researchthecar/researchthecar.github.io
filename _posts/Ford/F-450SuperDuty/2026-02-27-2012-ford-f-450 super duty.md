### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford F-450 Super Duty generally demonstrates strong reliability, particularly with its gasoline engine and automatic transmission. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, has a few documented issues, primarily related to the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and EGR cooler, which can be costly to repair. Electrical system components, such as the alternator, have also seen some reports of failure. However, for a heavy-duty truck, these issues are not considered widespread or indicative of a fundamentally flawed design. Regular maintenance and addressing potential diesel-specific issues proactively can ensure long-term dependability.
