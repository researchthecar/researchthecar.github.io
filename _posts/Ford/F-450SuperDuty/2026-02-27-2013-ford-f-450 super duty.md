### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Ford F-450 Super Duty demonstrates solid reliability, particularly in its core mechanical components. The gasoline engine option is generally trouble-free. The diesel engine, while powerful, can be susceptible to issues with its Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, common in many modern diesel powertrains under heavy use or specific driving cycles. Transmission reliability is good, though torque converter and fluid leak issues can arise. Electrical system components like the alternator and various sensors are the most frequently cited areas for potential failure. Exterior and interior components are largely free of widespread technical defects. Overall, the F-450 is a dependable workhorse, with most potential issues being manageable and typical for its class.
