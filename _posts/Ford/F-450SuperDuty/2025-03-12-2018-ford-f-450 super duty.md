Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2018 Ford F-450 Super Duty, organized by category and engine/transmission options, following your specified format.

The 2018 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a heavy-duty truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 (385 hp and 430 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel (450 hp and 935 lb-ft of torque). A common point of praise is its immense power and towing capacity, while some owners find the ride quality rough, especially when unloaded, and the sheer size of the truck can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces. Both engine options are paired with the TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, difficulty starting, fuel system contamination due to pump disintegration. The CP4 pump is known to be less tolerant of fuel contamination and has a higher failure rate compared to previous pumps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CP4 pump, fuel injectors, fuel lines, fuel rails, and cleaning the entire fuel system to remove debris. Some owners opt for a CP3 conversion to replace the CP4 with the older, more reliable CP3 pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ for full system replacement, including pump, injectors, lines, and cleaning. CP3 conversion kits can range from $2,500-$4,500+ depending on the kit and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights, reduced engine power, and potential damage to the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. Common issues include DEF injector clogging, DEF pump failure, and DEF sensor malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty DEF components, such as the injector, pump, or sensors. Cleaning the DEF system and ensuring proper DEF fluid quality.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,500+ depending on the specific component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, check engine light illuminated, and potential damage to catalytic converters. Issues can be more prevalent when the engine is run on E85 fuel.
    *   Solution: Replacing the spark plugs and coils if necessary. Ensure the correct spark plug gap is set for optimal performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on the number of plugs and coils needing replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration felt during acceleration or while maintaining a steady speed, particularly at lower RPMs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter or flushing the transmission fluid and using a fluid additive designed to reduce shudder. In some cases, a software update may also help.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ for fluid flush and additive; $2,000 - $4,000+ for torque converter replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh or Delayed Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, noticeable delays when shifting between gears, especially between 1st and 2nd gear.
    * Solution: Diagnose and replace faulty solenoids in the valve body; Check the transmission fluid level and condition; Consider a transmission software update.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+ depending on the complexity of the repair.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when going over bumps. This is common in heavy-duty trucks due to the leaf spring design.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring bushings with a suitable grease. Replacing the leaf spring bushings if they are worn or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for lubrication; $300 - $800+ for bushing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Trailer Wiring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Problems with trailer lights (brake lights, turn signals, running lights) not working correctly. This can be due to corrosion, loose connections, or faulty wiring harnesses.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and cleaning the trailer wiring connectors, repairing or replacing damaged wiring harnesses, and ensuring proper grounding.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the extent of the wiring damage.
