**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, excessive black smoke, unusual turbocharger noises (whining or screeching), check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. Sometimes the issue can be related to oil supply issues or foreign object damage to the turbo, so inspection of the oil supply line and intake system is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, no-start condition, rough running, check engine light.  The HPFP in these engines is known to be sensitive to fuel contamination.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP, fuel injectors, fuel rails, and potentially the fuel tank and lines to ensure all contaminated fuel is removed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, frequent regeneration cycles, check engine light.  Often caused by excessive idling or short trips that don't allow for complete regeneration.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (if possible), cleaning the DPF, or replacement of the DPF. Addressing underlying causes of excessive soot production is also crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (depending on severity and solution)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R140 TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears (e.g., 3-5), delayed engagement, transmission slipping under load.
    *   Solution: Often requires a full transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,500 - $7,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations at low speeds, especially during torque converter lockup. Can also present as poor fuel economy and overheating.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Flushing the transmission fluid and inspecting for debris is also recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle leaning to one side, reduced ride height, poor ride quality, visible cracks or damage to leaf springs. Common with heavy use and towing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End "Death Wobble"**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Violent shaking or vibration in the front end, especially at certain speeds. Often triggered by bumps or uneven road surfaces. Can be caused by worn ball joints, tie rod ends, steering stabilizers, or loose track bar.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of worn steering and suspension components. Often requires multiple parts to be replaced to fully resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the number of parts needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (EGT, MAP, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, various performance issues depending on the failed sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis and replacement of the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found
