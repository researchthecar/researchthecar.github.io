### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford F-450 Super Duty, particularly with the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel, is known for its robust performance but also presents some common mechanical and electrical challenges. Engine issues like injector O-rings, turbo problems, and head gasket failures are notable, especially on higher-mileage units. Transmission concerns, particularly with the 4R100 automatic, can arise, often related to the torque converter or solenoids. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can wear, and electrical gremlins, including alternator failures and wiring issues, are not uncommon. Rust is a significant factor for vehicles in corrosive environments. Despite these potential issues, many F-450s remain workhorses when properly maintained and repaired, with the diesel engine being a particularly sought-after powertrain.
