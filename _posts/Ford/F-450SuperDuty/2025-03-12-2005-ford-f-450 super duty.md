The 2005 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a heavy-duty truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 6.0L Power Stroke, while powerful, is known to have some reliability issues. The horsepower and torque figures for the 6.0L Power Stroke are 325 hp and 570 lb-ft of torque, respectively. Owners often praise the F-450 for its robust build and towing capacity but dislike its fuel economy and potential maintenance costs, especially concerning the 6.0L diesel engine. The transmission options were primarily the 5R110W TorqShift 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, rough running. The EGR cooler cracks and leaks coolant into the exhaust system.

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, bubbling in the coolant reservoir, excessive pressure in the cooling system. This is often a consequence of the head bolts stretching or failing due to high cylinder pressures and/or overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the head gaskets and consider installing ARP head studs to prevent future failures. Machining the cylinder heads may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, reduced power, poor fuel economy. Sticking or failing fuel injectors can cause these symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injectors. It is often recommended to replace all injectors at the same time.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, no start, stalling, poor performance. The HPOP provides the high-pressure oil needed to actuate the fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPOP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Lack of power, excessive black smoke, whistling or grinding noises. Can be due to a clogged unison ring or a failing turbocharger.

    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Consider replacing the transmission fluid and filter at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Flare/Harsh Shifts**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Delayed or erratic shifts, harsh engagement of gears. Can be caused by worn valve body components or issues with the internal clutches.
