Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2020 Ford F-450 Super Duty, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2020 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its impressive towing and payload capabilities. The F-450 offers substantial power for demanding tasks. Engine options include the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel, which generates 475 horsepower and 1,050 lb-ft of torque, and the 7.3L "Godzilla" gasoline V8, producing 430 horsepower and 475 lb-ft of torque. The F-450's robust construction and advanced technology are often praised, but some owners have reported issues ranging from minor inconveniences to more significant mechanical problems. Common complaints include concerns about the reliability of certain components, particularly in the diesel engine, and the overall cost of maintenance and repairs. Conversely, owners appreciate the truck's towing prowess, comfortable cabin (especially in higher trim levels), and available technology features.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 fuel pump is known to fail catastrophically, sending metal debris throughout the fuel system. Symptoms include rough running, lack of power, difficulty starting, and eventually complete engine failure. The pump is prone to failure due to its design, which struggles with American diesel fuel's lower lubricity compared to European standards.
    *   Solution: Replacing the entire fuel system, including the fuel pump, fuel injectors, fuel rails, and fuel lines. Some owners opt for a CP3 conversion, replacing the CP4 with the older, more reliable CP3 pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ (fuel system replacement); $3,000 - $5,000+ (CP3 conversion)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive DPF regeneration cycles, DPF clogging, and related sensors malfunctioning. Can cause reduced engine performance, poor fuel economy, and warning lights. Often triggered by excessive idling or short trips where the DPF doesn't reach optimal temperatures for regeneration.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration, DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement. Addressing underlying issues causing excessive soot production (e.g., faulty injectors).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (forced regeneration/cleaning); $2,000 - $4,000+ (DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, poor performance, black smoke from exhaust, check engine light. The EGR valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits, preventing it from functioning correctly.
    *   Solution: EGR valve cleaning or replacement. EGR cooler replacement may also be necessary if it's also clogged or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1,200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**10R140 10-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears. Delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse. Can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM). In some cases, valve body replacement may be necessary. Check fluid levels and condition.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (recalibration); $800 - $2,000+ (valve body replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPMs rise without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed. Can occur during acceleration or when climbing hills.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause of slipping (e.g., worn clutches, low fluid level, valve body issues). Repair or replacement of the affected components, potentially including a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $7,000+ (depending on severity and required repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Shaking/Vibration at Highway Speeds (especially when towing)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable shaking or vibration felt in the steering wheel or throughout the vehicle, typically at highway speeds. Often exacerbated when towing a trailer. Can be caused by unbalanced tires, worn suspension components, or issues with the trailer's suspension or hitch.
    *   Solution: Tire balancing, inspection and replacement of worn suspension components (e.g., shocks, ball joints, tie rod ends), and ensuring proper trailer loading and hitch setup.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the cause and extent of repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **SYNC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, navigation errors.
    *   Solution: Software updates, system resets, or in some cases, replacement of the SYNC module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., TPMS, ABS, parking sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard, inaccurate readings, or system failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty sensor, followed by sensor replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400 per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters failing to warm up, or only warming up partially. Can be caused by broken heating elements or faulty wiring.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the cause of the failure, followed by repair or replacement of the heating element or wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ per seat
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a capable workhorse but can experience some notable issues. The most significant concern is the potential for CP4 fuel pump failure in the 6.7L diesel, which can lead to very expensive repairs. Other issues, like DPF problems, transmission concerns, and electrical glitches, are less severe but can still be costly to address. Potential buyers of used models, especially those with the diesel engine, should thoroughly inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems.
