The 2011 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel (rated at 400 hp and 800 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.2L Boss SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 (rated at 385 hp and 405 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6R140 TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the F-450 for its robust build, strong diesel engine, and impressive towing capacity. Some common complaints revolve around the truck's size (making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces), fuel economy (especially with the diesel engine), and the overall cost of maintenance and repairs.
