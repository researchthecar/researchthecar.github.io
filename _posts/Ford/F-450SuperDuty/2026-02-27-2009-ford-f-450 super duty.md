### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford F-450 Super Duty generally offers good reliability for its class, especially regarding its core powertrain components when properly maintained. The 6.4L Power Stroke diesel engine, while powerful, is the most prone to specific issues like EGR cooler and turbocharger problems, which can be costly to repair. The gasoline V8 engines have known issues with spark plug blowouts and camshaft phasers. Transmission reliability is typically solid, though torque converter and solenoid issues can arise. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and leaf springs, may require attention due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical system issues like alternator failure are not uncommon for a vehicle of this age. Overall, the F-450 is a capable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine-related concerns and budget for potential repairs, especially on higher-mileage examples.
