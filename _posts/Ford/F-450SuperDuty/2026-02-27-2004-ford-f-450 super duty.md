### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford F-450 Super Duty, particularly with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel, is known for potential engine-related issues such as EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head gasket failures, which can be costly to repair. The gasoline engines (5.4L and 6.8L Triton) and the available transmissions (5R110W automatic and ZF6 manual) generally exhibit better reliability. Common concerns across all models include potential alternator failures and rust, especially in corrosive environments. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor can also require attention. Despite these potential issues, the F-450 remains a capable workhorse, but prospective buyers should be aware of the specific reliability concerns, particularly with the 6.0L diesel, and budget accordingly for potential repairs.
