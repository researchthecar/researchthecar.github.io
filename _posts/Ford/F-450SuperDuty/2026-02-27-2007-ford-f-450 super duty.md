### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford F-450 Super Duty, while a capable workhorse, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and heavy-duty nature. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is particularly prone to issues like EGR cooler failure, oil cooler clogging, and head gasket problems, often requiring significant investment to rectify. Other engines like the 6.8L V10 and 5.4L V8 have their own specific, though generally less severe, issues such as spark plug blowout and cam phaser problems. Transmission reliability is generally good with the 5R110W, but torque converter and solenoid issues can arise. Suspension components, especially leaf springs and ball joints, can wear out under heavy use. Electrical issues like alternator failure and wiring problems are also noted. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Interior wear, particularly on seats and HVAC components, is also common. Despite these potential issues, with proper maintenance and addressing known problems, the F-450 can remain a dependable vehicle for demanding tasks.
