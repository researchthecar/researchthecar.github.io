The 2017 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its impressive towing and payload capabilities. It was offered with two engine options: the 6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 engine, producing 385 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.7L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 engine, generating 440 horsepower and 925 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the F-450's robust build, towing prowess, and comfortable cabin. However, some common complaints include the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and the potential for high repair costs, especially concerning the diesel engine.
