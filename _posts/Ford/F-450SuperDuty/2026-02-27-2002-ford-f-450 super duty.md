### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford F-450 Super Duty, particularly with the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel, is known for its durability and capability. While common issues like injector problems, turbocharger wear, and torque converter issues can arise with age and mileage, they are often repairable. The gasoline V8 engines (5.4L and 6.8L) have their own specific concerns, notably spark plug ejection. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can experience wear due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical and interior issues are less prevalent but can include alternator failures and HVAC blower motor problems. Overall, with proper maintenance and addressing known issues, the F-450 remains a capable workhorse.
