The 2009 Ford F-450 Super Duty is a heavy-duty truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 6.4L Power Stroke diesel V8 and the 6.8L Triton V10. The 6.4L Power Stroke produces 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed TorqShift automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the F-450's power and towing capacity, but common complaints revolve around the 6.4L diesel's reliability and fuel economy.

**Engine**

**6.4L Power Stroke Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, white smoke from exhaust, overheating, possible engine damage. Coolant may also leak into the engine oil.

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford F-450 Super Duty, particularly with the 6.4L diesel, can suffer from several potentially expensive issues, primarily related to the engine and emissions systems. EGR cooler, injector, and HPOP failures can be costly to repair, as can transmission problems. While the V10 has fewer major issues, spark plug problems are common. Suspension and electrical issues are also possible. The overall cost of ownership can be high due to the potential for these significant repairs. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect any used F-450, especially the 6.4L diesel, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic familiar with these trucks.
