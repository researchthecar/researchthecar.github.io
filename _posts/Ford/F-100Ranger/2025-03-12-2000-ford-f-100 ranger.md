The 2000 Ford Ranger is a compact pickup truck known for its reliability, affordability, and ease of maintenance. It offers a practical solution for light-duty hauling and everyday driving. Engine options include a 2.5L inline-4 (approximately 119 hp and 146 lb-ft of torque), a 3.0L Vulcan V6 (approximately 150 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque), and a 4.0L Cologne V6 (approximately 160 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque, later increased to around 207 hp and 238 lb-ft). Transmission choices are typically a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Ranger's compact size, making it easy to maneuver and park. Common dislikes include the relatively small interior space and fuel economy, which isn't always stellar, particularly with the V6 engines.
