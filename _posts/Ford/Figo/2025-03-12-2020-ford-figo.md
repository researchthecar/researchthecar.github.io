Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints reported by owners of the 2020 Ford Figo, organized by category and engine/transmission option. Please note that data on the Ford Figo can be somewhat limited compared to vehicles sold in larger markets like the US, so I've compiled information from owner forums, repair databases, and reliability reports where available.

The 2020 Ford Figo is a subcompact hatchback that offers a practical and affordable option for city driving. It was available with a 1.2L Ti-VCT petrol engine producing around 87 horsepower and 85 lb-ft of torque and was typically paired with a 5-speed manual transmission. Some owners appreciate its fuel efficiency and nimble handling. Common complaints often revolve around the somewhat basic interior, limited rear passenger space, and occasionally, the availability of parts and service depending on the region.

**Engine**

**1.2L Ti-VCT Petrol Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience occasional misfires, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and the check engine light illuminating. This could be due to faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause of the misfire is crucial. Replacing faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or injectors can resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the component needing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported coolant leaks from the water pump or radiator hoses. This can lead to overheating and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Inspect the cooling system for leaks. Replace the faulty water pump or hoses and refill with coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting into Gear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have noted difficulty shifting into certain gears, particularly first or second. This can be due to worn synchros, a misaligned shifter linkage, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Inspect the shifter linkage and adjust if necessary. If the issue persists, the transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced, especially if synchros are worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150 (shifter linkage adjustment) / $500 - $1500+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Clutch Slippage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage, where the engine revs without a corresponding increase in speed, indicates a worn clutch disc.
    *   Solution: Replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throwout bearing is usually required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported premature wear of the suspension bushings, leading to clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect the suspension bushings and replace worn ones.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per bushing or set of bushings.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have experienced issues with the battery draining quickly, especially if the car is left unused for a few days. This could be due to a parasitic drain from a faulty component or wiring.
    *   Solution: Test the battery and charging system. Identify and repair any parasitic drains.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ (depending on the source of the drain)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Infotainment System Freezing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system may occasionally freeze or become unresponsive.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. If the issue persists, a software update or component replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) / $100 - $500+ (component replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Interior**

*   **Rattling Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported rattling noises coming from the dashboard or door panels, especially on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Locate the source of the rattle and secure the loose components. This may involve adding padding or tightening screws.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $100+ (depending on the complexity and if a professional is needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford Figo, while generally reliable, can experience some common issues. Engine misfires and coolant leaks in the 1.2L engine can be concerning but are often relatively straightforward to address. Transmission issues, particularly difficulty shifting, can be more costly to repair. Suspension bushing wear is another fairly common issue. Electrical gremlins like battery drain and infotainment glitches can also arise. While no major widespread recalls were found, these issues can range from minor inconveniences to potentially more costly repairs, making it essential for prospective buyers to have a pre-purchase inspection performed.
