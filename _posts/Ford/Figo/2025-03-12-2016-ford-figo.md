Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2016 Ford Figo, categorized by component and configuration, adhering to your specified format.

The 2016 Ford Figo, aimed at the budget-conscious buyer, offered a blend of practicality and fuel efficiency. Engine options varied by market, but commonly included a 1.2L Ti-VCT petrol engine (producing around 87 horsepower and 82 lb-ft of torque) and a 1.5L TDCi diesel engine (producing around 99 horsepower and 158 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were typically a 5-speed manual for both engines and, in some markets, a 6-speed automatic paired with the petrol engine. Owners often praised the Figo for its compact size, ease of parking, and fuel economy. Common complaints revolved around perceived lack of power (especially with the 1.2L petrol), basic interior trim, and sometimes, concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

**1.2L Ti-VCT Petrol Engine**

*   **Engine Mount Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive engine vibration felt in the cabin, especially at idle. Noises coming from the engine bay, particularly when accelerating or decelerating. Visual inspection may reveal cracked or collapsed engine mounts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected engine mount(s). It's often recommended to replace all engine mounts at the same time to ensure even load distribution and prevent premature failure of the new mount(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400 (depending on the number of mounts replaced and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, stalling, especially when the engine is cold. Difficulty starting the engine. Check engine light may illuminate with codes related to the IAC valve.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $250
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L TDCi Diesel Engine**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, warning lights related to the DPF, and a strong burning smell during DPF regeneration cycles. If left untreated, the DPF can become completely clogged, requiring expensive replacement.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (if the filter is not too clogged), professional DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (forced regeneration) - $1500+ (DPF replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced engine power, black smoke from the exhaust, check engine light illuminated with EGR-related codes.
    *   Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Difficulty Shifting / Grinding Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty engaging gears, especially 1st and 2nd. Grinding noises when shifting gears.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the clutch cable (if applicable). If the problem persists, inspect the clutch disc, pressure plate, and throw-out bearing for wear or damage, and replace as necessary. In some cases, the synchronizers within the transmission may be worn, requiring a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (clutch cable adjustment) - $1200+ (clutch replacement or transmission repair).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (1.2L Petrol - Some Markets)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, transmission slipping (engine revs up without corresponding acceleration), difficulty shifting into certain gears.
    *   Solution: Fluid change and inspection. If this does not fix the issue, further diagnostics would be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for Fluid Change.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Poor handling and stability, especially at higher speeds. Uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500 (depending on the number of bushings replaced and labor costs).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The car's battery frequently drains, particularly if the car is left unused for a few days. Difficulty starting the engine.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories (e.g., alarms, stereos), faulty relays, or a failing alternator. Repair or replace the faulty component.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (simple fix) - $500+ (complex electrical issue).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, or operating intermittently.
    *   Solution: Check the window switch. Then check and replace the window motor.
