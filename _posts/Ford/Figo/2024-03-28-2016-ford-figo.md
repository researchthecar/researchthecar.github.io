**Introduction:**

The 2016 Ford Figo is a subcompact hatchback available with two engine options: a 1.2-liter gasoline engine and a 1.5-liter diesel engine. The 1.2-liter engine produces 88 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque, while the 1.5-liter diesel engine produces 100 horsepower and 170 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 5-speed manual for both engines, and a 6-speed PowerShift automatic for the 1.2-liter engine.

Owners generally praise the Figo for its fuel efficiency, affordability, and compact size. However, it has received some criticism for its lack of features and power, especially in the base trim levels.
