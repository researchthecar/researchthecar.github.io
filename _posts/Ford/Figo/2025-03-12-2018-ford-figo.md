**Engine**

**1.2L Ti-VCT Petrol Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may experience misfires, leading to rough idling, reduced power, and potentially triggering the check engine light. This is frequently attributed to faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils and/or spark plugs is the recommended solution. A diagnostic scan to identify the specific cylinder(s) affected is crucial.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Engine Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported unusual noises emanating from the engine, often described as ticking or knocking sounds, which can be a precursor to more serious engine problems.  This can often be caused by low engine oil.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the noise is essential.  Checking oil levels and topping off if needed. A mechanic can perform diagnostic test to identify the specific location and problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the cause of the noise
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L TDCi Diesel Engine**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, black smoke from the exhaust, and a whistling noise from the engine bay are common symptoms of a failing turbocharger.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger is typically required. A thorough inspection of the oil feed lines and intercooler is also recommended to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Rough idling, poor fuel economy, and difficulty starting the engine can occur due to faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the injectors is required. Be sure to properly program the injector codes into the car's computer.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual Transmission**

*   **Difficulty Shifting Gears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported difficulty shifting gears, particularly into first or reverse. This can be due to worn clutch components or issues with the shift linkage.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and potentially replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, or throw-out bearing may be necessary. Adjusting or replacing the shift linkage can also resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Clunking or rattling noises from the suspension, especially when driving over bumps, can indicate worn suspension bushings (e.g., control arm bushings, sway bar bushings).
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn bushings is the common fix. In some cases, replacing the entire control arm assembly may be more cost-effective.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per bushing/control arm
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The car battery may drain prematurely, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle. This can be caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty electrical component.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing and isolating the source of the parasitic draw is essential. This may involve testing various circuits and components (e.g., aftermarket accessories, faulty relays, etc.)
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the source
    *   Recalls: None Found
