### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford Figo, particularly with the 1.5L TDCi diesel engine, shows some susceptibility to injector and turbocharger issues, which can be costly to repair. The PowerShift automatic transmission has also been noted for potential shuddering and jerking problems. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are not uncommon.
