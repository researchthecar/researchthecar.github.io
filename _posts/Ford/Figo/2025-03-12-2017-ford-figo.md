The 2017 Ford Figo, also known as the Ford Ka+ in some markets, is a subcompact hatchback designed for affordability and practicality. Engine options available include a 1.2L Ti-VCT petrol engine producing around 84 horsepower and 84 lb-ft of torque, and a 1.5L TDCi diesel engine outputting approximately 99 horsepower and 158 lb-ft of torque. The 1.2L engine is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, while the 1.5L diesel may also come with a 5-speed manual. Owners often appreciate the Figo for its fuel efficiency, compact size making it easy to maneuver in city traffic, and relatively spacious interior for its class. Common dislikes include the basic interior trim and limited features compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**1.2L Ti-VCT Petrol Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires/Rough Idling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idling, and a noticeable decrease in fuel economy. The check engine light may illuminate with codes related to cylinder misfires.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause, which could be faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, or fuel injectors. Replacement of the defective components is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the failed part and whether it can be replaced yourself or by a shop
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes.
    *   Solution: A thorough inspection for leaks is necessary, along with a compression test to evaluate the condition of the piston rings and valve seals. Depending on the cause, the fix can range from replacing valve seals to a full engine rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $2000+ (Low end is for simple gasket fixes. High end is for major engine work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**1.5L TDCi Diesel Engine**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, a warning light on the dashboard, and a decrease in engine performance. May happen due to short trips where the DPF cannot regenerate properly.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration by a mechanic, or replacement of the DPF if it is severely clogged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ depending on the severity and need to replace
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. Can also cause the engine to stall.
    *   Solution: Injector cleaning or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ for replacement depending on the number of injectors that need replacing
