Common dislikes include the relatively basic interior and somewhat limited rear passenger space.

**Engine**

**1.2L Ti-VCT Petrol Engine**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, check engine light illuminated. Often caused by faulty spark plugs or ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty spark plugs and/or ignition coils. Diagnosing the engine and looking at live data from the sensors could help pinpoint the culprit, and confirm the repair.

*   **Erratic Idle Speed**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine RPM surges up and down unpredictably while at idle. Can sometimes stall the engine. Could be caused by a dirty throttle body or a vacuum leak.
    *   Solution: Clean the throttle body and check for vacuum leaks by visually inspecting hoses. Spray carb cleaner around all of the intake hoses and connections and listen for an engine change in RPM. Replace damaged hoses as needed.
