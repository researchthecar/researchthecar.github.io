The 2003 Ford Thunderbird, a revival of the iconic nameplate, is a two-seat convertible/hardtop roadster powered by a 3.9-liter DOHC V8 engine producing 280 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Thunderbird for its retro styling, comfortable ride, and open-air driving experience. However, common complaints include electrical issues, some reliability concerns, and the relatively limited practicality of a two-seat vehicle.
