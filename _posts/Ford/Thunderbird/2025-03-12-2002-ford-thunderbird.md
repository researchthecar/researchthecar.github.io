The 2002 Ford Thunderbird marked the revival of a classic nameplate, offering a retro-styled roadster with modern amenities. It was only offered with one engine option: a 3.9L V8 engine producing 252 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. It was also only offered with one transmission: a 5R55N 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Thunderbird's distinctive styling and comfortable ride. Criticisms typically revolve around its limited practicality (small trunk space), some reliability concerns, and higher maintenance costs associated with a niche vehicle.

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford Thunderbird, while stylish, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues like coil pack failure and gasket leaks can lead to performance problems. Transmission issues, particularly valve body problems, can be costly to repair. Electrical issues with the instrument cluster and power windows are also relatively common. The convertible top mechanism can also be a source of expensive repairs. Overall, while some of these issues are relatively minor, others can be significant and costly to address, especially considering the age of the vehicle. Prospective buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic to identify any potential problems before committing to a purchase.
