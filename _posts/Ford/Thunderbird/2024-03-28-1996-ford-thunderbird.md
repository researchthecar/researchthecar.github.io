**The 1996 Ford Thunderbird: A Retro Revival with Mixed Reviews**

Introduced to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the iconic Thunderbird, the 1996 model boasted a retro design that harked back to the classic 1950s and 1960s cars. Underneath its stylish exterior, it was built on the Lincoln Mark VIII platform, offering a comfortable and powerful driving experience. Engine options included a 4.6-liter V8 with 205 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, while transmission options consisted of a 4-speed automatic (4R70W) or a 5-speed manual transmission (MT5).
