### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford Thunderbird is a stylish cruiser with a generally decent reliability record, particularly for its powertrain components when properly maintained. The most common concerns tend to revolve around the 3.9L V8 engine's camshaft synchronizers and potential oil leaks, as well as the 5R55N automatic transmission's solenoid pack and torque converter.
