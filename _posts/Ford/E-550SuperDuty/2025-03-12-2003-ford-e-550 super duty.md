The 2003 Ford E-550 Super Duty is a heavy-duty van primarily used for commercial purposes, often as a shuttle bus, ambulance, or other specialized vehicle. Engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 5.4L V8 produced around 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. The 6.8L V10 delivered roughly 310 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque. The 7.3L Diesel was available in various outputs depending on the year and application, but typically produced around 275 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. Owners generally appreciate the E-550's robust build and ability to haul significant weight. Common complaints include its size, which makes it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and fuel economy, which is poor, especially with the larger engines. Reliability can vary depending on how well the vehicle was maintained.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can strip the threads in the aluminum cylinder head upon removal or even during operation. This is a common issue on early Triton engines, including the 5.4L. Symptoms include a ticking or popping sound, especially under acceleration, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: Installing thread repair inserts (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) into the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on how many plugs need repair and if performed by a shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The intake manifold can develop cracks or leaks, leading to vacuum leaks. This can cause rough idling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exhaust manifold bolts are prone to breaking, especially on the rear cylinders. This causes exhaust leaks, which result in a ticking sound (especially when cold) and can affect engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken bolts and potentially the manifold if warped.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the number of broken bolts and accessibility)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Repair**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, the V10 engine is also susceptible to spark plug thread issues in the aluminum cylinder heads.
    *   Solution: Installing thread repair inserts (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) into the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on how many plugs need repair and if performed by a shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **Cam Position Sensor (CPS) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sudden stalling, rough running, or failure to start. The engine may crank but not fire.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Cam Position Sensor (CPS).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Driver Module (IDM) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The IDM controls the injectors, and failure can cause misfires, rough running, or a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Replacing the Injector Driver Module (IDM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 Automatic Transmission (Common to all engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, or complete loss of power transfer.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly. Can also cause erratic shift patterns.
    *   Solution: Rebuilding or replacing the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, poor ride quality, and potential instability, especially when loaded.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ per side (depending on the leaf spring pack and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, battery warning light, and eventual failure to start.
    *   Solution: Replacing the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window moving slowly or not at all.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially around wheel wells and body seams)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust, bubbling paint, and potential structural weakening.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, body panel replacement, and repainting.

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford E-550 Super Duty, while a robust and capable vehicle, suffers from several common issues, many of which are age-related. Engine problems, particularly spark plug thread repair on the Triton engines and CPS/IDM failure on the Power Stroke diesel, are relatively common. Transmission issues, such as torque converter and valve body problems, can be costly to repair. Suspension issues, like sagging leaf springs, affect ride quality and safety. Electrical problems and rust are also concerns. The severity of these issues varies based on the vehicle's history and maintenance, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor repair costs into their purchasing decision. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission work or extensive rust repair, can be quite costly.
