### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Ford F-350 is a capable heavy-duty truck with a generally solid reliability record. The gasoline 6.2L V8 is less prone to major issues than the diesel, though coolant leaks and camshaft phaser problems can occur. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, is more susceptible to issues like DPF clogging, EGR cooler leaks, and fuel injector problems, which can be costly to repair. Transmission reliability is generally good, with torque converter shudder and fluid leaks being the most common complaints. Suspension components, particularly leaf springs, can wear under heavy use. Electrical issues like alternator failure are not uncommon for a vehicle of this age and type. Overall, the F-350 is a workhorse, but owners should be aware of potential diesel-specific maintenance and repair needs.
