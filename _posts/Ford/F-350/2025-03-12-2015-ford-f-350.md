The 2015 Ford F-350 is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and towing prowess. The truck was offered with three engine options: a 6.2L gasoline V8 producing 385 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque, a 6.7L Power Stroke diesel V8 generating 440 horsepower and 860 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.8L Triton V10 producing 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission option was the TorqShift 6-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the F-350 for its immense power, payload capacity, and comfortable cabin, especially in higher trim levels. Common dislikes include the firm ride, fuel economy (especially with the diesel engine), and the cost of repairs and maintenance associated with a heavy-duty truck.
