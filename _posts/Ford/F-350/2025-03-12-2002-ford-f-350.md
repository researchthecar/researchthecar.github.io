**Summary**

The 2002 Ford F-350, while a robust and capable truck, is subject to age-related issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 7.3L Power Stroke, often revolve around fuel delivery and sensor failures. The Triton engines can suffer from spark plug issues and exhaust leaks. Transmission problems vary depending on the model, with torque converter and valve body issues being common in the automatics, and clutch/synchro wear being issues with the manuals. Suspension components wear out over time, requiring replacement of springs, ball joints, and tie rod ends. Electrical glitches can arise from the GEM, alternator, or window motors. Exterior rust is a significant concern, and interior components like dashboards and headliners can deteriorate. The severity and cost of these issues can range from minor repairs to major overhauls, so a thorough inspection is recommended before purchasing a 2002 F-350.
