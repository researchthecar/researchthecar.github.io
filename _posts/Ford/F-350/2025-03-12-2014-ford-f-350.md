The 2014 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. Engine options include the 6.2L 2-Valve SOHC EFI V8 gasoline engine (385 hp and 405 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel (400 hp and 800 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were mated to the 6R140 TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the F-350's power and ruggedness, but some common complaints include ride harshness, fuel economy, and the cost of maintenance and repairs, as well as potential reliability issues on earlier models.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, unusual turbocharger noise (whining or screeching), and potentially a check engine light. Can sometimes lead to catastrophic engine failure if debris enters the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Inspect and clean or replace the oil supply lines to the turbocharger. Address any underlying issues causing premature turbo failure (such as oil contamination or excessive idling).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting or no start, rough running, check engine light, and potential fuel system contamination with metal shavings. Catastrophic HPFP failure can require replacement of the entire fuel system.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPFP. If the HPFP has already failed catastrophically, the entire fuel system, including injectors, fuel rails, and fuel lines, may need to be replaced. Thoroughly flush the fuel tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $10,000+ (depending on the extent of damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, reduced power, DEF fluid level warning light, and potential crystallization of DEF fluid in the system. Faulty DEF sensors, heaters, or pumps are common culprits.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific DEF system component that is failing (sensor, heater, pump, injector). Replace the faulty component. Clean or replace the DEF injector if it is clogged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L 2-Valve SOHC EFI V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**6R140 TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during light acceleration, especially at lower speeds. Can also cause rough shifting and a feeling of hesitation.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. Ensure the transmission fluid is the correct type and in good condition.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, delayed engagement of gears, slipping, and a general lack of responsiveness. This can also lead to transmission failure.
    * Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body. In some cases, a software update can resolve minor issues. A complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800-$4,000
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, especially when loaded. Reduced ride height and potential for bottoming out.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for heavy hauling or towing.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front End Alignment Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Uneven tire wear, pulling to one side while driving, and a crooked steering wheel.
    *   Solution: Perform a front-end alignment. Inspect and replace any worn suspension components (ball joints, tie rod ends, etc.) that are contributing to the alignment issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on needed parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, warning lights on the dashboard, a dead battery, and eventual stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator. Check the battery and charging system wiring for any damage or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as malfunctioning power windows, door locks, lights, or other accessories. Can also cause false warning lights.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the BCM. Reprogram the BCM. Replace the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The tailgate handle breaks or becomes difficult to operate.
    *   Solution: Replace the tailgate handle. Lubricate the tailgate latching mechanism.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary:**

The 2014 Ford F-350, while a capable and popular truck, does have some common issues. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, in particular, can suffer from costly turbocharger, HPFP, and DEF system problems. Transmission issues, such as torque converter problems, can also occur. Suspension and electrical issues are less common but can still present challenges. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major repairs, with costs potentially reaching several thousand dollars depending on the problem.
