### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ford F-350 generally demonstrates solid reliability, particularly for its heavy-duty capabilities. The gasoline 6.2L V8 is relatively robust, though coolant leaks and camshaft phaser issues can arise. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, is more prone to specific issues like DPF and EGR cooler problems, which are common in modern diesel engines and can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, primarily with the 6R140, are not widespread but can include torque converter shudder and solenoid pack failures. Suspension components like leaf springs can experience wear or breakage under heavy use. Electrical components like the alternator are typical wear items. Overall, the F-350 is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of potential diesel-specific maintenance and repair needs.
