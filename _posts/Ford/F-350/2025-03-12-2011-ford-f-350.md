The 2011 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its impressive towing and payload capabilities. Engine options included a 6.2L 2-valve SOHC EFI V8 gasoline engine producing 385 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 turbo diesel engine that initially produced 390 horsepower and 735 lb-ft of torque, which was later recalibrated to 400 horsepower and 800 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6R140 TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the F-350's robust build, powerful engine options, and overall utility. However, some common complaints include issues with the diesel engine's fuel system and emissions components, as well as general wear and tear associated with heavy-duty truck usage.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

* **Turbo Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, and a whistling noise from the turbocharger. Can be caused by oil starvation, foreign object damage, or component failure.
    * Solution: Replacement of the turbocharger. Diagnosis of the underlying cause of the failure (e.g., oil leaks, air filter issues) is also crucial to prevent recurrence.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,500 - $4,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, misfires, decreased fuel economy, and white or black smoke from the exhaust. Can lead to cylinder damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). Recommended to replace all injectors at once to ensure balanced fuel delivery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor rates)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Glow Plug Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, excessive white smoke upon start-up.
    * Solution: Replacement of faulty glow plugs. It's recommended to replace all glow plugs at the same time.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Cooler Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, engine overheating. Internal leaks in the EGR cooler can lead to coolant entering the engine cylinders.
    * Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.2L 2-Valve SOHC EFI V8 Gasoline**

* **Spark Plug Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idle, loss of power, decreased fuel economy. The 6.2L can be prone to spark plug issues as it ages.
    * Solution: Replacement of spark plugs and ignition coils if necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on coil replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R140 TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

* **Shifting Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, failure to shift into certain gears. This can be caused by valve body issues, solenoid failures, or internal wear.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the specific cause of the shifting problems. Repair options range from valve body replacement to a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (for minor repairs) to $5,000+ (for a full rebuild or replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds, stalling when coming to a stop.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Sagging/Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load-carrying capacity, rough ride. Common with heavy use.
    * Solution: Replacement of leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for heavy hauling.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Ball Joints**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front end, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ per side
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Instrument Cluster Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gauges not working properly, flickering lights, error messages. This can be caused by a faulty instrument cluster or wiring issues.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,200+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Four-Wheel Drive (4WD) Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Failure to engage or disengage 4WD, grinding noises, warning lights. This can be caused by a faulty transfer case motor, wiring issues, or a damaged transfer case.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the specific cause of the 4WD problems. Repair options range from replacing the transfer case motor to rebuilding or replacing the transfer case.

**Summary**

The 2011 Ford F-350, while a capable work truck, can experience a range of issues. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine is susceptible to turbo, fuel injector, EGR cooler and glow plug related failures which can be quite expensive to repair. The 6R140 transmission can also develop shifting issues. Suspension components can wear due to the heavy demands of the F-350. Electrical issues with the instrument cluster and 4WD system can also occur. Rust is also a common issue on the F-350. Careful inspection and maintenance are crucial for these trucks.
