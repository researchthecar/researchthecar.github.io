### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford F-350, particularly models equipped with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, is known to have several significant reliability concerns. These include issues with the EGR cooler, oil cooler, head gaskets, and FICM, which can lead to substantial repair costs. Gasoline V8 engines (5.4L and 6.8L) are more prone to spark plug blowout and camshaft synchronizer failures. Transmission reliability is generally fair, with the 4R100 and 5R110W automatics potentially experiencing torque converter or solenoid issues. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear over time, especially under heavy use. Electrical issues such as alternator and instrument cluster failures are also reported. While the F-350 is a capable work truck, potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential maintenance and repair expenses.
