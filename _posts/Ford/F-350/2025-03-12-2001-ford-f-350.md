The 2001 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse nature. This model year offered a variety of engine options, including the 5.4L Triton V8 (260 hp, 350 lb-ft torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp, 425 lb-ft torque), and the highly regarded 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp, 525 lb-ft torque). Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic (4R100). Owners often appreciate the F-350's towing capacity and overall durability, but common complaints revolve around age-related wear and tear, fuel economy (especially with the V10 and diesel), and the cost of maintaining a heavy-duty vehicle.
