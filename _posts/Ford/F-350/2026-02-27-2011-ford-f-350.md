The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, while powerful, has a few documented issues, primarily related to emissions control systems like the DPF and EGR cooler, which can be costly to repair. Electrical components, such as the alternator and various sensors, have also seen some reports of failure. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread critical issues. Owners of the diesel variant should be particularly mindful of potential emissions system maintenance and costs. Overall, the F-350 is a capable truck, but potential buyers, especially of the diesel model, should factor in possible repairs related to its complex emissions systems.
