### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford F-350 is a capable heavy-duty truck, but owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the gasoline Triton V8 engines (spark plug blowout, intake manifold leaks) and the 4R100 automatic transmission (TCC issues, overheating). The robust 7.3L Power Stroke diesel is generally more reliable but can face injector O-ring or turbocharger problems. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints may require attention due to age and load. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are also noted. While rust can be a concern on older models, the core mechanicals, especially the diesel powertrain and manual transmission, are often durable with proper maintenance. Addressing these common issues proactively can ensure the longevity of the F-350.
