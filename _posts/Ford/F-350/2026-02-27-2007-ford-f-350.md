### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford F-350 is a capable heavy-duty truck, but like many vehicles of its era, it has specific areas that may require attention. The gasoline engines (5.4L and 6.8L) are prone to spark plug blowout and camshaft sensor issues. The diesel engines, particularly the 6.0L Power Stroke, are known for more significant and costly problems such as EGR cooler failure, oil cooler issues, and head gasket/stud problems. The 6.4L Power Stroke can face DPF and turbocharger concerns. Transmission reliability is generally good, with the automatic having more reported issues than the manual. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear out, especially under heavy use. Electrical issues such as instrument cluster and alternator failures are not uncommon. Interior wear and tear, particularly on seats, and exterior rust are also points to consider. Overall, while the F-350 is built tough, potential buyers should be aware of the specific engine and common failure points, especially with the diesel variants, and budget for potential repairs.
