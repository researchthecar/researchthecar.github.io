The 2016 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and payload capabilities. Engine options include the 6.2L gasoline V8, producing 385 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.7L Power Stroke turbodiesel V8, generating 440 horsepower and 860 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the F-350 for its ruggedness, workhorse capabilities, and spacious cabin, especially in higher trim levels. Some common complaints revolve around ride quality (characteristic of heavy-duty trucks), fuel economy (especially with the diesel), and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Summary**

The 2016 Ford F-350, while a capable truck, experiences a range of potential issues. The diesel engine, in particular, can be prone to expensive failures related to the fuel system (CP4 pump) and turbocharger. Electrical glitches and rust formation are also concerns. While some issues are relatively minor, others can lead to substantial repair bills. Prospective buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle's history, pay close attention to any unusual noises or symptoms during a test drive, and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic, especially one familiar with Ford Super Duty trucks.
