**Introduction:**

The 1991 Ford F-350 is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its ruggedness, powerful engines, and towing capabilities. It came with a range of engine and transmission options, including:

* 7.3L V8 Diesel (215 hp, 420 lb-ft)
* 4.9L Inline-6 (145 hp, 270 lb-ft)
* 5.0L V8 (185 hp, 310 lb-ft)

With its combination of power and practicality, the F-350 is a popular choice among truck enthusiasts and commercial users. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of common issues.

**Engine**

**7.3L V8 Diesel**

* **Injector failure:** Fuel injectors can fail prematurely, resulting in reduced engine performance, black smoke, and poor fuel economy. Replacement injectors typically cost $200-$400 each.
* **High-pressure oil pump failure:** The high-pressure oil pump can fail, causing loss of oil pressure and catastrophic engine damage. Replacement of the pump and related components can cost $2,000-$4,000+.

**4.9L Inline-6**

* **Cylinder head cracking:** The cylinder heads can crack under heavy loads, causing coolant leaks and engine overheating. Repairs require replacement of the cylinder heads, which can cost $1,500-$2,500+.

**5.0L V8**

* **Intake manifold gasket failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing vacuum leaks and engine performance issues. Replacement of the gasket typically costs $200-$400.

**Transmission**

**E4OD Automatic Transmission**

* **Input shaft bearing failure:** The input shaft bearing can wear out prematurely, causing noise, vibration, and eventual transmission failure. Replacement of the transmission typically costs $2,000-$3,000+.
* **Overdrive planetary gear failure:** The overdrive planetary gears can fail, resulting in loss of overdrive gear and difficulty shifting. Transmission replacement is typically required, costing $2,000-$3,000+.

**ZF S6-650 Manual Transmission**

* **Clutch failure:** The clutch can wear out prematurely, especially under heavy use. Replacement of the clutch kit typically costs $600-$1,000.
* **Synchronizer issues:** The synchronizers can wear out, causing difficulty shifting gears. Replacement of synchronizers and related components can cost $500-$1,000+.

**Suspension**

* **Leaf spring failure:** The leaf springs can break under heavy loads or age. Replacement of the leaf springs typically costs $600-$1,200 per axle.
* **Shock absorber failure:** The shock absorbers can wear out over time, affecting ride quality and handling. Replacement of shock absorbers typically costs $200-$400 per pair.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator failure:** The alternator can fail, causing loss of electrical power and battery failure. Replacement of the alternator typically costs $400-$600.
* **Battery failure:** The battery can fail prematurely, especially in extreme hot or cold weather. Replacement of the battery typically costs $100-$200.

**Exterior**

* **Rust:** The body panels and frame can rust over time, especially in wet climates. Repairs can range from minor cosmetic fixes to extensive bodywork.
* **Tailgate hinge failure:** The tailgate hinges can fail, causing the tailgate to sag or not open properly. Replacement of the hinges typically costs $200-$400.

**Interior**

* **Power window failure:** The power window motors or switches can fail, causing windows to become inoperable. Replacement of a power window motor typically costs $200-$400.
* **HVAC system failure:** The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system can fail, causing discomfort and reduced visibility due to fogged windows. Repairs can range from $500-$2,000+ depending on the extent of the issue.

**Summary:**

Overall, the 1991 Ford F-350 has a mix of minor and potentially severe issues. Some issues, such as injector failure on the 7.3L diesel, can be costly to repair. However, many of the issues are common to older vehicles and can be addressed with routine maintenance and repairs. By being aware of these potential issues, owners can better prepare for and address them, ensuring the longevity and reliability of their F-350.
