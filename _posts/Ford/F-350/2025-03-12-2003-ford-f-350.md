**Summary**

The 2003 Ford F-350 is a capable truck but suffers from age-related issues. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel is particularly problematic with EGR cooler and head gasket failures being common and expensive to repair. The 7.3L Power Stroke is generally considered more reliable, although issues like fuel injector problems can still occur. Gas engines can have issues with spark plugs breaking. Suspension components such as leaf springs and ball joints tend to wear out over time. Electrical issues such as instrument cluster and alternator failures can occur. Rust can be a significant concern, especially in areas with harsh winters. Repair costs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor fixes to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission repairs.
