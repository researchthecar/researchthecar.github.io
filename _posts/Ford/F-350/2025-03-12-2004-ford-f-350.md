**Summary**

The 2004 Ford F-350, particularly models equipped with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, can suffer from a range of issues, some of which can be costly to repair. The diesel engine's issues, such as EGR cooler failure, fuel injector problems, and HPOP failure, can lead to significant expenses. The 5.4L V8 and 6.8L V10 can have issues with spark plugs and exhaust manifolds, respectively. Suspension issues like worn ball joints and leaf springs are common due to the truck's heavy-duty nature. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and instrument cluster problems can also occur. Overall, potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the truck and be prepared for potential maintenance costs, especially with diesel-equipped models.
