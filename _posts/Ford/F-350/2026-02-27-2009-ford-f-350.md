### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford F-350 is a capable heavy-duty truck, but like many vehicles of its age and class, it is not without potential issues. The gasoline engines (5.4L and 6.8L V8s) are prone to camshaft phaser and spark plug blowout problems, while the 6.4L Power Stroke diesel can experience EGR cooler, turbocharger, and injector failures. Transmission reliability is generally good for the automatic, though torque converter and solenoid issues can arise. Manual transmissions are typically robust. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints may require attention due to heavy use. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and window regulators are also reported. Exterior rust and interior wear, particularly on seats and HVAC components, are common for a truck of this age. Regular maintenance and addressing these known issues proactively are key to maintaining the F-350's long-term reliability.
