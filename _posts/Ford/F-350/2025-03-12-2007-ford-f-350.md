The 2007 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. Available configurations include Regular Cab, SuperCab (extended cab), and Crew Cab. Engine options include the 5.4L Triton V8 (300 hp, 365 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (362 hp, 457 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (325 hp, 570 lb-ft of torque). The 5.4L and 6.8L were typically paired with a 5-speed TorqShift automatic transmission, while the 6.0L diesel came with either a 5-speed TorqShift automatic or a 6-speed manual transmission. Owners generally appreciate the F-350's towing power and durability, however the 6.0L diesel engine is notorious for several issues. People commonly dislike the ride quality of the vehicle as well as the reliability of certain components.

**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler failure leading to coolant entering the engine, causing white smoke from the exhaust, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the EGR cooler. Consider an aftermarket EGR cooler designed for improved durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on shop rates and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, and reduced power. Can also cause fuel dilution in the oil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $2000+ depending on the number of injectors needing replacement and if any other components were damaged as a result.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, no starting, stalling, and reduced engine power.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPOP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on the shop and if any other related components need replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, and bubbling in the coolant reservoir. This is a common issue due to the head bolts stretching.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the head gaskets and head bolts with upgraded ARP head studs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ due to the labor involved.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Breakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2007 5.4L Triton V8 engine is known for its two-piece spark plug design. These plugs are prone to breaking off in the cylinder head during removal, which makes replacing them difficult.
    *   Solution: Using special tools to extract the broken spark plugs. Use of nickel anti-seize on the new plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1000+ depending on the number of plugs broken and the shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or hissing sound, especially upon cold start, decreasing as the engine warms up. May also notice decreased fuel economy or exhaust smell in the cabin. The exhaust manifold studs are prone to breaking, causing leaks.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold studs and gaskets. In some cases, the exhaust manifold itself may need to be replaced if it is warped or cracked.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the extent of the damage and shop rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic (paired with 5.4L, 6.8L and 6.0L Diesel)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibrations during acceleration, slipping between gears, and/or a complete loss of transmission engagement.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter. Thorough inspection of the transmission for any damage caused by the torque converter failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, and/or slipping between gears.
    *   Solution: Replacement or rebuild of the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Broken Leaves**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear leaf springs are prone to sagging over time, especially with heavy use. This can lead to a reduced ride height, poor handling, and reduced load capacity. Broken leaves can cause clunking noises and instability.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs for improved performance and durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle, depending on the quality of the springs and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive play in the front suspension, clunking noises, and/or uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of gauges, warning lights, and/or the odometer.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Control Module (Diesel)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford F-350 Super Duty has several potential issues. The most serious and costly are generally related to the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, particularly EGR cooler failure, head gasket failure, and injector issues. Suspension and electrical problems are also common and can lead to significant repair costs. While the 5.4L V8 and 6.8L V10 are generally more reliable, they can still have issues like spark plug breakage and exhaust manifold leaks. Overall, a pre-purchase inspection is highly recommended, especially on diesel models, to assess the condition and potential repair needs.
