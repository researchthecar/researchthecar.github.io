**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke Diesel**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Whining noise from the turbocharger, loss of power, excessive black smoke, and potentially a check engine light. Can be caused by oil starvation, debris entering the turbo, or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Thoroughly inspect the oil supply lines and air intake system for any blockages or debris that may have caused the failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, misfires, white or black smoke from the exhaust, decreased fuel economy, and potentially engine knocking. Can be caused by contaminated fuel, electrical issues, or general wear and tear.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific faulty injector(s) and replace them. It's often recommended to replace injectors in sets, particularly if multiple injectors are showing signs of wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+ per injector (parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, decreased fuel economy, black smoke, check engine light, and potential engine stalling. The EGR valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits, leading to malfunction.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the EGR valve. In some cases, the EGR cooler may also need to be inspected and cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Clogging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, frequent regeneration cycles, check engine light, and eventually limp mode. Short trips and infrequent highway driving can contribute to DPF clogging.
    *   Solution: Attempt to force a regeneration cycle. If unsuccessful, the DPF may need to be professionally cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 for cleaning; $1,500 - $3,000+ for replacement
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L V8 Gasoline**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idle, reduced power, poor fuel economy, and a check engine light. Spark plugs can wear out or become fouled, leading to these issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the spark plugs. Consider replacing the spark plug wires or coil packs if they are also worn or damaged.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6R140 6-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping between gears, difficulty shifting, and potentially a complete loss of power.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's often recommended to also inspect the transmission for any damage and replace the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, particularly between certain gears. This can be caused by worn valve body components, low transmission fluid, or software issues.
    *   Solution: Check and adjust the transmission fluid level. If the problem persists, have the transmission diagnosed by a qualified technician. It may require valve body repair or replacement, or a software update.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 for fluid check and top-off; $500 - $1,500+ for valve body work
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, poor ride quality, reduced load-carrying capacity, and potential cracking of the leaf springs. This is more common in trucks that are frequently used for heavy hauling or towing.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty leaf springs if the truck is consistently used for heavy loads.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster, flickering displays, inaccurate readings, and potentially warning lights illuminating without cause.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. In some cases, a software update may resolve the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window moves slowly or not at all, clicking sound from the door, or complete failure of the power window.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Salty Climates)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on body panels, frame, and undercarriage. This is more prevalent in areas where salt is used on roads during winter.
    *   Solution: Address rust as soon as it's detected. Sanding, rust converters, and repainting can help prevent further damage. In severe cases, body panel replacement or frame repair may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000s depending on severity and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Driver Information Center (DIC) Screen Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The small screen in the instrument cluster fades, becomes difficult to read, or completely fails.
    *   Solution: Replace the instrument cluster or the DIC screen (if possible).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2012 Ford F-350 is a capable truck, but owners may encounter a range of issues. The most significant concerns often revolve around the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, including turbocharger failure, fuel injector problems, and DPF clogging, which can result in costly repairs. The 6.2L V8 had fewer common issues. Transmission issues with the 6R140 can also be a concern, along with suspension and electrical problems. Rust can be a significant issue in certain climates. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect any used F-350 before purchasing, particularly diesel models. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major expenses, with repair costs potentially reaching thousands of dollars.
