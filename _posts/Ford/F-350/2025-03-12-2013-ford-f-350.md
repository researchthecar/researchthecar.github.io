The 2013 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse reputation. Engine options include the 6.2L V8 gasoline engine (385 hp and 405 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 turbo-diesel (400 hp and 800 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally praise the F-350 for its towing and hauling capacity, strong engine performance, and comfortable interior. However, some common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the diesel engine, as well as the truck's large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.

**Summary**

The 2013 Ford F-350 can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The most significant concerns revolve around the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, particularly turbocharger, EGR, and fuel injector issues, which can be costly to repair. The 6-speed transmission can also experience problems. Suspension and electrical gremlins also add to the ownership experience. Overall, carefully inspecting the vehicle's maintenance history and performing a thorough pre-purchase inspection are crucial to avoid expensive repairs down the road. The severity of the issues ranges from minor sensor failures to major engine or transmission overhauls, with repair costs varying accordingly from a couple hundred dollars to upwards of several thousand.
