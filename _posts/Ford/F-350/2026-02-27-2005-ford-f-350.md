### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford F-350 is a capable heavy-duty truck, but its reliability is heavily influenced by the chosen powertrain. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is notorious for several significant and costly issues, including EGR cooler failure, oil cooler clogging, and head gasket problems, often requiring substantial investment to maintain. The gasoline V8 and V10 engines are generally more straightforward but can suffer from spark plug blowout and camshaft sensor issues. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 5R110W paired with the diesel, can develop torque converter shudder or solenoid issues. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints are subject to wear, as are common electrical items like alternators. Rust can be a concern depending on climate. Owners should prioritize thorough pre-purchase inspections, especially for diesel models, and budget for potential repairs related to the known weak points.
