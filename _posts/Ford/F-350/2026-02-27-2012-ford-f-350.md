### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford F-350 is generally a reliable heavy-duty truck, particularly the gasoline engine variant. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, while powerful, has a higher propensity for issues related to its Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, which can lead to significant repair costs. The 6R140 transmission and standard suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are typically robust and do not present widespread reliability concerns. Owners of the diesel model should be mindful of potential DPF and EGR maintenance and repair needs. Overall, the F-350 is a capable vehicle, but the diesel powertrain requires more diligent attention to its emissions control systems.
