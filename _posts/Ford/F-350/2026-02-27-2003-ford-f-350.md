### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford F-350, particularly models equipped with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, is known to have several significant reliability concerns that can lead to costly repairs. Issues like EGR cooler failure, oil cooler failure, and head gasket problems are prevalent and require substantial investment to address. The gasoline engines, while generally more straightforward, are not immune to issues like spark plug ejection. Transmission reliability is generally good for the 4R100, but overheating can be an issue, while the manual ZF6 requires attention to clutch and flywheel wear. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, as are common electrical components like alternators. Rust can also be a concern on older models. Owners should be prepared for potential maintenance and repair costs, especially with the diesel variants.
