The 2009 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 6.4L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 5.4L produced around 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. The 6.8L V10 produces around 362 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. The 6.4L Diesel produces around 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. The available transmissions were primarily a 5-speed TorqShift automatic for the gasoline engines and a 5R110 TorqShift automatic for the diesel. Owners often praise the F-350 for its ruggedness and capability, while common complaints include fuel economy, especially with the diesel engine, and some reliability issues, particularly with the 6.4L diesel.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs breaking or stripping the threads in the cylinder head during removal. This is due to the spark plugs being a two-piece design and becoming seized in the head. Can cause misfires, rough running, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Special tools are used to extract broken spark plugs. In some cases, the cylinder head needs to be removed and repaired or replaced. Using anti-seize compound on new spark plugs can help prevent this issue in the future.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the severity of the damage and the need for head removal.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.4L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler cracks or leaks, leading to coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, and potentially overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an updated design. Consider deleting the EGR system entirely (check local laws).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: DPF clogging can lead to reduced engine power, poor fuel economy, and frequent regeneration cycles. Can cause the vehicle to go into limp mode.

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford F-350, especially with the 6.4L Power Stroke Diesel, can present owners with some potentially costly issues. The diesel engine problems, such as EGR cooler, DPF, HPOP, and injector failures, can be significant. Transmission issues, particularly with the diesel models, are also a concern. While the gasoline engines have fewer major issues, the spark plug problem with the 5.4L can be expensive to repair. Suspension and electrical problems are also common. Addressing these issues can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, making it crucial to inspect any used F-350 carefully before purchase and to maintain it diligently.
