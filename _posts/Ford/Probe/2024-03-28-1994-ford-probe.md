**1994 Ford Probe**

The 1994 Ford Probe is a sporty coupe that offers a thrilling driving experience. It comes with a variety of engine and transmission options, including a 2.0L I4, 2.5L V6, and 3.0L V6, paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The Probe is appreciated for its stylish design, agile handling, and reliable performance. However, there are some common issues that owners should be aware of.

**Engine**

**2.0L I4**
- **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** This is a common issue with older Probe models. The intake manifold gasket can develop a leak, which causes a loss of coolant and a rough idle. The gasket can be replaced for around $100 - $200.
- **Head Gasket Failure:** In more severe cases, the head gasket can fail, which can lead to engine overheating, loss of power, and eventually engine failure. Head gasket replacement can cost $1,000 - $2,000+.
- **Recalls:** NHTSA Campaign Number: 97V104000 - Intake Manifold Air Seal Flange Separation

**2.5L V6**
- **No Major Issues Found:** This engine is generally considered to be reliable and does not have any significant known issues.

**3.0L V6**
- **Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Failure:** The IMRC system is responsible for switching the length of the intake manifold runners to improve engine performance. It can fail, causing a loss of power and fuel efficiency. The IMRC system replacement can cost around $500 - $1,000.
- **EGR Valve Failure:** The EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) valve can fail, which can lead to increased emissions and a rough idle. The EGR valve replacement can cost around $200 - $400.

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Manual**
- **Transmission Noise:** Some owners have reported a grinding or whining noise coming from the transmission. The noise is usually more noticeable during shifting. The transmission may need to be rebuilt or replaced, which can cost $1,500 - $3,000+.

**4-Speed Automatic**
- **Transmission Slippage:** The transmission may experience slippage, which can cause the car to hesitate or lose power during acceleration. A transmission repair or rebuild can cost around $1,000 - $2,500+.

**Suspension**

**No Major Issues Found:** The Probe's suspension is generally considered to be durable and reliable.

**Electrical**

- **Electrical System Malfunctions:** Some owners have reported issues with the electrical system, such as flickering lights or dead batteries. The problem is often caused by a faulty alternator, battery, or wiring, which can be repaired or replaced for around $200 - $500+.
- **Recalls:** NHTSA Campaign Number: 94V046000 - Headlight Switch Connector

**Exterior**

- **Rear Window Seal Leak:** The seal between the rear window and the body can fail, causing water to leak into the trunk. The seal can be replaced for around $100 - $200.

**Interior**

- **Seat Adjustment Issues:** The seat adjustment mechanisms can fail, making it difficult or impossible to adjust the seats. The seat mechanisms can be repaired or replaced for around $200 - $500+.
- **HVAC Control Unit Failure:** The HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) control unit can fail, causing the climate control system to malfunction. The control unit can be replaced for around $300 - $500+.

**Overall Summary**

While the 1994 Ford Probe is a reliable and fun-to-drive vehicle, it has some common issues that owners should be aware of. The engine and transmission issues can be serious and expensive to repair, while the other issues are generally less severe and less costly.
