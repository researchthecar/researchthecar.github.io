**Introduction:**

The 1997 Ford Probe is a sporty coupe that was available with a range of engine and transmission options. Engine choices included a 2.0L inline-4 and a 2.5L V6, while transmission options included a 5-speed manual, a 4-speed automatic, and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). The Probe was praised for its sleek design, responsive handling, and affordable price. However, it was also criticized for its cramped interior, lack of low-end torque from the 2.0L engine, and poor fuel economy, particularly with the V6 engine.
