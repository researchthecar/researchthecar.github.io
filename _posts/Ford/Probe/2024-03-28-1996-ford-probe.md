**Introduction:**

The 1996 Ford Probe is a compact sports coupe that offered a choice of two engines: a 140-horsepower 2.0L inline-four and a 164-horsepower 2.5L V6. Both engines were paired with a standard five-speed manual transmission, with an optional four-speed automatic transmission available for the V6. Despite its performance-oriented design, the Probe was also praised for its affordability and practicality. However, it faced criticism for its unimpressive handling and lack of interior refinement.

**Summary:**

While the 1996 Ford Probe offered a sporty and affordable package, it was plagued by a number of reliability issues that could be costly to repair. Common engine problems included intake and exhaust manifold failures, while transmission issues ranged from gear synchronization failures to torque converter and solenoid malfunctions. Suspension components such as struts and shocks were also prone to premature failure. In addition, electrical issues like alternator failure and starter solenoid problems could further add to the repair bills. Overall, the Probe's reliability issues could significantly reduce its perceived value and make it a less desirable choice for those seeking a reliable sports coupe.
