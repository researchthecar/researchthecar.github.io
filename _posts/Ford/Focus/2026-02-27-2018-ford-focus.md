### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Ford Focus presents a mixed reliability profile. The naturally aspirated 2.0L Duratec engine and manual transmission generally perform well with few reported issues. However, the EcoBoost engines, particularly the 1.0L and 1.5L variants, have seen some reports of cooling system leaks and turbocharger problems. The most significant concerns lie with the PowerShift dual-clutch automatic transmission, which has a history of shuddering and clutch failures, leading to substantial repair costs. The standard automatic transmission can also experience shifting issues. Electrical gremlins, primarily related to the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Buyers should exercise caution and thoroughly inspect any 2018 Focus, paying close attention to the specific engine and transmission fitted, and ideally seek out models with the manual or standard automatic transmission over the PowerShift.
