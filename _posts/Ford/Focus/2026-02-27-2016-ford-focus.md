### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford Focus presents a mixed reliability profile. While the manual transmissions and standard chassis components are generally robust, the automatic DPS6 transmission has been a significant source of concern, with widespread reports of shuddering and premature failure, often requiring costly repairs. The 1.0L EcoBoost engine, while fuel-efficient, has also seen some issues related to its cooling system and timing belt. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. Owners with manual transmissions and the 2.0L Duratec engine are likely to have a more trouble-free experience. Prospective buyers should be particularly cautious about the automatic transmission and consider a thorough pre-purchase inspection.
