**Summary**

The 2007 Ford Focus can be a reliable and economical vehicle but is prone to certain issues. The most significant problems often involve the automatic transmission, which can experience torque converter and valve body failures. Electrical issues, particularly with the instrument cluster and wiring harnesses, are also common. Engine issues are less frequent but can occur with the PCV, EGR valve, and camshaft position sensors. Suspension components like strut mounts and shocks can also wear out and require replacement. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, transmission work can be costly. Overall, potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed and be prepared for potential maintenance costs, especially if considering a vehicle with an automatic transmission.
