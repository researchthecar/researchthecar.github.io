The 2016 Ford Focus is a compact car known for its nimble handling and relatively spacious interior for its class. Engine options include a 1.0L EcoBoost I3 (123 hp, 125 lb-ft), a 2.0L Ti-VCT I4 (160 hp, 146 lb-ft), and in the ST trim, a 2.0L EcoBoost I4 (252 hp, 270 lb-ft). Transmission choices include a 5-speed manual, a 6-speed manual, and a 6-speed automatic transmission known as the DPS6 PowerShift dual-clutch automatic. Some owners appreciate the Focus for its fuel efficiency and sporty driving dynamics, while common complaints revolve around the reliability of the PowerShift transmission, particularly in models equipped with the 2.0L engine.
