Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2012 Ford Focus, categorized by component, engine/transmission option, and including estimated repair costs and recall information.

The 2012 Ford Focus represented a significant redesign for the model, aiming for a more modern and fuel-efficient compact car. It was generally praised for its European-inspired handling, stylish interior, and available features. However, it also suffered from well-documented issues, particularly with its automatic transmission. The base engine for the 2012 Focus was a 2.0L naturally aspirated inline-4 engine producing approximately 160 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic (DCT), often referred to as the "Powershift" transmission. A common dislike for this model year was the unreliability and poor performance of the dual-clutch transmission, which negatively impacted the driving experience for many owners.
