### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Ford Focus presents a mixed reliability profile. The manual transmission variants are generally robust. However, the automatic PowerShift (DPS6) transmission is a significant concern, with numerous reports of shuddering, rough shifting, and outright failure, often requiring costly repairs. Engine issues, particularly coolant and oil leaks, can occur across both naturally aspirated and turbocharged variants. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty door locks and infotainment system problems, are also noted. While the exterior and interior components are typically durable, potential buyers should be particularly wary of the transmission and factor in potential repair costs for the automatic models.
