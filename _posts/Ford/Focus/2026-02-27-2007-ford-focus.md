### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford Focus is a generally dependable vehicle, particularly with its gasoline engines. Common issues tend to be related to specific components like the intake manifold actuator on the 2.0L HE engine, cooling fan motors, and suspension bushings. Automatic transmission models, especially the 4F27E, may experience wear leading to harsh shifting or torque converter problems over time. Diesel variants, while less common in some markets, can face turbocharger and EGR issues. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and instrument clusters are also noted. Despite these points, with regular maintenance and attention to these known weak spots, the 2007 Focus can remain a cost-effective and reliable daily driver.
