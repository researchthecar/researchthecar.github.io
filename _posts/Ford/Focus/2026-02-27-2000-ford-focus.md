### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Ford Focus is a generally dependable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of specific common issues. The 2.0L Zetec engine is more prone to serious problems like cracked cylinder heads and timing belt failures than the SPI. Automatic transmissions can experience slipping and torque converter issues. Suspension components, particularly bushings, are common wear items. Electrical gremlins like instrument cluster and window regulator failures are also reported. Exterior rust, especially on wheel arches, and interior issues like HVAC blower motor and door lock actuator failures are also points to consider. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can mitigate many of these potential problems.
