**Summary**

The 2002 Ford Focus, while offering good handling and fuel economy, suffers from several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The most serious issues relate to the automatic transmission, which can experience premature failure. Spark plug blowouts in the SOHC engine and electrical failures, particularly with the instrument cluster, are also significant concerns. Suspension and interior issues, while less severe, can also contribute to overall ownership costs. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like PCV hose replacement to more substantial expenses like transmission replacement. Be sure to carefully inspect a prospective purchase for these issues and factor potential repair costs into the overall budget.
