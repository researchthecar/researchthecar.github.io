**Introduction:**

The 2010 Ford Focus is a compact car available with various engine and transmission options. The 2.0L 4-cylinder engine is standard, producing 140 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. A 2.0L GDI engine producing 160 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque is optional, paired with a 5-speed manual or 6-speed PowerShift automatic transmission.
