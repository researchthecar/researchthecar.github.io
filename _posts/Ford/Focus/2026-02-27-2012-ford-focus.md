### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford Focus presents a mixed reliability profile. The naturally aspirated 2.0L Duratec engine is generally robust, though coolant and oil leaks can occur. The 2.0L EcoBoost, while offering better performance, is more susceptible to turbocharger issues and coolant leaks. The most significant concern for this model year is the DPS6 PowerShift automatic transmission, which has been widely reported to suffer from shuddering, rough shifting, and premature failure, often requiring costly repairs. Manual transmissions are typically more reliable but can experience clutch wear. Suspension components like struts and bushings are subject to normal wear and tear but can lead to issues if neglected. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are also possible. Exterior and interior components are generally durable, with no widespread critical issues reported.
