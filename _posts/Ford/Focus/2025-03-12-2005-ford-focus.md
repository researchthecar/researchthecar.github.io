**Engine**

**2.0L Duratec DOHC I4**

*   **Hesitation/Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may hesitate during acceleration or stall completely, especially at idle or when coming to a stop. This can be intermittent.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the throttle body is a common first step. If that doesn't resolve the issue, inspect and possibly replace the idle air control (IAC) valve. Additionally, check for vacuum leaks and address any found.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Check Engine Light - Evaporative Emission System (EVAP) Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The check engine light illuminates, and a diagnostic scan reveals codes related to the EVAP system (e.g., P0440, P0455). You might also smell fuel vapors.
    *   Solution: Check and replace the gas cap. Inspect the EVAP system hoses and canister for cracks or leaks. The purge valve and vent valve can also fail.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $250+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.3L Duratec DOHC I4**

*   **No Specific Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4F27E)**

*   **Erratic Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The transmission may exhibit hard or delayed shifts, slip between gears, or fail to shift at all.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change may help in some cases. More severe issues may require a valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement. Check the transmission fluid level, and check for leaks from the cooler lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps or turning. Premature tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the front strut mounts. Consider replacing the struts and shocks at the same time if they are worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per side, depending on labor rates and parts used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues (Specifically the early production vehicles)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster may experience intermittent failures, flickering lights, or complete loss of function. Speedometer and tachometer readings may be inaccurate.
    *   Solution: Sometimes, reflowing the solder joints on the circuit board can fix the issue. Otherwise, the cluster may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows may become slow, noisy, or stop working entirely.
    *   Solution: Replace the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handle Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exterior door handles, particularly the driver's side, can break or become difficult to operate.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door handle.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $150+ per handle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The fabric headliner detaches from the backing board and sags down, especially in warmer climates.
    *   Solution: The headliner board must be removed and reupholstered.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ depending on shop and material used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Plastic Trim Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracking of dashboard or door panel plastics, particularly on vehicles parked in direct sunlight.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the cracked trim pieces is the only permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ depending on the part and location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2005 Ford Focus, while generally reliable, has several common issues to watch out for. Engine stalling and EVAP leaks are common on the 2.0L engine, while the 4-speed automatic transmission can suffer from erratic shifting. Suspension and electrical problems are also prevalent, including strut mount failures and instrument cluster glitches. Headliner sagging and door handle failures are common interior and exterior concerns. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but addressing them promptly can prevent further damage and ensure the vehicle's longevity. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas before purchasing a used 2005 Ford Focus.
