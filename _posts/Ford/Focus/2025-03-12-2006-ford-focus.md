The 2006 Ford Focus, while praised for its affordability and handling, had some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems like valve cover gasket leaks and PCV valve failure are generally inexpensive to fix. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic transmission, can be more costly, ranging from fluid flushes to complete rebuilds. Suspension and electrical issues are also possible, but often more manageable in terms of cost. Rust, especially in areas with road salt, can be a significant concern. Overall, while the Focus can be a good value, a thorough inspection is crucial, and budgeting for potential repairs is advisable.
