### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Ford Focus presents a mixed reliability profile. While the manual transmission and standard suspension components are generally robust, the PowerShift automatic transmission has been a source of concern for some owners, particularly regarding shuddering and potential leaks. Engine-wise, the naturally aspirated 2.0L Ti-VCT can experience cooling and oil leaks, while the EcoBoost variants, especially the turbocharged ones, may face more significant issues like turbocharger problems or head gasket failures in performance models. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the infotainment system, are also noted. Prospective buyers should pay close attention to the specific engine and transmission combination, as this will heavily influence the long-term reliability and potential repair costs.
