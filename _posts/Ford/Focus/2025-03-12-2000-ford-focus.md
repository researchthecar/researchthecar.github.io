The 2000 Ford Focus was a popular compact car known for its European-inspired handling and fuel efficiency. Engine options included the 2.0L Zetec inline-4 engine, producing around 130 horsepower and 135 lb-ft of torque, and the less common 2.0L SPI (Split Port Induction) inline-4, which produced around 110 horsepower and 125 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were primarily a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praised the Focus for its nimble handling, sporty feel, and affordability. Common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly regarding engine and transmission problems, as well as electrical issues.

**Summary**

The 2000 Ford Focus, while praised for its handling and design, is prone to a variety of issues common with older vehicles. Engine problems (particularly with sensors and vacuum leaks), transmission issues (slipping and erratic shifting), and electrical faults (instrument cluster and door locks) are common areas of concern. Suspension components like coil springs and control arm bushings can also wear out. Addressing these issues can range from relatively inexpensive sensor replacements to more costly transmission overhauls, with a potential repair cost of $30 to $1500+. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to safety concerns affecting driveability.
