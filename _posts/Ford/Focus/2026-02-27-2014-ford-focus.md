### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Ford Focus presents a mixed reliability profile. The naturally aspirated 2.0L Duratec engine is generally robust, but owners should be aware of potential coolant and oil leaks. The turbocharged EcoBoost engines, while offering better performance, can be susceptible to similar leaks and, in the case of the 2.0L, turbocharger issues. The most significant concern for the 2014 Focus is the DPS6 PowerShift automatic transmission, which has a history of shuddering, rough shifting, and outright failure, often requiring costly repairs or replacement. Manual transmissions are more straightforward but can experience normal clutch wear. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can wear over time, leading to ride quality issues and steering problems. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are also reported. Exterior and interior components are generally reliable with no widespread critical issues.
