### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Ford Focus generally presents a solid reliability record for its segment, particularly with the gasoline engines. Common issues tend to be related to wear items that can be exacerbated by age and mileage, such as cooling system components and suspension bushings. Diesel models, while offering better fuel economy, can be more prone to turbocharger and fuel system issues. Transmission reliability is mixed, with manual gearboxes being fairly robust, while automatic transmissions may require attention for shifting problems or control module failures. Electrical gremlins like window regulators and instrument cluster issues are not uncommon for vehicles of this age. Overall, the 2008 Focus is a practical choice, but potential buyers should be aware of these specific potential repair areas.
