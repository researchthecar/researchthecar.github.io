The 2011 Ford Focus marked a significant redesign for the model, aiming for improved fuel economy and a more modern driving experience. The standard engine was a 2.0L Duratec inline-4 cylinder engine producing 140 horsepower and 136 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual transmission and a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DCT), marketed as "PowerShift." Many owners appreciated the Focus's improved styling, fuel efficiency, and handling compared to earlier generations. However, the PowerShift transmission became a major source of complaints, overshadowing many of the vehicle's positive attributes. While some enjoyed the responsive steering and overall driving dynamics, the transmission issues led to widespread dissatisfaction and reliability concerns.
