Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2013 Ford Focus, organized by category and including details on symptoms, solutions, and estimated costs. The 2013 Ford Focus was available with a 2.0L Ti-VCT I-4 engine producing 160 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed PowerShift automatic. The Focus was generally praised for its fuel economy, handling, and styling, but the PowerShift transmission became a major source of owner dissatisfaction due to its jerky shifting and reliability problems.

**Engine**

**2.0L Ti-VCT I-4**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, hesitation upon acceleration, check engine light. Often caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty ignition coil(s) and/or spark plugs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Purge Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, difficulty filling the gas tank, rough idling. The purge valve is part of the evaporative emission control system (EVAP).
    *   Solution: Replace the purge valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, low oil level. Often from valve cover gasket or oil pan gasket.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed PowerShift Automatic (DPS6)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerky Acceleration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, shuddering, or jerking during acceleration and gear changes, especially at low speeds.
    *   Solution: Potential fixes vary widely. Some owners have reported improvement after a TCM (Transmission Control Module) reprogram. Clutch replacements (often under warranty at the time, but now likely out of warranty) or even full transmission replacement might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (TCM reprogram) - $4000+ (Transmission Replacement). Clutch replacement: $1500-$2500+
    *   Recalls: 17V-022 (TCM Reprogram), 18V-735 (Clutch and TCM Inspection/Replacement)

*   **Transmission Slipping/Failure to Engage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine revving without corresponding vehicle acceleration. Complete failure to move.
    *   Solution: This often indicates severe clutch wear or internal transmission damage. Complete transmission replacement is frequently the only solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4000+
    *   Recalls: 17V-022 (TCM Reprogram), 18V-735 (Clutch and TCM Inspection/Replacement)

*   **Clutch Chatter/Vibration**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive vibration and noise during clutch engagement (take-off).
    *   Solution: Clutch replacement is the usual solution, but the underlying cause (TCM calibration, clutch design) may lead to repeat failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: 17V-022 (TCM Reprogram), 18V-735 (Clutch and TCM Inspection/Replacement)

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the rear suspension, particularly when going over bumps. Can be caused by worn sway bar bushings, shocks, or struts.
    *   Solution: Replace worn bushings, shocks, or struts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, difficulty starting the car. Can be caused by a parasitic draw from various electrical components (e.g., SYNC system, door locks).
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve software updates or replacing faulty modules.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (diagnostic time can be significant)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SYNC System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, failure to connect to Bluetooth devices, unresponsive touchscreen.
    *   Solution: Attempt a system reset. If that fails, a software update or replacement of the SYNC module might be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset) - $500+ (module replacement)

**Summary**

The 2013 Ford Focus, while appealing in many aspects, has several potential issues, particularly with the PowerShift automatic transmission. Transmission problems are the most concerning due to their high repair costs and impact on drivability. Electrical issues and door latch problems are also relatively common. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchase, paying special attention to the transmission's performance. Due to the age of the vehicle, recalls for the transmission or door latches may have already been performed, or may no longer be honored by Ford. If the vehicle has the PowerShift transmission, having the transmission inspected by a mechanic prior to purchase would be a wise decision.
