The 2002 Ford E-150 Econoline is a popular full-size van known for its versatility and utility, often used for commercial purposes, family transportation, and conversion into recreational vehicles. Engine options included a 4.2L Essex V6 (around 200 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.6L Triton V8 (around 225 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.4L Triton V8 (around 235-255 horsepower and 330-350 lb-ft of torque). All engine options were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the E-150 for its spacious interior, towing capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design. Common complaints include issues related to age, such as rust, worn suspension components, and electrical gremlins.

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford E-150 Econoline, while generally reliable, exhibits issues typical of vehicles of its age. Engine problems, particularly spark plug thread issues in the 4.6L and 5.4L engines and intake manifold gasket failure in the 4.2L, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, such as harsh shifting, may require a simple fluid flush or a complete rebuild. Suspension components like ball joints, tie rod ends, and leaf springs wear out over time. Electrical gremlins, such as door ajar light problems and instrument cluster malfunctions, can be frustrating. Rust is a common issue, especially in areas with road salt. The severity and cost of these issues vary significantly depending on the vehicle's condition and maintenance history, but potential buyers should be aware of these common problems when considering a 2002 E-150.
