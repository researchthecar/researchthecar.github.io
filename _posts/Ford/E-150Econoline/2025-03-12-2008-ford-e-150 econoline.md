The 2008 Ford E-150 Econoline is a full-size van known for its spaciousness, utility, and durability. Engine options included a 4.2L Essex V6, a 4.6L Triton V8, and a 5.4L Triton V8. The 4.2L V6 produced approximately 200 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 4.6L V8 produced approximately 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque. The 5.4L V8 produced approximately 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. The E-150 was primarily favored for its cargo and passenger hauling capabilities, making it a popular choice for businesses and large families. However, some common complaints include its fuel economy, relatively dated interior, and handling compared to more modern vans. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.2L Essex V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plugs Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4.6L and 5.4L Triton engines are notorious for their spark plugs breaking during removal due to a two-piece design and buildup of carbon in the cylinder head. This results in a difficult and time-consuming extraction process.
    *   Solution: Special spark plug extraction tools are available to remove the broken plugs. Using penetrating oil and careful technique is also crucial. Some mechanics recommend replacing the original plugs with a one-piece design to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the number of broken plugs and the need for professional extraction.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plugs Breaking During Removal**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same as the 4.6L Triton V8. The 5.4L and 4.6L Triton engines are notorious for their spark plugs breaking during removal due to a two-piece design and buildup of carbon in the cylinder head. This results in a difficult and time-consuming extraction process.
    *   Solution: Special spark plug extraction tools are available to remove the broken plugs. Using penetrating oil and careful technique is also crucial. Some mechanics recommend replacing the original plugs with a one-piece design to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ depending on the number of broken plugs and the need for professional extraction.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported hard or erratic shifting, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Slipping may occur under heavy acceleration.
    *   Solution: A transmission flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. More severe cases may require valve body repair or replacement, or even a complete transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (flush and filter) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, especially when going over bumps. Poor handling and wandering steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn ball joints and bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the extent of the damage and whether control arms need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Ajar Light Stays On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "door ajar" light on the instrument cluster remains illuminated even when all doors are closed and secured. This can drain the battery and prevent the dome lights from turning off.
    *   Solution: Identify and replace the faulty door jamb switch. WD-40 and other contact cleaners may temporarily fix the problem.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $20 - $100+ per switch
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **ABS Light Stays On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: ABS light remains illuminated.
    *   Solution: Usually caused by a faulty wheel speed sensor. An OBDII scanner can be used to read trouble codes.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the location of the sensor and the repair shop's labor rate.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing along the rocker panels, wheel wells, and lower edges of the doors. This is especially prevalent in areas with harsh winters and road salt usage.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, including sanding, patching, and repainting. Prevention includes regular washing and application of rust inhibitors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the severity of the rust and the extent of the repairs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2008 Ford E-150 Econoline is a workhorse that, while reliable, has its share of potential issues. The spark plug issues on the 4.6L and 5.4L Triton engines are common and potentially expensive to address. Suspension components wear due to the van's weight. Electrical problems like door sensor malfunctions can also be a nuisance. Rust is a potential concern, particularly in colder climates. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, major repairs to the transmission or engine can be costly. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle, especially for rust and engine maintenance history, and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
