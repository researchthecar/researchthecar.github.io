Transmission issues, while not as frequent, can also be expensive. Suspension and electrical issues are fairly typical for a vehicle of this age. Rust is a concern, especially in colder climates. Overall, while many E-150s offer solid reliability, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is crucial to identify and address any potential problems. The severity of issues varies, but major repairs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
