**Introduction:**

The 2007 Ford E-150 Econoline is a full-size van available with a choice of three engine options: a 4.6L V8, a 5.4L V8, and a 6.8L V10. Transmission options include a 4-speed automatic for the 4.6L V8, a 5-speed automatic for the 5.4L V8, and a 4-speed automatic for the 6.8L V10. The E-150 offers spacious seating for up to 15 passengers and ample cargo capacity. However, it has also been subject to several common issues that owners have reported.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

* **Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Valve Failure:** The IMRC valves in the intake manifold can fail, causing performance issues and increased fuel consumption. Symptoms include rough idling, hesitation on acceleration, and decreased power. The fix involves replacing the IMRC valves, which typically costs around $300 - $500.
* **Spark Plug Blowout:** The spark plugs can sometimes blow out due to excessive cylinder pressure. This can damage the threads in the cylinder head and lead to engine damage. Replacing the spark plugs and repairing the cylinder head can cost upwards of $1,000.

**5.4L V8**

* **Cam Phaser Failure:** The cam phasers, which adjust the valve timing, can fail, leading to engine noise, decreased performance, and increased fuel consumption. Replacing the cam phasers is a costly repair, typically ranging from $1,500 - $2,500.
* **Spark Plug Wear:** The spark plugs can wear out prematurely, causing misfires and engine performance issues. Replacing the spark plugs is a relatively inexpensive repair, costing around $100 - $200.

**6.8L V10**

* **Oil Leaks:** The 6.8L V10 is prone to oil leaks from the valve covers, oil pan, and rear main seal. These leaks can cause oil loss and potentially lead to engine damage if not addressed. Fixing the leaks can be costly, depending on the location and severity of the leak.
* **Exhaust Manifold Cracking:** The exhaust manifolds can crack, leading to exhaust leaks and a loss of power. Replacing the exhaust manifolds is a labor-intensive repair that can cost upwards of $1,500.

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4.6L V8)**

* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** The shift solenoids, which control the transmission's gear shifts, can fail, causing shifting problems. Replacing the shift solenoids can cost around $300 - $500.
* **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter, which connects the engine to the transmission, can fail, leading to slippage and loss of power. Replacing the torque converter is a costly repair, typically ranging from $1,000 - $2,000.

**5-Speed Automatic (5.4L V8)**

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** The transmission can develop leaks from the transmission pan, seals, or lines. These leaks can cause fluid loss and potentially lead to transmission damage if not addressed. Fixing the leaks can cost around $200 - $500.
* **Slipping Gears:** The transmission may slip out of gear, especially during acceleration or under heavy loads. This can be caused by worn clutches or other internal components. Repairing the transmission can cost upwards of $2,500.

**Suspension**

* **Strut Assembly Failure:** The strut assemblies, which support the front suspension, can fail, causing clunking noises, a rough ride, and poor handling. Replacing the strut assemblies typically costs around $600 - $1,000 per side.
* **Ball Joint Wear:** The ball joints, which connect the suspension arms to the wheels, can wear out, leading to loose steering and poor handling. Replacing the ball joints costs around $200 - $400 per side.

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain:** The electrical system can drain the battery prematurely due to faulty components or parasitic drains. Identifying and fixing the cause of the drain can be time-consuming and costly.
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator, which charges the battery, can fail, leaving the vehicle without power. Replacing the alternator costs around $400 - $600.

**Exterior**

* **Door Lock Actuator Failure:** The door lock actuators can fail, preventing the doors from locking or unlocking properly. Replacing the door lock actuators typically costs around $200 - $300 per door.
* **Power Window Failure:** The power window motors or switches can fail, preventing the windows from operating properly. Replacing the power window components costs around $200 - $400 per window.

**Interior**

* **Climate Control System Failure:** The climate control system, including the heater, air conditioning, and ventilation, can malfunction due to faulty sensors, actuators, or other components. Repairing the climate control system can cost around $500 - $1,500, depending on the issue.
* **Dashboard Cracking:** The dashboard may crack or warp over time due to exposure to heat and sunlight. Replacing the dashboard is a costly repair, typically ranging from $1,000 - $2,000.

**Summary:**

The 2007 Ford E-150 Econoline presents several potential issues across various components, including engine, transmission, suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior problems. Some of these issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, while others can be more severe and costly to repair. It is essential for owners to be aware of these potential problems and to have regular maintenance and inspections performed to address any issues promptly and prevent further damage.
