### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Ford Econoline is a capable commercial vehicle with a generally solid reputation for durability. However, given its age, owners should be aware of potential issues, particularly with the Triton V6 and V8 engines, such as intake manifold leaks and spark plug blowout. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4R70W and E4OD/4R100, can experience torque converter or solenoid issues. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also common wear items. Electrical systems, particularly the alternator and wiring, may require attention. Rusting on body panels is a concern for vehicles in humid or road-salt-prone environments. Overall, with diligent maintenance and addressing specific known issues, the 2001 Econoline can remain a reliable work vehicle.
