### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Ford Econoline is a capable commercial vehicle with a generally solid reputation for durability, especially concerning its powertrains. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as intake manifold gasket leaks and spark plug blow-out on V8 and V10 engines, and torque converter or solenoid pack problems in the automatic transmissions. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can also require attention due to the vehicle's workload. Electrical system reliability is generally good, though alternators and wiring can be points of failure. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Interior issues are typically limited to HVAC components and instrument cluster malfunctions. Proactive maintenance and addressing these common issues can ensure the continued serviceability of the Econoline.
