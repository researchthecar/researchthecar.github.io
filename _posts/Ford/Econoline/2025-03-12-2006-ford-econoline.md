**Summary**

The 2006 Ford Econoline is a workhorse van with a reputation for reliability, but it's prone to some common issues as it ages. The spark plug thread issues with the Triton V8 engines can be expensive to repair. Rust is a significant concern, especially in areas with road salt. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are also common wear items. While individual repairs may not be drastically expensive, the accumulation of these issues can lead to considerable maintenance costs over time. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the van for rust and signs of engine or transmission problems before purchasing.
