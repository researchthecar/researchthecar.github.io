The 2002 Ford Econoline, also known as the Ford E-Series, is a full-size van renowned for its durability and cargo capacity. It was a popular choice for commercial use, conversions, and even as a family vehicle. Engine options for the 2002 model year included the 4.2L Essex V6 (200 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque), the 4.6L Triton V8 (225 hp and 290 lb-ft of torque), the 5.4L Triton V8 (235 hp and 335 lb-ft of torque) , and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options were primarily the 4R70W 4-speed automatic, with the E-350 Powerstroke variants getting the 4R100. Owners generally appreciate the Econoline's reliability, simple design, and spacious interior. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy (especially with the larger engines), handling characteristics due to its size, and age-related wear and tear issues typical of a vehicle of this vintage.

**Summary**

The 2002 Ford Econoline, while generally reliable, is prone to certain issues due to its age and high usage. Engine problems such as spark plug ejection and intake manifold leaks are common with the Triton engines, while the Power Stroke can suffer from CPS and UVCH failures. Transmission issues like hard or soft shifting can lead to costly repairs. Suspension wear and tear, particularly ball joints and leaf springs, will impact ride quality and safety. Electrical glitches and rust are other common areas of concern. Severity of the issues range from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, and repair costs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and the repair shop. Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for signs of these issues and factor in potential repair costs.
