The 2003 Ford Econoline, also known as the E-Series, is a full-size van popular for its versatility and robustness, often used for commercial purposes, passenger transport, and conversions into RVs. The 2003 model year offered a range of engine options including a 4.2L Essex V6 (200 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque), a 4.6L Triton V8 (225 hp and 286 lb-ft of torque), a 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque), and a 7.3L Powerstroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options generally included a 4-speed automatic (4R70W). Owners often appreciate the Econoline's spaciousness, payload capacity, and relatively simple mechanical design. However, common complaints include fuel economy, handling characteristics, and some recurring mechanical issues typical of older vehicles.

**Engine**

**4.2L Essex V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough idle, coolant leaks, and potential overheating. The gasket between the intake manifold and cylinder head deteriorates, leading to vacuum leaks and coolant entry into the cylinders.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gasket.

**Summary**

The 2003 Ford Econoline is a generally reliable workhorse, but it is prone to some age-related issues. Engine-related problems, particularly with spark plug threads on the Triton V8 engines and CPS failures on the 7.3L diesel, can be significant. Transmission issues can also be costly. Suspension wear and rust are common concerns. Repair costs can range from relatively inexpensive fixes like replacing sensors or headliners to more substantial expenses like engine work, transmission rebuilds, or rust repair. Careful inspection and maintenance are essential for keeping a 2003 Econoline on the road.
