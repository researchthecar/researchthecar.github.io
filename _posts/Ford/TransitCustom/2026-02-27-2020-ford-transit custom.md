### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Ford Transit Custom demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its chassis and body components. The most frequently reported technical concerns tend to revolve around the diesel engine's emissions control systems (AdBlue) and, to a lesser extent, turbocharger performance. Transmission issues are not widespread but can include typical wear on manual clutches or potential leaks in automatic units. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and occasional battery drain, are also noted. For owners, proactive maintenance of the AdBlue system and regular checks of electrical connections can help mitigate potential issues. Despite these points, the Transit Custom remains a dependable workhorse for most commercial applications.
