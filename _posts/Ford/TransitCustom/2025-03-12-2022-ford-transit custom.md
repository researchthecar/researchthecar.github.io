Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Ford Transit Custom, formatted for your website, broken down by category and engine/transmission option where applicable.

The 2022 Ford Transit Custom is a popular choice for commercial and personal use, known for its versatility and practicality. Engine options in some markets typically include a range of EcoBlue diesel engines. A common configuration is the 2.0L EcoBlue diesel, available in various power outputs (e.g., 105 PS, 130 PS, 170 PS). These engines are favored for their fuel efficiency and adequate torque for hauling and towing. People generally appreciate the Transit Custom's spacious cargo area, comfortable driving position, and maneuverability in urban environments. Some common criticisms include the ride quality (particularly when unladen), the sometimes-basic interior trim, and potential for certain electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBlue Diesel (Specific Power Output Not Specified)**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires, rough running, loss of power, check engine light illuminated. Often caused by contaminated fuel or injector wear.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injector(s). It is recommended to replace all injectors as they are typically replaced in sets. Diagnostics and injector programming are required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor rates)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine running rough, reduced power, increased emissions, check engine light. This issue is often caused by carbon build-up restricting valve movement.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR valve. In some cases, cleaning the valve may temporarily resolve the issue, but replacement is usually necessary for a long-term fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, warning light illuminated (DPF or check engine), frequent regeneration cycles, potential for complete blockage. DPF issues can stem from short trips where the filter doesn't reach optimal regeneration temperature.
    *   Solution: Forced DPF regeneration (if blockage isn't severe), DPF cleaning (if possible), or DPF replacement (if cleaning fails or the filter is damaged).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (forced regeneration) - $2000+ (DPF replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*No engine/transmission option specified*
*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abnormally harsh or jerky shift quality while upshifting or downshifting.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and replace any damaged parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2500+ (Depending on the extent of the damage and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Can be more pronounced in cold weather.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the leaf spring bushings and contact points with a suitable grease. In some cases, replacing worn bushings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (lubrication) / $200 - $500+ (bushing replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (Ford SYNC) intermittently freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a restart. This can affect navigation, audio, and other vehicle functions.
    *   Solution: Perform a system reset (if possible). Check for software updates and install them. If the problem persists, the infotainment module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software updates/reset) / $500 - $1500+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty sensor for the oil or coolant levels. Check engine lights will appear.
    *   Solution: Perform system diagnostics and replace any faulty sensors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (Depending on the number of sensors replaced and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Wiring Harness**
    *   Description/Symptoms: If the wiring is damaged due to wear and tear, poor connection, etc, it can cause faulty lights or connections. This can also cause the sensors to not properly read and give out false codes.
    *   Solution: Perform diagnostics on the wiring harness and replace any damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (Depending on the extent of the damage and labor costs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding side door, sticking, or requiring excessive force. Can be caused by misalignment, damaged rollers, or a faulty latch mechanism.
    *   Solution: Adjust the door alignment. Lubricate the rollers and latches. Replace damaged rollers or the latch mechanism if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (adjustment/lubrication) / $100 - $500+ (parts replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Rattling/Vibrating Dashboard Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying rattles or vibrations emanating from the dashboard area, especially when driving on rough roads. Often caused by loose trim pieces or poorly secured components.
    *   Solution: Identify the source of the rattle and secure loose trim pieces with appropriate fasteners or padding.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $200 (DIY fix or minor repair) / $100 - $500+ (professional repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford Transit Custom appears to be a generally reliable vehicle, but it is not without its potential issues. Engine-related problems (particularly with fuel injectors, EGR valve, and DPF) are common concerns, and can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system issues, sensor malfunctions, and harness problems, are another recurring theme. Suspension and exterior issues, such as leaf spring squeaking and sliding door problems, are less severe, but can still be irritating for owners. Overall, while the Transit Custom offers practicality and versatility, prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in the possibility of repairs when considering ownership.
