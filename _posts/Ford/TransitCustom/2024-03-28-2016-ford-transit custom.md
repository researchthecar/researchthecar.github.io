**2016 Ford Transit Custom**

The 2016 Ford Transit Custom is a popular commercial van known for its spacious interior, versatile configurations, and fuel-efficient engines. However, some owners have encountered issues with certain components. Here's a comprehensive list of common problems reported with the Transit Custom:

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBlue Diesel**

* **Intake Manifold Failure:** The intake manifold may crack, leading to decreased engine power, rough idling, and excessive exhaust smoke. The solution involves replacing the faulty intake manifold. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $2,500+
* **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve Malfunction:** The EGR valve can become faulty, causing poor engine performance, reduced fuel economy, and increased emissions. Replacing the EGR valve usually resolves the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Gear Grinding:** Some owners have reported grinding noises when shifting gears. The issue may be caused by worn synchronizers or damaged gears. The solution typically involves replacing the affected components. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Clutch Failure:** The clutch may slip or fail prematurely, causing difficulty shifting gears or loss of power transmission. Replacing the clutch assembly is necessary. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $1,000 - $2,000+

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks:** Leaks can occur from the transmission seals or gaskets. Replacing the faulty components and topping up the transmission fluid usually fixes the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+

**Suspension**

**Front Suspension**

* **Strut Bearing Failure:** The strut bearings can wear out prematurely, leading to clunking noises when turning or going over bumps. Replacing the strut bearings resolves the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $800+
* **Upper Control Arm Bushing Wear:** The upper control arm bushings can experience excessive wear, resulting in vibrations or poor handling. Replacing the worn bushings is the solution. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+

**Rear Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Failure:** The rear leaf springs may break or sag over time, affecting the vehicle's load-carrying capacity and handling. Replacing the faulty leaf springs is necessary. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,500+

**Electrical**

* **Battery Discharge:** Some owners have reported issues with the battery draining prematurely. Investigating the electrical system for parasitic drains and replacing the battery if necessary can solve this problem. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $500+
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator may fail to charge the battery adequately, leading to power loss or difficulty starting the vehicle. Replacing the alternator is the solution. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $500 - $1,000+

**Exterior**

* **Side Mirror Cracking:** The side mirrors can develop cracks, affecting visibility. Replacing the cracked mirror is the only solution. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $200 - $500+

**Interior**

* **Dashboard Rattling:** Some owners have reported rattling noises coming from the dashboard, particularly when driving on rough roads. Identifying and tightening loose components usually resolves the issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $100 - $300+
* **Climate Control Malfunction:** The climate control system may not work properly, resulting in inadequate heating or cooling. Diagnostic testing and replacing faulty components such as the HVAC module or actuators can fix this issue. **Estimated Cost to Fix:** $300 - $1,000+

**Recalls**

* NHTSA Recall Number: 18V131000 - Fuel Injection Line Misalignment
* NHTSA Recall Number: 18V181000 - Roof Structural Integrity
