Here is a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2019 Ford Transit Custom, categorized by component and engine/transmission option. The Transit Custom is a popular van known for its practicality, comfortable driving experience, and versatility for both commercial and personal use. Common praises revolve around its spacious interior and relatively car-like handling. However, some criticisms include concerns about long-term reliability and relatively high running costs. Engine options for the 2019 Transit Custom typically included a range of diesel engines. For example, the 2.0L EcoBlue diesel came in varying power outputs such as 105 PS (104 hp, 77 kW) and 360 Nm (266 lb-ft), 130 PS (128 hp, 96 kW) and 385 Nm (284 lb-ft), and 170 PS (168 hp, 125 kW) and 405 Nm (299 lb-ft). Transmission options typically included a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.0L EcoBlue Diesel**

* **Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and potentially the engine entering limp mode. This is often linked to faulty injectors causing incorrect fuel delivery.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty fuel injector(s). Recoding the new injectors to the engine control unit (ECU) is also necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector, depending on location and labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **EGR Valve Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Check engine light, rough running, poor fuel economy, and black smoke from the exhaust. The EGR valve can become clogged with carbon deposits, affecting its operation.
    * Solution: Cleaning or replacement of the EGR valve. In some cases, a software update to the ECU can help manage EGR valve operation.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ depending on whether cleaning is sufficient or replacement is needed.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Manual**

* **Clutch Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clutch slippage (engine revs increasing without a corresponding increase in speed), difficulty shifting gears, a high biting point on the clutch pedal, and potentially a burning smell.
    * Solution: Replacement of the clutch kit, including the clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing. It's often recommended to inspect and potentially replace the flywheel as well.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1500+ depending on labor and parts costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Synchro Wear**
    * Description/Symptoms: Grinding or difficulty shifting into specific gears, particularly 2nd or 3rd gear. This indicates wear on the synchro rings within the gearbox.
    * Solution: Gearbox rebuild with replacement of worn synchro rings. This is a complex repair.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor. A replacement gearbox may be more cost-effective in some cases.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic**

* **Rough Shifting**
    * Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky gear changes, particularly when shifting between lower gears.
    * Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change can sometimes improve shifting. However, if the problem persists, it may indicate a more serious issue such as valve body wear or internal component damage. In severe cases, a transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 for a fluid flush and filter change. $2000 - $5000+ for a rebuild or replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Torque Converter Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds or a noticeable delay in acceleration, particularly when climbing hills.
    * Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sitting lower than the front, especially when loaded. This indicates sagging or weakened rear leaf springs.
    * Solution: Replacement of the rear leaf springs. It's recommended to replace them in pairs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ depending on the brand of springs and labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Worn Suspension Bushings**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the suspension, particularly when driving over bumps. This often indicates worn or deteriorated suspension bushings.
    * Solution: Replacement of the worn suspension bushings. This may involve replacing control arms or other suspension components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on which bushings need replacement and the associated labor.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: The battery draining overnight or within a few days of being charged, making it difficult to start the van. This can be caused by a parasitic drain from a faulty electrical component or a failing battery.
    * Solution: Diagnosis of the parasitic drain using a multimeter. Replacement of the faulty component or the battery.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain and the cost of the replacement part. A new battery typically costs $100-$300.
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Door Lock Actuators**
    * Description/Symptoms: Doors failing to lock or unlock properly, requiring manual operation.
    * Solution: Replacement of the faulty door lock actuator(s).
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per door lock actuator, depending on labor costs.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Sliding Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty opening or closing the sliding door, sticking, or making loud noises. This can be caused by worn rollers, damaged tracks, or a misaligned door.
    * Solution: Adjustment of the door alignment, lubrication of the rollers and tracks, or replacement of worn parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the severity of the issue and the parts that need replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Infotainment System Glitches**
    * Description/Symptoms: Freezing, slow response times, or random reboots of the infotainment system.
    * Solution: Software update, resetting the system, or replacing the infotainment unit.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for a software update) to $1000+ for a replacement unit.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford Transit Custom, while generally a practical and versatile van, does have some common issues to be aware of. Engine issues, particularly with the 2.0L EcoBlue diesel, can be costly due to injector or EGR valve failures. Transmission issues, both manual and automatic, can also lead to significant repair bills. Other areas of concern include suspension components and electrical gremlins. While not all Transit Customs will experience these problems, it's wise to have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic, paying close attention to these common areas, to mitigate potential risks. The severity of these issues varies, with some being relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, while others can be major and require significant investment.
