The 2016 Ford Transit Custom is a popular cargo van known for its practicality and versatility. It's available in various configurations, including short and long wheelbases, and different roof heights. Engine options typically include a 2.2-liter Duratorq TDCi diesel engine in various power outputs (around 100-155 horsepower), as well as a 2.0-liter EcoBlue diesel introduced later in the year. These engines are usually paired with a 6-speed manual or, in some cases, an automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Transit Custom's spacious cargo area, comfortable driving position, and car-like handling. Some common complaints include issues with the diesel particulate filter (DPF), electrical glitches, and relatively high running costs depending on usage.
