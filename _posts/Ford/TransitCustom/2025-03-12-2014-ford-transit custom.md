The 2014 Ford Transit Custom is a popular mid-size panel van known for its practicality, fuel efficiency, and versatility. The 2014 model offered several engine options, including a 2.2L Duratorq TDCi diesel engine with varying power outputs (100PS/74kW, 125PS/92kW, and 155PS/114kW), a 2.0L EcoBoost petrol engine (203PS/149kW), and a 2.3L Duratec petrol engine (145PS/107kW). Transmissions typically included a 6-speed manual and, on some models, a 6-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciate the Transit Custom's spacious cargo area, comfortable ride, and maneuverability. However, common complaints often revolve around electrical issues, injector failure in some diesel models, and premature wear of certain components.

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Transit Custom, while generally reliable, has some common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine issues, particularly injector failures in the diesel models, can be costly. Electrical problems, ranging from central locking malfunctions to battery drains, are also frequent complaints. Suspension issues like sagging leaf springs can affect ride quality and load capacity. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission rebuilds or dashboard replacements, can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should have a thorough inspection performed, focusing on these potential problem areas, to make an informed decision.
