### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Ford Transit Custom demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly in its suspension, exterior, and interior components, where no significant widespread issues are reported. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) system on EcoBlue diesel engines, which can require regeneration or cleaning, and potential issues with the automatic transmission's shifting performance. Clutch wear is a common consideration for manual transmission variants, as expected with high-mileage commercial use. Electrical gremlins, mainly concerning the infotainment system, are also noted but generally manageable through software updates. With proper maintenance and attention to these specific areas, the Transit Custom should provide dependable service.
