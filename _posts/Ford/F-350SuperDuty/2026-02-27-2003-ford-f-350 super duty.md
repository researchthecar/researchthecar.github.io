### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a capable workhorse, but potential buyers and owners should be aware of specific common issues. The gasoline engines (5.4L V8 and 6.8L V10) are prone to spark plug ejection and camshaft sensor failures. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, is notorious for expensive problems like EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head gasket failures, along with injector issues. Automatic transmissions (4R100) can suffer from torque converter shudder and overheating. Manual transmissions (ZF6) typically face clutch wear. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear out. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and instrument cluster problems are also noted. Rust can be a concern on exterior body panels. Interiorly, the HVAC blower motor is a common failure point. Addressing these potential issues proactively, especially with the 6.0L diesel, is crucial for long-term reliability and cost management.
