The 2020 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and towing prowess. It comes with a range of engine options, including the 6.2L gasoline V8 (385 hp, 430 lb-ft torque), the 7.3L gasoline V8 (430 hp, 475 lb-ft torque), and the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel V8 (475 hp, 1,050 lb-ft torque). Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic (with the 6.2L) and a 10-speed automatic (with the 7.3L and 6.7L). People generally praise the F-350 for its towing capacity, powerful engine options, and comfortable interior (depending on the trim level). Common complaints include a stiff ride, especially when unloaded, and the high cost of ownership, including maintenance and fuel.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke Diesel V8**

*   **Fuel System Issues - CP4 High-Pressure Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 high-pressure fuel pump is known to be prone to failure, especially when contaminated with even small amounts of water. Failure can lead to metal shavings circulating through the fuel system, causing damage to injectors, fuel rails, and other components. Symptoms include rough running, difficulty starting, and ultimately, a complete engine failure.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CP4 pump with an updated or alternative fuel pump (such as a CP3 pump, which is considered more robust) and cleaning/replacing any contaminated fuel system components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulty starting in cold weather, rough idle, and excessive smoke upon startup. Often throws a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty glow plug(s). Sometimes, the glow plug controller also needs replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on how many need replacement and whether the controller needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: "Check Engine" light, reduced engine power, messages related to DEF system malfunction. Issues can range from faulty DEF sensors to problems with the DEF pump or injector. Crystallization of DEF in the tank and lines can also cause issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific fault in the DEF system, which may require replacing sensors, the DEF pump, the DEF injector, or cleaning/flushing the DEF system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Gasoline V8 (Godzilla)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**6.2L Gasoline V8**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R140 - Paired with 6.7L Power Stroke and 7.3L Gasoline V8)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, especially between certain gears (commonly 3-5 and 7-9).  Clunking noises can occur during shifts or when coming to a stop.  Some owners report a shuddering sensation at low speeds.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue.  If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal component wear may require replacement of the valve body or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$300 for software reflash, $800 - $2000+ for valve body replacement, $3,000 - $7,000+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Delayed Engagement/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay when shifting into drive or reverse.  The transmission may also slip during acceleration, resulting in a loss of power and RPM flare.
    *   Solution: This often indicates internal damage to the transmission, such as worn clutches or damaged solenoids.  A transmission rebuild or replacement is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $7,000+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (Paired with 6.2L Gasoline V8)**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Noticeable squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring bushings. If the bushings are worn or damaged, they will need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for lubrication, $200-$800+ for bushing replacement depending on the extent of the work.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **SYNC System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, or unresponsive touchscreen. Bluetooth connectivity problems.  Navigation system malfunctions.

*   **Trailer Camera Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the trailer camera system. Distorted or unclear image.
    *   Solution: Checking the camera connections for corrosion or damage, replacing the camera, or repairing the wiring harness.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+ depending on the issue and the price of the camera.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Issues**

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a capable truck, but owners have reported a range of issues. The most severe and costly problems are associated with the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, particularly the potential for CP4 fuel pump failure, which can lead to extensive engine damage. Transmission issues with the 10-speed automatic are also a common concern, though less severe than the diesel engine problems. Other issues, such as suspension squeaks and electrical glitches, are generally less expensive to address. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential problems and consider them when evaluating a used 2020 F-350. It is important to thoroughly inspect the truck and obtain a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic, especially for diesel models.
