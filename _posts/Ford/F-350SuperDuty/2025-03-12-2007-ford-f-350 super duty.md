    *   Solution: Inspect and repair or replace the turbocharger.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $3000+ (including labor and new turbo)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, coolant mixing with oil. A common and expensive issue on the 6.0L Power Stroke, often linked to EGR cooler failure and head bolt stretch.
    *   Solution: Replace head gaskets. Often involves machining the cylinder heads and upgrading head studs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford F-350 Super Duty, while a capable truck, has some notable reliability concerns. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is the most problematic, with issues like EGR cooler failure, head gasket failure, and injector problems leading to significant repair costs. Other issues, like spark plug problems on the 5.4L V8, worn suspension components, and electrical glitches, can also add to the ownership expenses. Rust can also be a significant issue, especially in regions with harsh winters. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be quite costly, making it crucial to thoroughly inspect any potential purchase and factor in potential maintenance costs.
