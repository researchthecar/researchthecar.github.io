### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford F-350 Super Duty demonstrates solid reliability, particularly with its gasoline engine option. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, has a few documented issues, primarily related to emissions control systems like the DPF and EGR cooler, which can incur significant repair costs. Transmission reliability is generally good, though the diesel's 6R140 automatic can occasionally exhibit torque converter shudder. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are largely free of widespread technical defects. Owners should be aware of potential diesel-specific maintenance needs and costs.
