The 2023 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its capability and towing capacity. Engine options include the 6.8L V8 gas engine (405 hp and 445 lb-ft of torque), the 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 gas engine (430 hp and 485 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 turbo-diesel engine (500 hp and 1,200 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the truck's powerful engine options, towing capacity, and updated technology, while common dislikes include the high price, large size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and potential for a rough ride, especially when unloaded.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo-Diesel**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete engine failure, metallic debris throughout the fuel system, engine won't start, loss of power. The CP4 high-pressure fuel pump, sourced from Bosch, has been known to fail due to its design being less tolerant of low-quality diesel fuel in the US market. This pump relies on fuel for lubrication, and if lubrication is insufficient, it can self-destruct, sending metal fragments throughout the fuel system.
    *   Solution: Complete fuel system replacement, including the fuel pump, injectors, fuel lines, and potentially the fuel tank.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting in cold weather, excessive white smoke upon startup, engine misfires. Faulty glow plugs or glow plug control module.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty glow plugs or glow plug control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8 Gas**

*   **Valve Train Noise (Tick)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise coming from the engine, more pronounced at idle. Can be related to oil pressure or roller rocker arms.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine root cause (oil pressure check, rocker arm inspection). Repair could involve oil pump replacement, rocker arm replacement, or more extensive valve train work.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $3,000+ depending on the cause.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Gas Engine**
* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky shifts, especially between certain gears (e.g., 3-5 or 5-7), hesitation or delays in shifting, transmission slipping.
    *   Solution: Software recalibration of the transmission control module (TCM). If that doesn't work, valve body replacement or, in severe cases, complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (recalibration) - $6,000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Ride Quality (Empty)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy or harsh ride, especially when the truck bed is empty. This is inherent to heavy-duty trucks designed to carry heavy loads.
    *   Solution: While not a "fix" in the traditional sense, solutions include adding weight to the bed, installing aftermarket suspension components (e.g., air springs, softer shocks), or simply adjusting tire pressure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3,000+ (depending on solution chosen)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Lagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: SYNC 4 system freezes, touchscreen unresponsive, slow response times, Bluetooth connectivity issues.
    *   Solution: Software updates, hard reset of the system. If the problem persists, replacement of the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1,000+ (APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: 23C33 - Certain 2023 F-Super Duty vehicles with SYNC4 software may experience a blank display screen upon vehicle start-up.

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Park Assist)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard, system not functioning properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine faulty sensor, replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Trailer Reverse Guidance Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Backup camera display shows incorrect or no view of the trailer, calibration fails or error messages are displayed, making the trailer reverse guidance system unusable.
    *   Solution: Software updates to the camera module or replacement of the camera.
