The 2015 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse nature. Available engine options include the 6.2L 2-Valve SOHC EFI Gas V8 (385 hp, 405 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.7L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (440 hp, 860 lb-ft of torque). Both engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the F-350 for its towing capacity, reliability, and overall toughness. Common complaints revolve around the rough ride when unloaded, fuel economy (especially with the diesel), and some reported issues with specific components.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke, unusual turbo noises (whining or screeching), check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the turbocharger. Sometimes, the issue stems from oil leaks causing premature turbo failure. Regular oil changes and monitoring oil levels can help prevent this.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+ depending on the shop and whether a new or remanufactured turbo is used.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Glow Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, especially in cold weather, excessive white smoke on startup, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty glow plugs and, if necessary, the glow plug control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+, depending on the number of glow plugs needing replacement and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, decreased fuel economy, excessive smoke, check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace faulty fuel injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors on a bank to ensure even fuel delivery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3,000+, depending on the number of injectors replaced and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L 2-Valve SOHC EFI Gas V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Misfiring, rough idling, decreased fuel economy.
    * Solution: Replace faulty spark plugs.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ depending on labor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

*   **6R140 6-Speed Automatic (Applies to both engine options)**
    *   **Torque Converter Shudder/Vibration**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, particularly at lower speeds and during light acceleration, or when the torque converter locks up.
        *   Solution: Transmission flush using updated fluid (some owners report success with this). If the issue persists, torque converter replacement may be necessary.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission Flush $200-$400, Torque Converter Replacement $1,000-$3,000+
        *   Recalls: None Found

    *   **Harsh Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
        *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or clunky shifts, noticeable delay when shifting into drive or reverse, slipping.
        *   Solution: Check transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is burnt or low, a flush might help. Otherwise, valve body issues or internal component wear could be the culprit, requiring a transmission rebuild or replacement.
        *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Transmission Flush $200-$400, Valve Body Repair/Replacement $500-$1500, Transmission Rebuild/Replacement $3,000-$6,000+
        *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sag/Wear (Especially in Heavy-Use Trucks)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sitting lower than the front, reduced load-carrying capacity, rougher ride.
    *   Solution: Replace worn leaf springs with new or upgraded units. Airbag assist systems can also be added to help support the load.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Leaf Spring Replacement $500-$1,500+ per side, Airbag Assist System $300-$800+ (plus installation)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, wandering on the road, uneven tire wear, clunking noises from the front suspension.
    *   Solution: Replace worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends. An alignment is crucial after replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$1000+ per side depending on components replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, slow cranking, battery warning light, eventually complete electrical failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions (ABS, TPMS, etc.)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Warning lights on the dashboard, inaccurate readings, system malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor fault using a scan tool and replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ per sensor, depending on location and type.

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Areas with Road Salt)**

**Summary**

The 2015 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a capable truck, but owners should be aware of some potential issues. Diesel engine problems such as turbocharger and fuel injector failures can be costly, while the 6-speed transmission may experience shuddering or harsh shifting. Suspension wear is typical for a heavy-duty truck, and electrical issues such as alternator failure can also occur. Rust can be a concern, especially in areas with road salt. Overall, while some issues can be expensive, regular maintenance and prompt attention to problems can help keep the F-350 running reliably.
