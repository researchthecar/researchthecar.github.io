**Introduction**

The 2012 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck available with three engine options: a 6.2L V8 (385 hp, 405 lb-ft), a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel (400 hp, 800 lb-ft), and a 6.8L Triton V10 (362 hp, 457 lb-ft). Transmission options include a 6-speed automatic, a 6-speed manual with the 6.2L V8 only, and a TorqShift 6-speed automatic with the diesel and V10 engines. The F-350 Super Duty is known for its durability, towing capacity, and off-road capabilities, but it has also been plagued by several issues.

**Engine**

**6.2L V8**

* **Fuel Injector Failure:** Injectors become clogged or fail, causing engine misfires, rough idle, and poor fuel economy. Replacing the injectors can cost between $500 - $1,000 per injector, plus labor.
* **Intake Manifold Gasket Leak:** The intake manifold gasket can develop leaks, leading to coolant or oil leaks and decreased engine performance. Repairing the leak involves replacing the gasket, which typically costs $200 - $500.
* **Turbocharger Failure (if equipped):** The turbocharger can fail due to oil starvation or other mechanical issues, resulting in reduced power and increased emissions. Replacing the turbocharger can cost between $1,500 - $3,000.

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

* **Turbocharger Malfunction:** The variable geometry turbocharger can stick or fail, leading to reduced power, increased emissions, and engine noise. Replacing the turbocharger costs around $2,000 - $4,000.
* **EGR Cooler Failure:** The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) cooler can become clogged or fail, causing the engine to overheat and experience decreased performance. Replacing the EGR cooler costs approximately $1,500 - $3,000.
* **Injector Sticking:** The fuel injectors can become stuck open or closed, leading to engine misfires, rough idle, and reduced power. Replacing the injectors typically costs between $500 - $1,000 per injector, plus labor.

**6.8L Triton V10**

* **Spark Plug Failure:** The spark plugs can develop carbon deposits or fail, causing engine misfires and reduced power. Replacing the spark plugs costs around $200 - $400.
* **Intake Valve Sticking:** Intake valves can stick open or closed, leading to decreased engine performance, rough idle, and engine knock. Repairing this issue requires replacing the valves and associated components, which costs approximately $1,000 - $2,000.
* **Timing Chain Failure:** The timing chain can stretch or break, causing catastrophic engine damage. Replacing the timing chain and related components can cost between $2,000 - $4,000.

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (all engines)**

* **Transmission Fluid Leak:** The transmission can develop a leak at the pan gasket or other seals, causing fluid loss and transmission damage. Repairing the leak typically costs between $200 - $500.
* **Torque Converter Shudder:** The torque converter can develop a shudder during gear shifts, indicating a need for transmission servicing or rebuild. The cost to rebuild a transmission can range from $2,000 - $4,000.
* **Shift Solenoid Failure:** The transmission shift solenoids can fail, causing shifting problems and erratic behavior. Replacing the solenoids costs approximately $300 - $800.

**6-Speed Manual (6.2L V8 only)**

* **Clutch Wear or Failure:** The clutch can wear out or fail due to heavy use or abuse, resulting in slipping gears and difficulty shifting. Replacing the clutch typically costs between $800 - $1,200.
* **Transmission Input Bearing Failure:** The input bearing can fail, causing noise and binding during gear shifts. Replacing the input bearing costs approximately $500 - $1,000.

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic (6.7L V8 and 6.8L V10)**

* **Transmission Slipping:** The transmission can slip gears under load, indicating worn or damaged clutch packs. Rebuilding the transmission can cost between $2,000 - $4,000.
* **Overheating:** The transmission can overheat during towing or heavy use, causing reduced performance and potential damage. Servicing the transmission and replacing the fluid can resolve this issue, costing approximately $200 - $500.
* **Valve Body Failure:** The transmission valve body can fail, leading to shifting problems and erratic behavior. Replacing the valve body costs around $1,000 - $2,000.

**Suspension**

* **Leaf Spring Breakage:** The leaf springs can break under heavy loads or repeated flexing, resulting in a sagging or uneven ride. Replacing the leaf springs typically costs between $500 - $1,000 per side.
* **Shock Absorber Failure:** The shock absorbers can fail due to wear or damage, causing a rough ride and reduced handling. Replacing the shock absorbers costs approximately $300 - $800.
* **Ball Joint Wear:** The ball joints can wear out, causing looseness in the steering and front end components. Replacing the ball joints costs between $300 - $600 per side.

**Electrical**

* **Charging System Failure:** The alternator or voltage regulator can fail, leading to a lack of battery charging and potential electrical problems. Replacing the alternator or voltage regulator costs around $500 - $1,000.
* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely due to a parasitic electrical draw, such as a faulty module or short circuit. Diagnosing and repairing the electrical issue can cost between $200 - $500.
* **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch can fail, causing the headlights or other lighting components to malfunction. Replacing the headlight switch costs approximately $200 - $400.
