The 2003 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse nature. Engine options for this year included the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the formidable 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel (early 2003) or the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel (late 2003). The 7.3L produced around 275 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the truck's towing capacity and durability, especially those equipped with the 7.3L diesel. Common complaints revolve around the reliability of certain components, particularly in later model 6.0L diesels, and the age-related issues that come with owning a 20+ year old vehicle.

**Summary:**

The 2003 Ford F-350 Super Duty, while a capable truck, suffers from several common issues that potential buyers should be aware of. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is particularly prone to expensive problems like head gasket and oil cooler failures. The 7.3L diesel, while generally more reliable, can still experience injector and sensor issues due to its age. Other common problems include suspension wear, electrical component failures, and rust. The severity and cost of these issues vary, but major engine or transmission repairs can easily exceed several thousand dollars. It is essential to thoroughly inspect any prospective purchase and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic.
