### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Ford F-350 Super Duty, particularly with the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel, is generally considered a robust and reliable truck. However, common issues like spark plug blowout on the Triton gasoline engines and injector O-ring leaks on the Power Stroke are well-documented. Transmission issues, especially with the 4R100 automatic, can arise, often related to torque converters or solenoids. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear, especially under heavy use. Electrical issues such as alternator failure are not uncommon. Rust can be a significant concern depending on the climate. Overall, while capable, owners should be aware of these potential repair areas to maintain optimal performance and longevity.
