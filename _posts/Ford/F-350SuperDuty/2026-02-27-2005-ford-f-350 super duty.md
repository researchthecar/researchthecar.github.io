### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Ford F-350 Super Duty, particularly models equipped with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, is known to have several significant potential issues. These include EGR cooler failures, oil cooler failures, and head gasket problems, which can be costly to repair. The gasoline engines (5.4L and 6.8L V8s) are more prone to spark plug blowout and camshaft position sensor issues. Transmission reliability is generally good, though torque converter and solenoid issues can arise in the automatic, and clutch/flywheel wear is expected in the manual. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear out under heavy use. Electrical issues, such as instrument cluster failures, are also reported. Despite these potential problems, the F-350 remains a capable heavy-duty truck, but owners should be aware of and prepared for possible repairs, especially with the 6.0L diesel.
