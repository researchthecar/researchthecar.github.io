### Summary Verdict
The 2020 Ford F-350 Super Duty demonstrates solid reliability, particularly with its gasoline engine options. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, while powerful, has a few documented issues related to fuel injectors and DPF regeneration, which are not uncommon for modern diesel powertrains and can incur significant repair costs if they arise. The 10-speed automatic transmission may occasionally exhibit minor shifting hesitations, often resolvable with software updates. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and trailer brake controller issues, are present but generally not critical. Overall, the F-350 is a robust truck, but potential buyers of diesel models should be aware of the associated maintenance and potential repair costs.
