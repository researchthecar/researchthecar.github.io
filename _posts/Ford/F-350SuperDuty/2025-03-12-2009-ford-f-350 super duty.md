The 2009 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and towing capacity. Available engine options include a 5.4L Triton V8, a 6.8L Triton V10, and the popular 6.4L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 6.4L Power Stroke produced 350 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consist primarily of a 5-speed TorqShift automatic. Owners appreciate the truck's workhorse capabilities and solid construction. Common dislikes include fuel economy, especially with the diesel engine, and some reports of reliability issues, particularly concerning the 6.4L diesel.

**Engine**

**6.4L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, potential for engine overheating, rough running. The EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) cooler can crack and leak coolant into the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an updated design. Some owners opt for an EGR delete kit to eliminate the issue entirely (though this may not be legal in all areas).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on whether the EGR cooler or EGR delete kit is selected, and shop labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, no starting, stalling, rough idle, loss of power. The HPOP provides the necessary oil pressure for the fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPOP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+ depending on the shop labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, white smoke from exhaust, fuel in the oil, potential for engine damage. Fuel injectors can fail due to poor fuel quality or contamination.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once if one fails, to ensure even performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$800 per injector plus labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**
* **Spark Plug Breakage During Removal**
    * Description/Symptoms: Difficulty removing spark plugs, spark plugs breaking inside the cylinder head, causing potential damage to the cylinder head.
    * Solution: Use penetrating oil, special extraction tools or removal techniques designed to mitigate the risk of breakage. Sometimes requires cylinder head removal and repair or replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$1000+, depending on the severity and if head removal is necessary.
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, slipping between gears, complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's often recommended to rebuild the transmission at the same time to address any potential wear and tear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+ depending on whether the transmission is rebuilt.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, delayed engagement, slipping, failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Rebuild or replace the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on shop labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced ride height, poor ride quality, reduced load carrying capacity. Leaf springs can sag or break, especially with heavy use or frequent towing.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavier-duty springs if the truck is frequently used for towing or hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ per axle, depending on the type of springs and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **4x4 Shift Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to shift into or out of 4-wheel drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the shift motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ including parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Gauges reading incorrectly or not at all, flickering or dimming of the display, complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster. In some cases, a faulty connection or ground can be the issue.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the repair needed and shop labor rates.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Cab Corners and Rocker Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust on the lower cab corners and rocker panels, especially in areas where salt is used on roads during the winter.
    *   Solution: Cut out the rusted sections and weld in new metal. Proper rustproofing and painting are essential to prevent future rust.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ per area, depending on the severity of the rust and the quality of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2009 Ford F-350 Super Duty, especially when equipped with the 6.4L Power Stroke diesel engine, can be prone to several issues, some of which can be costly to repair. The EGR cooler, HPOP, and fuel injector problems on the diesel engine are significant concerns. Torque converter issues are possible on the transmission, regardless of engine choice. Rust can also be a factor, depending on location. Potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic. While the truck is capable, understanding these potential issues can help buyers make informed decisions and budget accordingly.
