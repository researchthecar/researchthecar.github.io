### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Ford F-350 Super Duty, particularly with the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine, is known to have several significant potential issues that require attention. These include EGR cooler failures, oil cooler problems, and head gasket issues, which can be costly to repair. The gasoline V8 and V10 engines are more prone to spark plug blowout. Automatic transmissions, especially the 4R100, can experience torque converter and overheating problems. While the manual transmission is generally robust, suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints can wear over time. Electrical issues such as alternator failure and instrument cluster problems are also reported. Owners should be aware of these common problems and factor potential repairs into ownership costs, especially for the 6.0L diesel.
