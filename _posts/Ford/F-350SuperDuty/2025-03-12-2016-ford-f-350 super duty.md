Alright, here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2016 Ford F-350 Super Duty, formatted as requested.

The 2016 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. It offered a choice between two engine options: a 6.2L V8 gasoline engine producing 385 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 turbodiesel engine that generates 440 horsepower and 860 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the F-350's robust build, powerful engine options (especially the diesel), and towing prowess. Common complaints often revolve around ride quality (typical of heavy-duty trucks), fuel economy (especially with the diesel), and some reliability concerns that can lead to costly repairs.
