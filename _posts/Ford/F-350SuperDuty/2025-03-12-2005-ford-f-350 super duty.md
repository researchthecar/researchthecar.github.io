The 2005 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a robust truck known for its towing and hauling capabilities. It appeals to those needing a dependable workhorse. Available engine options include the 5.4L Triton V8, the 6.8L Triton V10, and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8. The 5.4L V8 produces around 300 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions available include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. While appreciated for its ruggedness and functionality, common complaints include issues related to the 6.0L diesel engine, particularly its reliability and maintenance demands, along with some electrical and suspension concerns. Owners often praise its towing capacity and durable build but dislike the fuel economy and potential repair costs associated with certain engine configurations.

**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, potential for "hydro-locking" the engine (coolant entering the cylinders).
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an upgraded or bulletproofed version. Many owners also opt to delete the EGR system entirely (check local regulations).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, oil leaks, sludge buildup in the cooling system. Often occurs in conjunction with EGR cooler failure.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler. It's generally recommended to replace the EGR cooler at the same time, as they are often related.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, black smoke from the exhaust, poor fuel economy. Sticking or failed injectors can damage the engine.
    *   Solution: Diagnose which injectors are faulty and replace them. Consider replacing all injectors at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per injector
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from the exhaust, bubbling in the coolant reservoir, "hydro-locking" the engine. Often caused by high cylinder pressures associated with the 6.0L design.
    *   Solution: Replace the head gaskets. This is a labor-intensive job. Many owners also choose to install head studs at the same time to prevent future failures.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running, difficulty starting. The 2005 model year uses spark plugs known for breaking when removed, leaving part of the plug in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Use caution and penetrating oil when removing spark plugs. If a plug breaks, special tools are required to extract the broken piece. Some owners choose to replace the original cylinder heads with updated designs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the severity and if head replacement is needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**5R110W TorqShift 5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering, slipping, especially under load. Can also cause overheating of the transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's generally recommended to rebuild or replace the transmission at the same time, as debris from the failed torque converter can damage the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or erratic shifting, slipping between gears, failure to shift.
    *   Solution: Replace or rebuild the valve body.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Leaf Spring Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the truck sitting lower than the front, reduced load carrying capacity, poor ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider adding helper springs or airbags for additional load support.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Steering instability, clunking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. This often involves replacing the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **FICM (Fuel Injection Control Module) Failure (6.0L Diesel Only)**

**Summary**

The 2005 Ford F-350 Super Duty has a mix of potential issues depending on the engine option. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel is particularly prone to expensive problems like EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head gasket failures, which can lead to significant repair bills. The 5.4L V8 has spark plug issues, and the transmission has a few issues. Electrical issues, such as FICM failure (diesel) and alternator problems, can also occur. While the truck is known for its robust build and towing capabilities, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major engine repairs costing several thousand dollars. Addressing these potential problems proactively can help ensure the long-term reliability of the vehicle.
