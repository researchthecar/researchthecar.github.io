### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Ford F-350 Super Duty demonstrates strong overall reliability, particularly with its gasoline engine options and the 6-speed automatic transmission. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, while powerful, shows a propensity for potential Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) regeneration issues and fuel injector problems, which are not uncommon for modern diesel powertrains but require attention. The 10-speed automatic transmission has a reported concern regarding fluid leaks. Other systems like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are generally robust and do not present widespread reliability concerns. Owners should be mindful of diesel-specific maintenance and potential issues, but for most configurations, the F-350 is a dependable workhorse.
