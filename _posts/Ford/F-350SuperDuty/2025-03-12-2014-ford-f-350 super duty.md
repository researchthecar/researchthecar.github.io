The 2014 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse nature. Engine options include the 6.2L 2-Valve SOHC EFI V8 (gas), producing 385 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel, generating 400 horsepower and 800 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with the TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the F-350's towing capacity, powerful engine options, and overall ruggedness. Common dislikes include the firm ride, fuel economy (especially with the gas engine), and the higher cost of maintenance associated with a heavy-duty truck.
