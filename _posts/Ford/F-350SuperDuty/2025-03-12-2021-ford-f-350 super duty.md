The 2021 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its immense towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.2L Boss SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 (385 hp, 430 lb-ft of torque), the 7.3L Godzilla OHV 2-Valve PFI Gas V8 (430 hp, 475 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel (475 hp, 1,050 lb-ft of torque). The 6.2L V8 is paired with a TorqShift 6-speed automatic transmission, while both the 7.3L V8 and 6.7L diesel are paired with the TorqShift 10-speed automatic. Owners appreciate the truck's power, capability, and updated technology. However, some common complaints revolve around ride quality, particularly when unladen, and the sheer size of the vehicle can make it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces. Reliability issues, though not widespread, also contribute to owner dissatisfaction.
