Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2024 Ford F-350 Super Duty, categorized by major components and engine/transmission options. The 2024 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty truck lauded for its capability, towing capacity, and powerful engine options. Engine choices include the 6.8L V8 gas engine (405 hp, 445 lb-ft of torque), the 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 gas engine (430 hp, 485 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine (500 hp, 1200 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the truck's robust performance and comfortable interior, especially in higher trims. Common dislikes often revolve around the truck's size, fuel economy, and relatively high price point.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

*   **Fuel System Issues (Contamination)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fuel system contamination leading to potential injector failure and engine damage. This is often due to water or other contaminants entering the fuel system. Symptoms include rough running, misfires, and reduced power.
    *   Solution: Drain and flush the fuel system, replace fuel filters, inspect and potentially replace fuel injectors, and address the source of contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $8,000+ (depending on the extent of damage and injector replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8 Gas**

*   **Valve Train Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some reports of valve train noise or ticking, potentially indicating issues with lifters or other valve components.
    *   Solution: Inspection of valve train components (lifters, rocker arms, pushrods), potential replacement of worn or damaged parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+ (depending on the specific issue and parts replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh or jerky shifting, particularly between certain gears. Some owners experience a noticeable "clunk" sound during shifts. This can be more pronounced when the transmission is cold.
    *   Solution: Transmission software recalibration (reflash) is the most common first step. If the problem persists, mechanical inspection of valve body, solenoids, and internal components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (reflash); $1,000 - $4,000+ (mechanical repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay between selecting a gear (Drive or Reverse) and the transmission engaging. This can be accompanied by a slight hesitation or lag.
    *   Solution: Similar to harsh shifting, start with a transmission software recalibration. If unsuccessful, investigate valve body issues or potential internal wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 (reflash); $1,000 - $4,000+ (mechanical repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (SYNC 4) occasionally freezes, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, requiring a restart.
    *   Solution: Software updates from Ford are often released to address these issues. A hard reset of the system can sometimes provide temporary relief.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software updates); If hardware replacement is required, potentially $500 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., Blind Spot Monitoring, Parking Sensors)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: False alarms or complete failure of driver-assistance systems such as blind-spot monitoring, rear parking sensors, or lane-departure warning.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific sensor causing the issue. This may involve checking wiring connections, replacing the sensor, or recalibrating the system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per sensor/system
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Trailer Light Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of trailer lights when connected to the truck.
    *   Solution: Inspect trailer wiring, trailer connection plug on the truck, and the truck's trailer module. Replacing faulty wiring, plugs, or the trailer module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Discomfort/Poor Lumbar Support (Specific Trim Levels)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complaints of inadequate lumbar support or overall seat discomfort, particularly on long drives. This seems to be more prevalent in specific trim levels with certain seat designs.
    *   Solution: Aftermarket seat cushions or lumbar supports.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ (aftermarket solutions)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Rattles and Squeaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattles and squeaks emanating from the dashboard, door panels, or other interior trim pieces.
    *   Solution: Locating and addressing the source of the noise. This may involve tightening fasteners, adding padding, or replacing clips.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ (depending on severity and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Tailgate Issues (Power Tailgate)**

    *   Solution: Inspect and repair or replace the tailgate actuator, wiring harness, or control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Bedside Mounting Point Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Weak bedside mounting points that cause the bed to become misaligned.
    *   Solution: Remove the bed from the frame and resecure it, using the proper torque specifications. If the mounting points are compromised, they may need to be replaced or repaired.
