The 2019 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its powerful capabilities and robust construction. Engine options include the 6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8, the 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 (though this wasn't introduced until the 2020 model year, it is a common upgrade), and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel. The 6.2L V8 produces 385 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel delivers 450 horsepower and a massive 935 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission for the 6.2L V8 is a TorqShift 6-speed automatic, while the 6.7L Power Stroke is paired with a TorqShift 6-speed automatic, although some were equipped with the 10-speed automatic. Owners often praise the F-350's towing and hauling capacity, comfortable ride for a heavy-duty truck, and available technology features. Common dislikes include the truck's size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, and fuel economy, especially with the diesel engine.

**Engine**

**6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8**

*   **Valve Train Noise/Ticking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking sound, often described as a "typewriter" sound, emanating from the engine, particularly at idle or low speeds. This can sometimes be attributed to worn or damaged roller rocker arms, particularly the roller bearings on the arms failing, although it can also be exhaust manifold related.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected roller rocker arms and/or exhaust manifold studs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ depending on the extent of the damage and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Bosch CP4 high-pressure fuel pump is known to fail prematurely due to its design being sensitive to contaminated or poorly lubricated fuel. Symptoms include rough running, hard starting, fuel in the oil, and eventually complete engine shutdown.
    *   Solution: Complete fuel system replacement, including the high-pressure pump, fuel injectors, fuel rails, and fuel lines to eliminate any contaminated components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ depending on the extent of the damage and shop labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive black smoke from the exhaust, unusual turbocharger noises (whining, screeching), and potential check engine light activation. Can be caused by excessive soot buildup or mechanical failure of the turbocharger bearings or vanes.
    *   Solution: Turbocharger replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ including labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **EGR Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, reduced power, increased exhaust smoke, and potential check engine light activation. The EGR valve can become clogged with soot and carbon deposits, preventing it from functioning correctly.
    *   Solution: EGR valve cleaning or replacement. In some cases, EGR cooler replacement may also be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ depending on the specific components needing replacement and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abnormally hard or jerky shifts between gears, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. Often most noticeable between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software re-flash of the transmission control module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In other cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (re-flash) to $3,000+ (transmission rebuild).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable shaking or shuddering sensation, particularly at low speeds or during light acceleration, caused by the torque converter clutch slipping.
    *   Solution: Flushing the transmission fluid and replacing it with a Mercon ULV fluid may resolve the issue in some cases. In other cases, torque converter replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800 (fluid flush and replacement) to $1,500 - $3,000+ (torque converter replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**TorqShift 10-Speed Automatic (Limited Availability)**

*   **Harsh/Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Similar to the 6-speed, but often more pronounced, with inconsistent shift points and a general feeling of "hunting" for the correct gear.
    *   Solution: Often addressed with updated software calibrations for the transmission control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for a software update. More extensive repairs may be needed if the issue persists.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noises coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces. Caused by friction between the leaf springs.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf springs with a silicone-based lubricant or applying grease to the friction points can temporarily alleviate the noise.  In some cases, replacement of the leaf spring bushings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 (lubrication) to $500 - $1,000+ (bushing replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Intermittent Loss of Power to Infotainment System**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The infotainment system (screen, radio, navigation) randomly shuts off or freezes, and then restarts. Can be caused by a faulty APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) or loose wiring connections.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the cause of the issue. Could involve software updates, replacement of the APIM, or repair of wiring connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (wiring repair) to $500 - $1,500+ (APIM replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Trailer Brake Controller Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The integrated trailer brake controller displays error messages, fails to provide adequate braking power to the trailer, or exhibits erratic behavior.
    *   Solution: Check trailer brake wiring and connections. In some cases, the trailer brake controller module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (wiring repair) to $300 - $800+ (trailer brake controller replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion around Cab Lights**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust forming around the base of the cab lights, especially on trucks in areas with harsh winter weather or salt exposure.
    *   Solution: Removal of the cab lights, treatment of the rust, and resealing or replacement of the cab lights.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the extent of the rust damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The heated seats fail to warm up, or only heat intermittently. Often caused by a broken heating element in the seat cushion or a faulty seat heater module.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the heating element or the seat heater module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2019 Ford F-350 Super Duty generally holds up well, but owners should be aware of potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel, particularly the CP4 fuel pump failure, which can be extremely costly to repair. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and trailer brake controller can also be frustrating. While the other issues are generally less severe, they can still lead to unexpected repair costs. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended, especially for diesel models, to assess the overall condition of the engine, transmission, and other critical components.
