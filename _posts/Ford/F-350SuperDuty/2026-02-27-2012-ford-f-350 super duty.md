### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford F-350 Super Duty demonstrates solid reliability, particularly with its gasoline engine and transmission. The 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, while powerful, has a few documented issues related to its emissions control systems, specifically the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system. These can lead to performance problems and require attention. Other areas like suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior components are generally robust and do not present widespread reliability concerns. Regular maintenance, especially for the diesel emissions components, is key to ensuring long-term dependability.
