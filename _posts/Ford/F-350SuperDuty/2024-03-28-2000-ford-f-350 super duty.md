**Introduction:**

The 2000 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck available with a range of engine and transmission options, including the 7.3L Power Stroke diesel engine and the 4R100 automatic transmission. It offers impressive towing and payload capacities and is popular among commercial users and truck enthusiasts alike. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues.

**Engine**

**7.3L Power Stroke Diesel**

* **Injector Failure:** Faulty fuel injectors can cause rough idle, poor fuel economy, and reduced engine power. Replacement injectors and labor typically cost $2,000 - $3,000+.
* **Turbocharger Failure:** The turbocharger can fail due to oil leaks or excessive heat, resulting in reduced boost and loss of power. New turbocharger, gaskets, and labor can cost $1,500 - $2,500+.
* **Cylinder Head Gasket Failure:** Blown cylinder head gaskets can leak coolant or oil externally or internally, leading to overheating or engine damage. Replacement gasket, machining, and labor can cost $2,500 - $4,000+.

**Transmission**

**4R100 Automatic**

* **Overheating:** The transmission may overheat due to faulty torque converter, clogged cooler lines, or insufficient fluid. Flushing, new torque converter, or rebuild kit can cost $1,000 - $2,500+.
* **Slipping:** Worn or damaged clutch packs can cause the transmission to slip or hesitate while shifting. Transmission rebuild or replacement can cost $2,000 - $5,000+.
* **No Reverse:** A failed reverse planetary gearset or broken reverse band can result in loss of reverse gear. Repair requires transmission disassembly and replacement parts, costing $1,500 - $3,000+.

* **Ball Joint Failure:** The ball joints connecting the control arms to the steering knuckles can wear out, leading to loose steering and clunking noises. Replacement ball joints and labor cost $200 - $500+ per side.
* **Shock Absorber Failure:** Worn or leaking shock absorbers can affect ride comfort and handling. Replacement shocks and labor cost $400 - $800+ for all four.

**Electrical**

* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail due to voltage regulator issues or bearing failure, affecting battery charging and electrical systems. New alternator and labor cost $500 - $1,000+.
* **Battery Drain:** Parasitic battery drain can occur due to faulty electrical components or accessories, resulting in a dead battery. Diagnosis and repair can cost $100 - $500+.
* **Fuse Box Meltdown:** The fuse box can overheat and melt due to overloaded circuits or faulty wiring, potentially causing electrical failures. A new fuse box and labor can cost $500 - $1,000+.
