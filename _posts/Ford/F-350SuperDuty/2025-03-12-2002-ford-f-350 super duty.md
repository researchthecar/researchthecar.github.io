The 2002 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a robust workhorse known for its towing and hauling capabilities. Available engine options include the 5.4L Triton V8 (260 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (310 hp and 425 lb-ft of torque), and the legendary 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (275 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque, depending on the build date). Transmission choices consist of a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the truck's ruggedness and towing capacity, but common complaints revolve around fuel economy, particularly with the gasoline engines, and some model-year-specific reliability issues.
