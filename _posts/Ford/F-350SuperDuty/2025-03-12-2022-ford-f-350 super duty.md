Alright, here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Ford F-350 Super Duty, organized by category and drivetrain configuration. The 2022 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its immense towing and hauling capabilities. Engine options include the 6.2L Boss SOHC 2-Valve V8 (385 hp, 430 lb-ft torque), the 7.3L Godzilla OHV 2-Valve V8 (430 hp, 475 lb-ft torque), and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel (475 hp, 1,050 lb-ft torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners typically praise the F-350's ruggedness, powerful engine options, and towing capacity. Common complaints often center around ride quality when unloaded, fuel economy (especially with the gas engines), and the high cost of ownership.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The CP4 high-pressure fuel pump is known to be less tolerant of contaminated fuel. When it fails, it can send metal shavings throughout the entire fuel system (injectors, fuel rails, etc.), causing significant damage. Symptoms include hard starting, loss of power, check engine light, and eventually a non-starting condition.
    *   Solution: Complete fuel system replacement, including the fuel pump, injectors, fuel rails, fuel lines, and fuel tank cleaning. Some owners opt for a CP3 conversion kit, which replaces the CP4 pump with the more robust CP3 pump used in earlier diesel engines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ for full fuel system replacement. CP3 conversion kits can range from $2,000 - $4,000+ parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty EGT sensors can cause incorrect readings, leading to reduced engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and potential damage to the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). Check engine light will illuminate.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty EGT sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500, depending on the sensor location and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Godzilla OHV 2-Valve V8**

*   **Valve Train Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive valve train noise, particularly ticking or knocking sounds, especially at idle or low RPM. The cause is potentially related to lifter issues or rocker arm issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis required to pinpoint the source of the noise. Repair could involve replacing lifters, rocker arms, or potentially more extensive engine work if the noise is caused by internal engine damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ depending on the severity and required repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.2L Boss SOHC 2-Valve V8**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**10R140 10-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears, and a noticeable clunking sound during shifts or when decelerating. This can be caused by valve body issues, solenoid failures, or internal wear.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis required to determine the cause. Potential fixes include valve body replacement, solenoid replacement, or in some cases, a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500 for valve body or solenoid replacement. $4,000 - $8,000+ for transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking noises emanating from the leaf spring suspension, particularly when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring contact points with grease or a suitable lubricant. In some cases, replacement of worn leaf spring bushings may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200 for lubrication. $300 - $800+ for bushing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Ford SYNC infotainment system can freeze, become unresponsive, or crash intermittently. This can affect navigation, audio, and climate control functions.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset. Software updates from Ford can also address these issues. In more severe cases, replacement of the infotainment system module may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 for system reset or software update. $500 - $1500+ for module replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Trailer Blind Spot Monitoring System Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The trailer blind spot monitoring system may intermittently fail to detect vehicles in the blind spot, or provide false alerts when no vehicles are present.
    *   Solution: Check trailer wiring connections. The radar sensors may be misaligned or damaged. Replacement of sensors may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500 for wiring repairs. $400 - $1000+ for sensor replacement and recalibration.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Delamination of Chrome Badges**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The chrome finish on exterior badges (e.g., F-350, Super Duty) may peel or delaminate, particularly in areas with harsh weather conditions.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected badges.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per badge, depending on the badge and labor rates.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Heater Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat heaters failing to heat, overheating, or not functioning at all.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to determine the cause. Potential repairs include replacement of the heating element, control module, or wiring repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the component that needs replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford F-350 Super Duty can be a reliable and capable truck, but like any vehicle, it has its share of potential issues. The most concerning problems revolve around the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine (CP4 fuel pump failure) and transmission issues that affect all engine configurations. The CP4 failure is especially concerning due to the potential for very high repair costs. Electrical gremlins with the infotainment system and trailer blind spot monitoring are also fairly common. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others can be quite costly, so a thorough inspection and maintenance history review are advisable before purchasing a used 2022 F-350.
