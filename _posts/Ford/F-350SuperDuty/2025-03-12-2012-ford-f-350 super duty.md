The 2012 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its capability and workhorse reliability. Engine options included the 6.2L SOHC 2-Valve Flex Fuel V8 (385 hp, 405 lb-ft of torque) and the 6.7L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (400 hp, 800 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the F-350's towing capacity, robust build, and comfortable cabin for a heavy-duty truck. Common complaints often revolve around fuel economy (especially with the diesel engine), the stiff ride when unloaded, and the sheer size of the vehicle making it challenging to maneuver in tight spaces.
