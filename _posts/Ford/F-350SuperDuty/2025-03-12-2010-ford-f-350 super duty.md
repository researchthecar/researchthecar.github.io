**Summary**

The 2010 Ford F-350 Super Duty can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, especially with the 6.4L Power Stroke diesel engine. Issues with the EGR cooler, injectors, HPOP, and turbocharger can be expensive to repair. Suspension and electrical problems are also common, and rust can be a concern in certain climates. While the initial purchase price may be attractive, potential repair costs should be factored into the overall ownership expenses. It would be wise to have a mechanic inspect the vehicle before purchasing it, especially if it is equipped with the 6.4L diesel.
