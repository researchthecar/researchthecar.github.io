The 2006 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a heavy-duty pickup truck known for its robust capabilities and workhorse nature. It was available with several engine options: a 5.4L Triton V8 (300 hp, 365 lb-ft of torque), a 6.8L Triton V10 (362 hp, 457 lb-ft of torque), and the popular 6.0L Power Stroke turbodiesel V8 (325 hp, 570 lb-ft of torque). Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic. Owners often praise the F-350 for its towing capacity, durability, and overall performance. However, common complaints revolve around the reliability of certain components, particularly the 6.0L diesel engine, as well as its fuel economy and ride quality.

**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Turbodiesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, overheating, rough running. The EGR cooler cracks and leaks coolant into the exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler. Upgraded aftermarket EGR coolers are available that are more durable.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, oil in coolant, reduced oil pressure. The oil cooler can become clogged or crack, leading to these issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler. Often, the EGR cooler is replaced simultaneously as it's located in the same area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (may overlap with EGR cooler repair cost)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running, misfires, black smoke from exhaust, poor fuel economy. The fuel injectors can become clogged or fail electronically.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty fuel injector(s). It is often recommended to replace all injectors at once.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+ per injector.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard starting, no-start condition, stalling. The HPOP provides the necessary oil pressure to operate the fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replace the HPOP.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating, coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, bubbling in coolant reservoir, rough running. The 6.0L is prone to head gasket failure due to the use of torque-to-yield head bolts and the high cylinder pressures of the diesel engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the head gaskets. Often, the heads are resurfaced or replaced as well. Upgraded head studs are highly recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
