**Engine**

**6.0L Power Stroke Diesel V8**

*   **EGR Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR cooler cracks, leaking coolant into the intake manifold. This can cause white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and potentially hydro-lock the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler with an updated design, potentially upgrade the oil cooler to prevent recurrence.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Oil Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The factory oil cooler is prone to clogging, restricting oil flow and leading to overheating. This can lead to further engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil cooler with an updated, larger capacity design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+ (often done in conjunction with EGR cooler replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Faulty fuel injectors can cause rough running, misfires, poor fuel economy, and excessive smoke.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty injectors. It's often recommended to replace all injectors at once for consistent performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 per injector + labor
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Head Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This is a very common and serious issue. The head bolts stretch, leading to head gasket failure. Symptoms include white smoke, coolant loss, and overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the head gaskets with updated gaskets and ARP head studs to prevent future failure.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+ (major engine repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **FICM (Fuel Injection Control Module) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The FICM controls the fuel injectors. When it fails, the engine may not start, run poorly, or stall.
    *   Solution: Replace the FICM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+

**Summary**

The 2004 Ford F-350 Super Duty is a capable truck, but it's prone to several significant issues. The 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is particularly problematic, with head gasket failure, EGR cooler failure, and oil cooler failure being common and expensive repairs. Other issues, such as spark plug thread failure on the 5.4L, or exhaust manifold bolts on the 6.8L, are less severe but still require attention. Rust is also a concern, especially in colder climates. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering a purchase. The severity of the issues can range from minor inconveniences to major engine repairs costing thousands of dollars.
