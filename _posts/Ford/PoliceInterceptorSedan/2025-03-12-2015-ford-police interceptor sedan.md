The 2015 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan is a variant of the Ford Taurus designed specifically for law enforcement use. It was available with two engine options: a 3.5L naturally aspirated V6 producing around 288 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 producing around 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, both paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Some owners appreciate its robust build, spacious interior, and powerful engine options, making it a reliable workhorse. However, common complaints include rough ride quality, higher maintenance costs compared to civilian vehicles, and certain component failures due to the demanding nature of police work.

**Engine**

**3.5L Naturally Aspirated V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leak, engine overheating, potential for engine damage if not addressed promptly. The internal water pump design is prone to failure, leading to coolant mixing with the engine oil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the water pump, which requires significant labor due to its location within the engine. Also, a coolant flush and oil change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke (blue or black) from the exhaust, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining or grinding). Turbochargers are subject to extreme conditions and can fail due to oil starvation, bearing wear, or impeller damage.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected turbocharger(s), including inspection of oil lines and intercooler system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+ per turbocharger.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Stretch/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rattling noise upon startup, especially when cold; rough idling, and potential for engine misfires. Due to its design and operating environment, the timing chain can stretch, leading to timing issues.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, guides, tensioners, and potentially the phasers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,800 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration, especially at lower speeds; slipping between gears; harsh or delayed shifting. High usage and stress on the transmission in police vehicles can cause premature torque converter failure.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter, along with a transmission fluid flush and inspection of the transmission for any other damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Valve Body Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifts, failure to shift into certain gears, or complete loss of drive. Valve body failure can cause a loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the valve body. In some cases, a complete transmission rebuild may be necessary if the damage is extensive.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500 (valve body only), $2,500 - $4,500+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noise from the front suspension, especially when going over bumps; vague steering feel; uneven tire wear. The bushings in the front control arms are prone to wear and tear due to the vehicle's heavy use and potentially aggressive driving.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per side (depending on whether bushings or the entire control arm is replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing or swaying, poor handling, clunking noises from the rear suspension, and/or fluid leaking from the shock absorber. The rear shock absorbers wear out, leading to diminished damping.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per pair
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Alternator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dimming headlights, battery warning light, electrical malfunctions, and/or difficulty starting the vehicle. High electrical load demands due to police equipment can strain the alternator.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the alternator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical problems, malfunctioning lights or accessories, and/or trouble codes related to various sensors or components. The wiring harness is complex and subject to damage from heat, vibration, and modifications.
    *   Solution: Inspection and repair or replacement of damaged wiring harness sections or connectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Hinge Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sagging doors, difficulty opening or closing doors, and/or creaking or popping noises when operating the doors. The doors are frequently opened and closed in law enforcement use, leading to hinge wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the door hinges and/or hinge pins.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per door.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spotlight Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spotlight not turning on, flickering, or failing to rotate properly. This is a common wear point in high mileage Police Interceptors.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the spotlight assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Frame Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Seat moving/flexing, cracking noises, or overall weakness of the seat.
    *   Solution: Seat Frame Repair or Replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**
The 2015 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, while a capable and robust vehicle, is prone to specific issues related to its heavy-duty use. Engine issues, particularly water pump failure in the naturally aspirated V6 and turbocharger/timing chain problems in the EcoBoost V6, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially those concerning the torque converter and valve body, are also prevalent. Suspension components like control arm bushings and shock absorbers tend to wear out more quickly. Electrical problems with the alternator and wiring harnesses are other areas of concern. Exterior components like door hinges can also fail. While some of these issues are relatively minor, others can result in significant repair bills, making careful inspection and maintenance crucial when considering purchasing or owning one of these vehicles.
