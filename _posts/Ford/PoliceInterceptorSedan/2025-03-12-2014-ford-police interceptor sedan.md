The 2014 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, a purpose-built law enforcement vehicle, came with several engine and transmission options. The most common options are the 3.7L Ti-VCT V6, producing 305 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.5L EcoBoost V6, producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque.
