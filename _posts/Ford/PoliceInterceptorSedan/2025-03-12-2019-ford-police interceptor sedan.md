**Summary**

The 2019 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, while a capable and robust vehicle, is prone to certain issues due to its heavy-duty usage. Engine issues, particularly with the 3.5L EcoBoost's turbochargers, can be costly. Suspension wear is also common, and electrical problems related to wiring and alternator strain are frequently reported. Interior seat frame damage and exterior door hinge wear are not uncommon given the usage. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect these areas and factor in potential repair costs when considering a used Police Interceptor Sedan. While some issues may be minor and inexpensive to fix, others can represent significant financial burdens.
