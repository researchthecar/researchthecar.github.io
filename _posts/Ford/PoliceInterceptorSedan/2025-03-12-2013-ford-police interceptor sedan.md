The 2013 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, essentially a modified Ford Taurus, was designed for law enforcement use and offered two engine options: a 3.5L V6 and a 3.7L V6. The 3.5L V6 produces 288 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, and the 3.7L V6 produces 305 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Interceptor's robust build, powerful engine options, and spacious interior. However, some common complaints include higher fuel consumption, stiffer ride quality due to the heavy-duty suspension, and potential for electrical issues related to police equipment integration.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Internal water pump failure that leads to coolant leaking into the engine oil. This can cause engine damage and overheating. Symptoms include milky-colored engine oil, engine overheating, and low coolant levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump, flush the engine oil system, and inspect for any engine damage due to coolant contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Chain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The timing chain can stretch or fail, leading to engine misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage. Symptoms may include a rattling noise from the engine, check engine light illumination, and poor engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain, guides, and tensioners.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.7L V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 3.5L, internal water pump failure can lead to coolant leaking into the engine oil, causing engine damage and overheating. Symptoms include milky-colored engine oil, engine overheating, and low coolant levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump, flush the engine oil system, and inspect for any engine damage due to coolant contamination.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1200 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.

**Transmission**

*   **Hard Shifting/Delayed Engagement**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or reverse engagement. This can be due to valve body issues, worn clutches, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be replaced or the transmission rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt during light acceleration, typically between 30-45 mph. This is often caused by wear in the torque converter.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter, or if the damage is extensive, replace or rebuild the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $3500+ depending on the extent of the repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Control Arms**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive play in the suspension, clunking noises during turns or over bumps, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints and/or control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per side, depending on parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Damaged Wheel Bearings**
