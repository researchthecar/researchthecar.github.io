### Summary Verdict
The 2015 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan is a generally robust vehicle designed for demanding use. The most common reported issues tend to be related to the powertrain, particularly with the cooling and intake systems on the 3.7L V6, and turbocharger/direct injection systems on the 3.5L EcoBoost. Transmission issues like torque converter shudder and overheating can also occur. Suspension components, especially ball joints and bushings, may wear faster due to the harsh conditions police vehicles often face.
