The 2017 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan is a specially built vehicle designed for law enforcement use. It's based on the Ford Taurus and comes standard with a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 engine producing around 305 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque. Optional engines include a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 producing around 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engine options are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Interceptor's durability, spacious interior, and powerful engine options. Common complaints often revolve around higher maintenance costs due to its heavy-duty usage and somewhat outdated technology compared to newer vehicles.

**Engine**

**3.7L Ti-VCT V6**

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Internal water pump located within the engine fails, leading to coolant leaking into the oil pan. This can cause engine overheating and potential catastrophic engine damage due to lack of lubrication. Symptoms include engine overheating, coolant loss, milky oil, and potential engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Replace the engine if the coolant contamination has caused bearing damage. If caught early, replace the water pump and perform multiple oil changes to remove coolant.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks often develop from the valve cover gaskets, timing cover, and rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1,000+ depending on the location of the leak and severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The turbochargers can fail due to oil starvation or general wear and tear. Symptoms include loss of power, excessive turbo noise (whining or screeching), and potentially a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed turbocharger(s). It is usually recommended to replace both turbos at the same time for longevity.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $2,000 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking/Leakage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The plastic intake manifold can crack, leading to vacuum leaks and poor engine performance. Symptoms include rough idling, misfires, reduced power, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Coolant Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks develop from the turbo coolant lines, water pump, and coolant tank.
    * Solution: Replace the turbo coolant lines, water pump, or coolant tank.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,500+ depending on the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6F50)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hesitation, slipping between gears, and harsh or erratic shifting. This is often due to wear in the valve body or general transmission wear.
    *   Solution: Valve body replacement, transmission rebuild, or transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at highway speeds or during acceleration can be a sign of torque converter clutch failure.
    *   Solution: Torque converter replacement. Often recommended to flush the transmission fluid and inspect for debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear and tear on the front control arm bushings, resulting in clunking noises, wandering steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the front control arms.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Suspension Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear suspension components (shocks, springs, and bushings) can wear out quicker than normal due to the added weight of police equipment and heavier use. This can lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and noises from the rear of the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace worn shocks, springs, and bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Wiring Harness Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Due to the numerous upfits and added electrical equipment in police vehicles, the wiring harness is prone to issues such as chafing, shorts, and loose connections. This can cause various electrical problems, including malfunctioning lights, sirens, and other equipment.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the damaged wiring harness sections and secure connections.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the severity of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    * Description/Symptoms: Multiple electrical components running at once (lights, sirens, computer, camera) can cause the battery to die sooner.
    * Solution: Test battery/charging system, and replace components if needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan, while a robust and capable vehicle, is prone to several specific issues due to its heavy-duty usage. Engine-related problems, particularly with the water pump on the 3.7L V6 and turbochargers on the 3.5L EcoBoost, can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, especially rough shifting and torque converter problems, are also common. Suspension and electrical problems arise due to the vehicle's heavy use and modifications. Interior issues include seat frame and center console mounting point failures. The severity and cost of these issues can range from a few hundred dollars for minor repairs to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
