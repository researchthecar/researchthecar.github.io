The 2018 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan is a variant of the Ford Taurus designed specifically for law enforcement use. It offers enhanced durability, performance, and safety features compared to the civilian model. The engine options include a 3.5L V6 engine producing 288 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque, a 3.7L V6 engine producing 305 horsepower and 279 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine producing 365 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque.
