The 1993 Ford Tempo is a compact sedan praised for its fuel efficiency, spacious interior, and affordable price. It offers a choice of engine and transmission options: a 1.6L 8-valve SOHC engine paired with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 2.3L 16-valve DOHC engine with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. Despite its strengths, the Tempo has received criticism for its lackluster performance and dated design.
