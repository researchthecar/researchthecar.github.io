The 2000 Ford Mystique, also sold as the Mercury Mystique, was a compact sedan known for its comfortable ride and relatively fuel-efficient engines. Two engines were available: a 2.0L Zetec DOHC inline-4 producing around 125 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque, and a 2.5L Duratec DOHC V6 making approximately 170 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque. Both engines could be paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the car's nimble handling and user-friendly interior, but common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the engine and electrical systems, as well as some concerns about parts availability due to its age.

Engine problems such as coolant leaks and sensor failures are common, as are transmission issues with the automatic. Suspension components like coil springs and ball joints are also prone to wear and tear. Electrically, power window motors and alternators are known to fail. Rust can be a significant problem, depending on the vehicle's location. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others, such as transmission work or extensive rust repair, can be costly. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potential maintenance and repair costs.
