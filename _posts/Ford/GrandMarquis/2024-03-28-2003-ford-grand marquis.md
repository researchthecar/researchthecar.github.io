**Introduction**

The 2003 Ford Grand Marquis is a full-size luxury sedan that was offered with a choice of two engines and two transmissions. The standard 4.6-liter V8 engine produced 225 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, while the optional 4.6-liter V8 engine produced 239 horsepower and 287 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a four-speed automatic transmission.

Critics praised the Grand Marquis for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and powerful V8 engines. However, they also noted that the car's handling and fuel economy were not as good as some of its competitors.
