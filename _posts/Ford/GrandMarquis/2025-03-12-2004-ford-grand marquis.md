The 2004 Ford Grand Marquis is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and traditional body-on-frame construction. It typically appeals to those seeking a reliable and easy-to-maintain vehicle. The standard and most common engine is the 4.6L SOHC 2V Modular V8, producing approximately 220 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Some models, particularly the LSE and Marauder, featured higher output versions of the same engine. A common dislike is the somewhat dated styling and handling compared to more modern sedans. Some owners have reported issues with fuel economy due to the older engine design and vehicle weight. It is paired with a 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**4.6L SOHC 2V Modular V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the plastic intake manifold, typically near the coolant crossover. This can cause coolant leaks, overheating, and a rough running engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold with an updated design that addresses the weakness in the original. Some aftermarket options are made of aluminum for increased durability.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Damage**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can loosen or eject from the cylinder head due to weak threads, especially on earlier 2V heads. This can cause a loud ticking noise, misfires, and potential damage to the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repair the damaged threads using a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil). In severe cases, the cylinder head may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Heater Core Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaking into the passenger footwell, foggy windshield, and a sweet coolant smell inside the cabin.
    *   Solution: Replacing the heater core. This is a labor-intensive job as it requires removing a large portion of the dashboard.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shifting Problems/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, or failure to shift.
    *   Solution: The cause can vary from worn solenoids, a failing torque converter, or internal wear. A transmission fluid flush and filter change may help in some cases, but often a rebuild or replacement is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid change) - $3000+ (rebuild/replace)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Issues (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear suspension sagging, compressor failure, and vehicle riding unevenly. Air springs can leak over time.
    *   Solution: Replacing the air springs, compressor, and/or ride height sensors. Many owners convert to traditional coil springs to eliminate future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 (air spring replacement) - $1500+ (complete system repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or squeaking noises from the front suspension, uneven tire wear, and loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints. It's often recommended to replace both upper and lower ball joints at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inability to control the temperature of the air coming from the vents. One side may blow hot air while the other blows cold. A clicking noise might be heard behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to go up or down, or moving slowly and erratically.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the lower body panels, especially around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and trunk lid.
    *   Solution: Repair the rust damage by cutting out the affected areas and welding in new metal. This is often followed by body filler, primer, and paint.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per panel
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2004 Ford Grand Marquis is generally a reliable vehicle, but like any car of its age, it's prone to certain issues. The most concerning are the potential engine problems (intake manifold cracks and spark plug thread damage) and transmission issues, which can be costly to repair. Suspension issues, especially those related to the air suspension system (if equipped), can also add to the maintenance costs. Electrical problems with blend door actuators and window regulators are relatively common and more affordable to fix. Rust can be a significant problem depending on the vehicle's location and maintenance history. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these issues and have the vehicle thoroughly inspected before purchase.
