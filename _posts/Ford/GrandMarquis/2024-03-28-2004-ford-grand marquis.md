The 2004 Ford Grand Marquis is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and powerful V8 engine. It was available with a 4.6L V8 (224 hp, 281 lb-ft) paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, a 4.6L V8 (239 hp, 287 lb-ft) paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission, and a 5.4L V8 (260 hp, 345 lb-ft) paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

While the Grand Marquis is generally a reliable vehicle, it has experienced some issues that owners should be aware of.

### Engine

**4.6L V8 (224 hp, 281 lb-ft)**

* **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** The intake manifold gasket can fail, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include coolant and oil in the engine bay, overheating, and reduced engine power. Replacing the gasket typically costs between **$500 - $1,200**.
* **Valve Train Noise:** The valve train can develop excessive noise, especially at higher mileage. This noise is typically caused by worn camshaft lobes or lifters. Replacing the affected components costs around **$1,500 - $2,500**.

**4.6L V8 (239 hp, 287 lb-ft)**

* **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, allowing the timing chain to skip or break. Symptoms include rough idle, loss of engine power, and possibly engine damage if the chain breaks. Replacing the tensioner costs **$500 - $1,000**.

**5.4L V8 (260 hp, 345 lb-ft)**

* **Spark Plug Blowout:** The spark plugs can blow out of the cylinder heads, causing a loss of compression and engine damage. Symptoms include a rough idle, misfiring, and reduced engine power. Repairing the damage can cost over **$3,000**.
* **Intake Manifold Runner Control Valve Failure:** The intake manifold runner control valve can fail, causing the engine to run rough and stall. Replacing the valve costs around **$200 - $500**.

### Transmission

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Overheating:** The transmission can overheat, especially under heavy loads. Symptoms include slipping gears, difficulty shifting, and a burning smell. Repairing the overheating issue can cost **$1,000 - $2,000**.
* **Solenoid Failure:** The transmission solenoids can fail, causing shifting problems. Symptoms include delayed or harsh shifting, slipping gears, and possibly no movement. Replacing the solenoids costs **$400 - $1,000**.

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Torque Converter Clutch Failure:** The torque converter clutch can fail, causing shuddering and slipping during acceleration. Symptoms include vibrations, loss of acceleration power, and overheating. Replacing the torque converter clutch costs **$1,000 - $2,000**.
* **Transmission Filter Clogging:** The transmission filter can become clogged with debris, restricting fluid flow and causing shifting problems. Symptoms include delayed or harsh shifting, shuddering, and overheating. Replacing the filter costs **$150 - $300**.

### Suspension

* **Strut Mount Failure:** The strut mounts can fail, causing a clunking or rattling sound when driving over bumps. Symptoms include excessive noise, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Replacing the strut mounts costs **$400 - $800**.
* **Ball Joint Failure:** The ball joints can fail, causing a knocking or grinding sound when turning or braking. Symptoms include loose or unstable steering, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. Replacing the ball joints costs **$500 - $1,000**.

### Electrical

* **Battery Drain:** The battery can drain prematurely, especially when the vehicle is parked. Symptoms include a dead battery, difficulty starting, and electrical system problems. Diagnosing and repairing the cause of the battery drain can cost **$200 - $500**.
* **Alternator Failure:** The alternator can fail, preventing the battery from charging. Symptoms include a dead battery, flickering lights, and electrical system problems. Replacing the alternator costs **$400 - $800**.

### Exterior

* **Headlight Switch Failure:** The headlight switch can fail, preventing the headlights from turning on. Symptoms include inoperable headlights and possibly other lighting system problems. Replacing the switch costs **$200 - $400**.

### Interior

* **Power Window Motor Failure:** The power window motors can fail, causing the windows to become inoperable. Symptoms include windows that don't open or close, or that move slowly. Replacing a power window motor costs **$200 - $600**.
* **HVAC Blower Motor Failure:** The HVAC blower motor can fail, preventing the heating and air conditioning from working. Symptoms include no air flow from the vents, reduced heating or cooling efficiency, and a burning smell. Replacing the blower motor costs **$200 - $500**.

### Summary

The 2004 Ford Grand Marquis is a reliable vehicle, but it has experienced some issues that owners should be aware of. Most of the issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, but some, like spark plug blowout or transmission failure, can be more severe and costly. Overall, the Grand Marquis is a good value for its size and comfort, but potential buyers should factor in the possibility of encountering some of these issues down the road.
