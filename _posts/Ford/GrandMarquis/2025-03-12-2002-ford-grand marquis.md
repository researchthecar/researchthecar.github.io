The 2002 Ford Grand Marquis is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and traditional body-on-frame construction. The only engine option available was the 4.6L Modular V8, producing around 220 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission offering was the 4R70W 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the car's reliability, smooth ride, and ample trunk space. Common dislikes include its fuel economy compared to modern vehicles and its somewhat dated styling.

**Engine**

**4.6L Modular V8**

*   **Intake Manifold Cracks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks, often accompanied by a sweet smell. Overheating may also occur if coolant levels drop significantly. Visible cracks can sometimes be seen on the intake manifold, particularly near the thermostat housing.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold with an updated version. Many aftermarket options are available that address the weakness of the original design.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head, often with a loud popping sound. This is due to the relatively few threads in the aluminum cylinder head for the spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the cylinder head. Repair options include installing thread inserts (e.g., Time-Sert).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on repair vs. replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, stalling, or erratic idle speeds.
    *   Solution: Replace the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R70W 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Shifting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Transmission may slip or fail to shift at all.
    *   Solution: Could be related to faulty solenoids inside the transmission, valve body issues, or worn clutches. Requires diagnosis to determine the specific cause. Overhaul or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2000+ (depending on severity and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, especially during acceleration. Possible stall issues.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. It's often recommended to flush the transmission fluid and inspect for debris.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Air Suspension Failure (if equipped)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sags, compressor runs constantly, or suspension warning light illuminates.
    *   Solution: Leaks in the air springs (bags) are common. Replacement of the air springs is often the solution. The compressor or height sensors can also fail. Conversion to coil springs is an option.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on parts replaced and coil conversion vs. air suspension repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ball Joint Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noises from the front suspension, particularly when turning or going over bumps. Tire wear can also be uneven.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window moves slowly or not at all, or makes grinding noises.
    *   Solution: Replace the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Blend Door Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Temperature control issues, such as only blowing hot or cold air, or inconsistent temperature. Clicking noises from behind the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blend door actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary:**

The 2002 Ford Grand Marquis is generally a reliable vehicle, but it's prone to certain issues. The most common issues involve the engine, particularly intake manifold leaks and spark plug thread failure. Transmission issues can also occur, along with problems in the suspension system. Many of the issues are relatively inexpensive to repair, but others, like a transmission overhaul, can be quite costly. Overall, potential buyers should have a mechanic inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchase, paying close attention to these known problem areas.
