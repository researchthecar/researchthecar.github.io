### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Ford Grand Marquis is a generally durable vehicle, with its robust 4.6L V8 engine being a strong point. However, common issues tend to revolve around the intake manifold gaskets and spark plug retention on the engine, and potential torque converter or solenoid problems with the 4R70W transmission. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module and alternator, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear over time, and if equipped, the air suspension system may require attention. Interior climate control issues, such as blend door actuator failures, and instrument cluster malfunctions are also reported. Despite these potential issues, many Grand Marquis models have proven to be reliable with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
