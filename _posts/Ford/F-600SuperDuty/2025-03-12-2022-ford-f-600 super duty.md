Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints related to the 2022 Ford F-600 Super Duty, organized by category and component. The 2022 Ford F-600 Super Duty is a heavy-duty chassis cab designed for commercial applications. It's a workhorse known for its impressive towing and payload capacity. While specific horsepower and torque figures vary depending on the configuration, the available engines are generally tuned for robust performance rather than outright speed. People often praise the F-600 for its capability and durability, while potential drawbacks can include a stiffer ride compared to lighter-duty trucks and the higher operating costs associated with a larger commercial vehicle. The available engine and transmission options for the 2022 F-600 Super Duty include the 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 engine paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission, as well as the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine, also typically paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher-than-normal oil consumption in the 7.3L V8 engine. This can manifest as needing to add oil more frequently between oil changes. The engine may also emit a bluish smoke from the exhaust.
    * Solution: Diagnosis is key. Start with an oil consumption test to quantify the problem. Check for leaks, valve seal issues, and piston ring problems. Depending on the cause, the repair could range from replacing valve seals to a complete engine rebuild.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $8,000+ (depending on the repair needed)
    * Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

* **Fuel Injector Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Fuel injectors are a common failure point on diesel engines. Symptoms can include rough running, misfires, reduced power, poor fuel economy, and excessive smoke. A diagnostic trouble code (DTC) related to fuel injector performance is usually present.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty injector(s) using a scan tool. Replace the failed injector(s) with new or remanufactured units. Recoding the new injector(s) to the engine control module (ECM) may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ (per injector, including labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Turbocharger Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: The turbocharger can experience problems such as bearing failure, vane actuator issues (if equipped with a variable geometry turbocharger), and oil leaks. Symptoms include reduced power, excessive turbo noise (whining or screeching), and DTCs related to turbocharger performance.
    * Solution: Diagnose the root cause of the turbocharger issue. Depending on the severity, the turbocharger may be repairable (e.g., replacing the vane actuator) or require complete replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ (including labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic (10R140)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. Transmission slipping (engine RPM flaring without corresponding acceleration) can also occur.
    * Solution: Begin with a diagnostic scan to check for any transmission-related DTCs. Inspect the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is low or contaminated, perform a fluid and filter change. If the problem persists, further diagnosis may be needed to identify issues with the valve body, solenoids, or internal components.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $6,000+ (depending on the repair needed, ranging from fluid change to full rebuild)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Infotainment System Freezing/Crashing**
    * Description/Symptoms: The Ford infotainment system (SYNC 4 or similar) can occasionally freeze, crash, or exhibit lag. This can affect navigation, audio, and other system functions.
    * Solution: Start by performing a soft reset of the infotainment system (refer to the owner's manual for instructions). If the problem persists, check for software updates and install them. If necessary, a hard reset (factory reset) may be attempted. In some cases, hardware issues may require component replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 - $1,500+ (depending on the issue, may be covered under warranty)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Sensor Malfunctions (e.g., TPMS, ABS)**
    * Description/Symptoms: Various sensors throughout the vehicle can malfunction, leading to warning lights and potentially affecting vehicle performance. Examples include tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensors and anti-lock braking system (ABS) sensors.
    * Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor using a scan tool. Replace the malfunctioning sensor with a new unit. Recoding or relearning the new sensor to the vehicle's computer may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (per sensor, including labor)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust on Frame**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature rusting of the frame can occur, especially in regions with high road salt usage.
    * Solution: Inspect the frame regularly for rust. Apply rust inhibitors or coatings to protect the frame. For existing rust, remove it and apply a rust converter before applying a protective coating.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $2,000+ (depending on the severity of the rust and the chosen solution)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Seat Upholstery Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rips or tears in the seat upholstery can occur, particularly in high-wear areas.
    * Solution: Repair or replace the damaged upholstery. Options include patching, reupholstering the entire seat, or replacing the seat cover.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ (depending on the extent of the damage and the chosen repair method)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Ford F-600 Super Duty, while a capable and robust work truck, can experience certain issues. Engine-related problems, such as excessive oil consumption and fuel injector failures, can be costly to address. Transmission problems like harsh shifting and slipping can also be expensive to repair. Electrical issues, while less severe, can be a nuisance. Frame rust is a potential concern, especially in areas with road salt. It is important to note that these problems do not occur with all 2022 F-600s, however, these issues appear to be most prevalent among the models.
