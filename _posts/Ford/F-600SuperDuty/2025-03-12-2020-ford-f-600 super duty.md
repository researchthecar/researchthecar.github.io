Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2020 Ford F-600 Super Duty, organized by category.  The 2020 Ford F-600 Super Duty is a robust chassis cab designed for heavy-duty commercial applications. Engine options included the 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 gasoline engine producing 350 hp and 468 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 turbo diesel engine offering 330 hp and 825 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options were primarily the TorqShift 10-speed automatic. Owners often praise the F-600 for its impressive towing and payload capabilities, solid construction, and overall reliability. Common dislikes include its size and maneuverability in tight spaces, fuel economy (especially with the gasoline engine), and the cost of maintenance and repairs.

**Engine**

**7.3L "Godzilla" V8 Gasoline**

*   **Valve Spring Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Some owners have reported valve spring failures at relatively low mileage.  Symptoms include misfires, rough running, and potential engine damage if not addressed quickly.  May present as a check engine light with codes related to misfires.
    *   Solution: Replace the failed valve springs. In severe cases, the entire cylinder head may need to be replaced if the valve impacted the piston.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **CP4 Fuel Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Bosch CP4 high-pressure fuel pump, used in some 6.7L Power Stroke engines, has been known to fail. This failure can send metal debris throughout the fuel system, causing significant damage. Symptoms include a sudden loss of power, rough idling, difficulty starting, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the CP4 pump with an updated version (often a CP3 pump as a more reliable alternative) and thoroughly cleaning or replacing the entire fuel system, including injectors, fuel rails, and fuel lines.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ due to the complexity and potential for widespread fuel system contamination.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Cooler Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR cooler is prone to cracking and leaking coolant into the exhaust system. This can cause white smoke from the exhaust, coolant loss, and potentially overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the EGR cooler.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 10-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears. Slipping can also occur, especially under heavy load.
    *   Solution:  Possible causes include low transmission fluid, valve body issues, or internal wear.  Start by checking and topping off the transmission fluid.  If the problem persists, a valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid top-off) to $6,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  The heavy-duty leaf springs on the F-600, especially when regularly loaded to their maximum capacity, can sag or even crack over time.  This can lead to a reduced ride height, poor handling, and increased stress on other suspension components.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs with upgraded, heavy-duty units.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2,000+ per axle depending on the springs and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Some owners have experienced unexplained battery drain, leading to difficulty starting the vehicle, especially after it has been sitting for a few days.
    *   Solution:  Diagnose and repair any parasitic drains on the electrical system.  This may involve checking for faulty relays, modules, or aftermarket accessories that are drawing power when the vehicle is off.  A battery load test is recommended to ensure the batteries are in good condition.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the drain and the cost of replacement parts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **SYNC 3 System Freezing/Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The SYNC 3 infotainment system can experience freezing, slow response times, and other malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Try a system reset. If that doesn't work, software updates may be available. In some cases, the APIM (Accessory Protocol Interface Module) may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/update) to $500 - $1,500+ (APIM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rusting on Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported premature rusting, especially in areas prone to salt exposure (e.g., wheel wells, undercarriage).
    *   Solution: Repair and repaint affected areas. Apply rust inhibitors and protective coatings to prevent further corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $2,000+ depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Seat Upholstery Tears**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The seat upholstery, especially in high-wear areas such as the driver's seat, can tear or wear prematurely.
    *   Solution: Replace or repair the seat upholstery.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ depending on the repair method and upholstery material.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2020 Ford F-600 Super Duty, while a capable work truck, is not without its potential issues. Engine problems, particularly with the 6.7L Power Stroke's CP4 fuel pump, can be very expensive to repair. Transmission issues and suspension wear are also common concerns. Electrical gremlins and interior wear are other potential areas to watch. Severity varies depending on the issue, with engine and transmission repairs being the most costly. Buyers should thoroughly inspect any potential F-600 purchase and consider having a pre-purchase inspection performed by a qualified mechanic.
