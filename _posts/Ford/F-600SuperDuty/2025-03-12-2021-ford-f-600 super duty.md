Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2021 Ford F-600 Super Duty, formatted for your website. Please note that comprehensive, widespread data on specific issues for the F-600 can be limited compared to more popular models like the F-250 or F-350. This is due to the F-600's more specialized commercial application. Therefore, this information is compiled from available owner reports, forums, and professional mechanic insights.

The 2021 Ford F-600 Super Duty is a robust chassis cab designed for heavy-duty commercial applications. It's often praised for its impressive payload and towing capacity, allowing businesses to handle demanding tasks. Owners appreciate its powerful engine options and sturdy build. However, some find the ride quality stiff, which is typical for a vehicle in this class. Potential buyers should be aware that its specialized nature means parts and service might not be as readily available as for lighter-duty trucks. Engine options for the 2021 F-600 include the 7.3L "Godzilla" V8 producing 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, and the 6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel. The diesel produces 330 horsepower and 825 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed TorqShift automatic transmission.

    *   Solution: Inspection and adjustment of valve lash by a qualified technician.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on labor and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Turbo Diesel**

*   **Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunction of the DEF system, leading to warning lights, reduced engine power, and potential engine shutdown. Problems can include faulty DEF sensors, clogged DEF injectors, or issues with the DEF pump.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the failing component (sensor, injector, pump). Replacement of the faulty part and system reset.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1500+ depending on the part and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Catastrophic failure of the HPFP can introduce metal shavings into the fuel system, causing widespread damage to injectors and other components. Symptoms include rough running, stalling, and inability to start.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP, fuel injectors, fuel lines, and potentially the fuel tank, along with thorough cleaning of the fuel system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $8,000 - $12,000+ (this can be a very expensive repair).

    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners experience harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between certain gears. This can manifest as jerking or clunking during acceleration or deceleration. In some instances, this is more pronounced in the lower gears.
    *   Solution:  Software update/reprogramming of the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3,000+ depending on the complexity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noises emanating from the leaf spring suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Application of lubricant to the leaf spring contact points. In some cases, replacement of worn-out leaf spring bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+ depending on the severity and if bushings need to be replaced.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**

**Summary**

The 2021 Ford F-600 Super Duty, while a powerful and capable work truck, does present some potential issues for owners. The most severe problems appear to be related to the 6.7L Power Stroke diesel engine, particularly the HPFP failure, which can be a very costly repair. DEF system issues are also relatively common. Other issues, such as the transmission's harsh shifting, leaf spring squeaks, and sensor malfunctions, are typically less severe and less expensive to address. Potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor them into their purchasing decision, especially if considering a high-mileage or used F-600. Regular maintenance and proactive inspection can help mitigate some of these risks.
