Common complaints include poor fuel economy and certain reliability issues that come with age and heavy usage.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to insufficient thread engagement in the aluminum head. This often occurs during spark plug changes or under high engine stress.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with thread inserts (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of affected cylinders and repair method).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 4.6L, the 5.4L engine also suffers from spark plug thread failures in the aluminum cylinder heads.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with thread inserts (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on the number of affected cylinders and repair method).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Cam Phaser Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or rattling noise, especially at idle. Can lead to rough running and decreased performance.
    *   Solution: Replacing the cam phasers, timing chains, tensioners, and guides.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Exhaust Manifold Studs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise that gets louder when accelerating, exhaust leak smell.
    *   Solution: Replacing the exhaust manifold and broken studs. Sometimes requires removing the cylinder head for extraction.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Same issue as the V8 engines, with spark plugs ejecting from the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Thread repair using inserts (Time-Sert, Heli-Coil).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+ due to more cylinders.
    *   Recalls: None Found
