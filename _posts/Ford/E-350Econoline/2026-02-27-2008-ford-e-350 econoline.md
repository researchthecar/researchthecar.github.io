### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Ford E-350 Econoline is a capable and generally reliable van, particularly for commercial applications. However, owners should be aware of potential issues, especially with the gasoline V8 engines regarding spark plug ejection and camshaft sensor failures. The diesel 6.0L Power Stroke engine, while powerful, is known for more significant potential problems like EGR and oil cooler failures, and head gasket issues, which can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, particularly with torque converters and solenoid packs, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs can experience wear due to the van's intended use. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are not uncommon. Overall, with diligent maintenance and awareness of these common problem areas, the E-350 can remain a dependable vehicle.
