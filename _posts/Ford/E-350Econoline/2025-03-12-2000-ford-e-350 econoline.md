Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2000 Ford E-350 Econoline, organized by category and engine/transmission option, following your requested format.

The 2000 Ford E-350 Econoline is a full-size van appreciated for its durability, cargo capacity, and workhorse capabilities. However, like any vehicle of that age, it has its share of potential problems. Available engine options include the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft torque), the 6.8L Triton V10 (265 hp, 410 lb-ft torque), and the 7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (215 hp, 425 lb-ft torque). Transmission options are primarily the 4R100 4-speed automatic. Owners often praise the van's reliability and spaciousness, but common complaints revolve around fuel economy (especially with the V10), age-related component failures, and the general upkeep required for a vehicle of its size and vintage.

**Engine**

**5.4L Triton V8**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs ejecting from the cylinder head, often accompanied by a loud popping noise, misfires, and reduced engine performance. This is due to weak aluminum threads in the cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repairing the threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Helicoil). In severe cases, cylinder head replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ depending on the number of plugs and repair method.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Intake Manifold Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Cracks in the plastic intake manifold, leading to vacuum leaks, rough idling, and potential misfires.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the intake manifold.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L Triton V10**

*   **Spark Plug Blowout**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 5.4L, spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head due to weak threads.
    *   Solution: Thread repair or cylinder head replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Leaks/Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leaks from the manifold, often due to cracking or warping. This can cause a ticking noise, especially when the engine is cold, and reduced fuel economy.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the exhaust manifold and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8**

*   **Cam Position Sensor (CPS) Failure**

    *   Solution: Replacement of the CPS.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Injector Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, excessive smoke, and loss of power. Injectors can become clogged or fail over time.
    *   Solution: Injector cleaning or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per injector (if replacement is needed).
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4R100 4-Speed Automatic**

*   **Torque Converter Failure**

    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Solenoid Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or erratic shifting, failure to shift into certain gears, and transmission error codes.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty shift solenoid(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Sagging Leaf Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load-carrying capacity, and poor ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaf springs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, clunking noises from the front end, and uneven tire wear.

**Summary**

The 2000 Ford E-350 Econoline, while generally reliable, can suffer from age-related issues affecting its engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Engine problems like spark plug blowout (especially on the V8 and V10 engines) and injector issues (on the diesel) can be costly to repair. Transmission issues, like torque converter failure, can also be expensive. Suspension and electrical problems tend to be less severe but still require attention. Rust is a major concern on the exterior, particularly in areas with harsh winters. Overall, potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be prepared for potential maintenance and repair costs associated with an older van.
