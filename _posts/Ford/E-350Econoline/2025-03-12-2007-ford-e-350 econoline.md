Here is a breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2007 Ford E-350 Econoline van, organized by category and engine/transmission option as requested.

The 2007 Ford E-350 Econoline is a full-size van favored for its durability and cargo capacity, making it a popular choice for commercial use and conversions. Available engine options included the 4.6L Triton V8 (225 hp, 286 lb-ft of torque), the 5.4L Triton V8 (255 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque), and the 6.0L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8 (325 hp, 570 lb-ft of torque). All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the van's robust build and ability to handle heavy loads, but disliked its fuel economy and dated interior.

**Engine**

**4.6L Triton V8**
*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The spark plug threads in the cylinder head can strip, leading to spark plug ejection and engine misfires. This is a common issue on early 2V Triton engines.
    *   Solution: Repair the threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Helicoil) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+ depending on the repair method and number of affected cylinders.

**Summary**

The 2007 Ford E-350 Econoline is a workhorse van with known issues that vary depending on the engine choice. The Triton V8 engines are prone to spark plug thread failure and, in the case of the 5.4L, cam phaser problems. The diesel engine, while powerful, can suffer from EGR cooler, oil cooler, and injector issues. Suspension components and electrical gremlins can also surface. The severity and cost of these issues range from relatively minor repairs to major overhauls. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's history, maintenance records, and current condition, paying close attention to these common problem areas.
