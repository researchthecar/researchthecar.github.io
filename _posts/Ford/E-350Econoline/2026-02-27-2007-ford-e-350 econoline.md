### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Ford E-350 Econoline is a capable and generally reliable vehicle, particularly the gasoline V8 and V10 engines when properly maintained. However, the 6.0L Power Stroke diesel engine is known for significant potential issues, especially concerning the EGR cooler, oil cooler, and head gaskets, which can lead to substantial repair costs. Transmission reliability is decent, with common issues revolving around torque converters and solenoids, especially under heavy use. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are subject to wear due to the vehicle's nature. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are not uncommon for a vehicle of this age. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates. Interior components like the HVAC blower motor are typical wear items. Prospective buyers, especially of diesel models, should be aware of these potential costs and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections.
