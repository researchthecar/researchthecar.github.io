* **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger can malfunction, causing decreased boost pressure and power loss. Symptoms include black smoke from the exhaust, whining noises, and reduced fuel economy. Solution: Replace the turbocharger assembly. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **EGR valve failure:** The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve can become stuck or malfunction, leading to engine performance problems, increased emissions, and potential turbocharger damage. Symptoms include decreased power, rough idling, and black smoke from the exhaust. Solution: Replace the EGR valve. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Harsh shifting:** The transmission may experience rough or delayed shifting, causing discomfort and potential damage. Symptoms include jerking or shuddering during gear changes and slipping gears. Solution: Repair or replace the transmission. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,000+
* **Leaking transmission fluid:** The transmission may develop leaks, causing fluid loss and potential overheating. Symptoms include low transmission fluid levels, slipping gears, and a burning smell. Solution: Repair or replace the leaking seals or components. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+
* **Torque converter failure:** The torque converter can malfunction, causing shuddering, slipping, and overheating. Symptoms include vibration, noise during gear changes, and reduced power. Solution: Replace the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $2,000+

**5-Speed Automatic Transmission**

* **Shift solenoid failure:** The shift solenoids can become faulty, leading to transmission problems and potentially preventing the vehicle from shifting gears. Symptoms include delayed or erratic shifting, slipping gears, and illuminated check engine light. Solution: Replace the affected shift solenoid(s). Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
* **Transmission control module (TCM) failure:** The TCM can malfunction, causing various transmission issues. Symptoms include erratic shifting, limp mode, and potential loss of power. Solution: Replace the TCM. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000+
