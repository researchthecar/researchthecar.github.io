Here's a breakdown of potential issues and complaints for the 2024 Ford F-750, organized as requested. Note that since the 2024 model year is relatively new, comprehensive data on widespread issues might be limited. This information is based on general trends with heavy-duty trucks, common Ford issues, and early reports. As more data emerges, this information may evolve.

The 2024 Ford F-750 is a workhorse, designed for heavy-duty applications like construction, delivery, and utility services. It's typically favored for its robust chassis, powerful engine options, and customization possibilities. Engine options include a 7.3L V8 gas engine and a 6.7L Power Stroke V8 diesel engine.  The 7.3L gas engine delivers around 350 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque, while the 6.7L diesel provides significantly more power, with horsepower ratings up to 330 and torque up to 825 lb-ft, depending on the configuration.  Owners generally appreciate the F-750's capability and reliability, but some dislike the higher operating costs associated with heavy-duty vehicles and the complexity of modern diesel emission systems. Transmissions are generally the Ford TorqShift 6-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**6.7L Power Stroke V8 Diesel**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Frequent DPF regeneration cycles, reduced engine power, increased fuel consumption, "Exhaust Filter Overload" message. Can eventually lead to DPF clogging.
    *   Solution: Forced regeneration by the dealer, DPF cleaning, or DPF replacement.  Investigate underlying causes like faulty sensors (EGT, differential pressure), injector issues, or excessive idling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3,000+ (DPF replacement can be expensive)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **High-Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, no-start condition, metallic debris in the fuel system. This is more common in earlier 6.7L Power Stroke versions, but can still occur.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the HPFP, fuel system cleaning, and potentially injector replacement if contaminated with debris. Ford has made design changes to the HPFP over the years, so ensure the replacement part is the latest revision.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+ (due to the extensive fuel system work)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**7.3L V8 Gas Engine**

*   **Valve Train Problems**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noises from the engine, especially on cold starts, indicating potential issues with the hydraulic lifters or roller rockers.
    * Solution: Inspection of valve train components, replacement of faulty lifters or rockers, and adjustment of valve lash.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $3,500+ depending on severity and labor
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**TorqShift 6-Speed Automatic**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Clunking**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Rough shifts between gears, a noticeable "clunk" sound during shifting, especially when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution:  Check transmission fluid level and condition.  A software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may resolve the issue.  If the problem persists, valve body replacement or transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid check) - $5,000+ (rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Squeaking or groaning noises from the suspension, sagging rear suspension, reduced ride quality.  Broken or cracked leaf springs are possible under heavy use.
    *   Solution: Lubrication of leaf spring bushings, replacement of worn or broken leaf springs, inspection of shackles and U-bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+ per spring (depending on replacement parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sensor Failures (Various)**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  Check Engine Light illumination, drivability issues, inaccurate readings from gauges.  Common culprits include oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensors, and exhaust gas temperature sensors.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic scan to identify the faulty sensor, replacement of the sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+ per sensor (including diagnosis and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Wiring Harness Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent electrical issues, such as lights not working, sensors malfunctioning, or starting problems.  Can be caused by chafing, corrosion, or loose connections.
    *   Solution: Inspection of wiring harnesses, repair of damaged wires, replacement of connectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+ (depending on the complexity of the issue)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Corrosion**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust on undercarriage components, especially in areas with harsh winters or exposure to road salt.
    *   Solution: Undercoating application, rust removal and repair, regular washing to remove road salt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (undercoating) - $1,000+ (rust repair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent heating or cooling, blower motor malfunction, blend door actuator problems.
    *   Solution: Diagnostic check of HVAC system, replacement of faulty components (blower motor, blend door actuator, etc.).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2024 Ford F-750, being a relatively new model year, may not have a lot of documented widespread issues yet. However, based on trends in heavy-duty trucks and common Ford problems, potential concerns include DPF regeneration issues and HPFP failures in the 6.7L diesel, and potential Valve Train problems in the 7.3L Gas engine. Electrical sensor and wiring problems, as well as suspension issues, can also occur. The severity and cost of these issues can vary widely, from minor repairs to major component replacements. Owners should be diligent about maintenance and address any potential problems promptly to minimize downtime and costly repairs.
