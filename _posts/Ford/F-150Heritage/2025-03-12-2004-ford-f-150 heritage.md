Alright, here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2004 Ford F-150 Heritage, structured as requested. The 2004 Ford F-150 Heritage is the final year of the tenth generation F-150 and represents a more budget-friendly option compared to the redesigned 2004 F-150. It was available with two engine options: a 4.2L Essex V6 producing around 202 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, and a 4.6L Triton V8 making approximately 231 horsepower and 293 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Heritage model for its simplicity, reliability (in some respects), and lower purchase price. However, some common complaints include dated styling compared to the newer F-150, lower fuel economy, and limited features.

Engine problems such as intake manifold leaks and spark plug ejection (particularly on the 4.6L) are common and can be costly to address. Transmission issues like harsh shifting are also prevalent. Suspension components are also likely to need replacing due to age. Rust can be a major issue depending on the location of the vehicle. Interior issues, while less critical, contribute to the overall ownership experience. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle for these common problems and factor in potential repair costs. While some issues are minor, others can be quite expensive, potentially exceeding the value of the vehicle.
