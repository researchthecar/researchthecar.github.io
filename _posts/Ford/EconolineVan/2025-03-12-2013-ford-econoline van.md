The 2013 Ford Econoline Van, also known as the E-Series, is a full-size van known for its durability and versatility as a work vehicle. It was available with three engine options: a 4.6L V8 producing 225 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque, a 5.4L V8 offering 255 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, and a 6.8L V10 generating 305 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. While appreciated for its robust construction and cargo capacity, the Econoline's dated design and fuel economy were often cited as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**4.6L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head, causing a misfire and loud popping noise. This is due to weak spark plug threads in the aluminum cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repair the threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on repair method and whether the head is replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.4L V8**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head, causing a misfire and loud popping noise. This is due to weak spark plug threads in the aluminum cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repair the threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on repair method and whether the head is replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Broken Exhaust Manifold Studs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leaks, ticking noises (especially when cold), and reduced fuel economy. Broken exhaust manifold studs are a common issue due to thermal cycling and corrosion.
    *   Solution: Remove and replace the broken studs. This often requires specialized tools and techniques to avoid damaging the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6.8L V10**

*   **Spark Plug Thread Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Spark plugs can eject from the cylinder head, causing a misfire and loud popping noise. This is due to weak spark plug threads in the aluminum cylinder head.
    *   Solution: Repair the threads with a thread repair kit (e.g., Time-Sert or Heli-Coil) or replace the cylinder head.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on repair method and whether the head is replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (4R75E or similar)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping between gears, and generally rough operation. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or solenoid failures.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change may temporarily alleviate the problem. However, a more thorough inspection and repair (valve body rebuild, solenoid replacement, or transmission rebuild/replacement) is often necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Leaf Spring Sagging/Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear end sagging, reduced load capacity, and potential for spring breakage, leading to an unsafe driving condition. Common in vans that have been used to carry heavy loads.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaf springs. Consider upgrading to heavy-duty leaf springs if the van is frequently used for heavy hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rods**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loose steering, clunking noises from the front suspension, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints and/or tie rod ends. An alignment is necessary after these repairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per side)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Door Ajar Light Stays On**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The "door ajar" light illuminates even when all doors are closed. This can drain the battery.
    *   Solution: Inspect and clean the door jamb switches. Replace any faulty switches.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows stop working or operate intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially Around Wheel Wells and Body Seams)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Visible rust forming on the body panels, particularly around the wheel wells, rocker panels, and body seams.
    *   Solution: Remove rust, repair the affected area with body filler, and repaint. Preventative measures such as rustproofing can help slow down future corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $2000+ (depending on the severity and extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Summary**

The 2013 Ford Econoline Van, while a reliable workhorse, has several common issues. The engine is prone to spark plug thread failures, especially in the 4.6L, 5.4L, and 6.8L variants. The transmission may experience harsh shifting or slipping. Suspension components, especially leaf springs, can sag or break, especially if the van is used for heavy-duty applications. Electrical gremlins like a persistent "door ajar" light and power window motor failures can also occur. Exterior rust is a common concern, particularly in areas prone to corrosion. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially costly repairs, with estimated costs ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars depending on the repair. Potential buyers should carefully inspect the van for these common problems before purchasing.
