### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Ford Econoline Van demonstrates good overall reliability, especially concerning its robust powertrain options. The V8 and V10 engines, while known for specific issues like spark plug blow-out and intake manifold leaks, are generally durable when properly maintained. Automatic transmissions, particularly the 4R75E and 5R110W, can experience torque converter or solenoid issues, but these are often repairable. Suspension components like ball joints and leaf springs are common wear items for heavy-duty vehicles, but major failures are not widespread. Electrical issues, such as alternator failure, are also within expected ranges for a vehicle of this age and type. The exterior and interior generally hold up well, with no significant recurring problems reported. For its intended purpose as a work van, the 2012 Econoline offers a dependable platform with manageable repair costs for common issues.
