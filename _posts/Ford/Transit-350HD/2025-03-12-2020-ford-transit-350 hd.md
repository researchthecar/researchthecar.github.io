**Engine**

**3.5L PFDI V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various engine seals and gaskets. Common locations include the valve cover gaskets and front crankshaft seal. Can lead to oil consumption and potential engine damage if left unaddressed.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough idling, and a noticeable decrease in power. Diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) will typically indicate which cylinder is misfiring.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coil(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+

**Transmission**

**10-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or inconsistent shifts, hesitation when shifting between gears, and a general lack of smoothness during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) can resolve the issue. In more severe cases, valve body replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ for a software update, $800 - $2000+ for valve body replacement.

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs higher than normal during acceleration without a corresponding increase in speed. This can also be accompanied by a "slipping" sensation as if the transmission is not fully engaging.
    *   Solution: Inspect the transmission fluid level and condition, repair or replace the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $8,000+

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Squeaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Annoying squeaking noise coming from the rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps or uneven surfaces.
    *   Solution: Lubricating the leaf spring bushings can sometimes temporarily alleviate the noise. However, replacing the bushings or the entire leaf spring assembly may be necessary for a permanent fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ for lubrication, $200 - $800+ for bushing replacement, $500 - $1500+ for leaf spring assembly replacement.

**Electrical**

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the backup camera display. Can include a black screen, distorted image, or no image at all when the vehicle is in reverse.
    *   Solution: Inspect the camera wiring and connections for damage or corrosion. Replace the camera unit if necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

*   **Battery Drain Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the vehicle is not in use. This can lead to difficulty starting the engine or a completely dead battery.
    *   Solution: Finding and repairing the source of the electrical draw.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficulties opening or closing the sliding door, excessive noise during operation, or the door becoming misaligned.
    *   Solution: Adjusting the door alignment, lubricating the rollers and tracks, or replacing worn rollers or hinges.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $500+

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor stops working, resulting in no air coming from the vents, or the blower motor only works on certain settings.
    *   Solution: Replacing the blower motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+

**Summary**

The 2020 Ford Transit-350 HD with the 3.5L PFDI V6 engine is a capable vehicle, but owners have reported some recurring issues. Engine oil leaks and ignition coil failures can lead to moderate repair costs. The 10-speed transmission may experience shifting problems, which can be addressed with software updates or more extensive repairs like valve body replacement. Suspension squeaks, electrical malfunctions (backup camera, battery drain), and sliding door problems are also noted. While some issues are relatively minor and inexpensive to fix, others like transmission slipping can be more serious and costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these common complaints and thoroughly inspect the vehicle before purchasing, especially focusing on transmission performance and any signs of leaks.
