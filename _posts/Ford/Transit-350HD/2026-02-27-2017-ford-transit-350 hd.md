### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Ford Transit-350 HD demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its gasoline V6 engine options. The diesel engine, while powerful, has a few documented issues related to emissions control systems (DPF and EGR) that require attention and can incur moderate repair costs. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are not uncommon in vehicles of this age and type but are generally repairable. The transmission, suspension, exterior, and interior components are typically robust. For owners of the diesel variant, proactive maintenance and awareness of potential DPF/EGR issues are recommended to maintain optimal performance and avoid costly repairs.
