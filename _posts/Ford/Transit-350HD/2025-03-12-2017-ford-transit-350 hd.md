The 2017 Ford Transit-350 HD is a popular choice for commercial use and camper van conversions, offering ample cargo space and a relatively comfortable ride for a van. Available engines include a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 (275 hp, 260 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (310 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.2L Power Stroke inline-5 diesel (185 hp, 350 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (6R80). Owners often praise the Transit's spaciousness, payload capacity, and fuel economy (relative to other vans). Common complaints include the large turning radius, wind noise, and some reliability concerns.

**Summary**

The 2017 Ford Transit-350 HD has a mix of potential issues across its engine, transmission, suspension, electrical, exterior, and interior systems. While the 3.7L V6 seems relatively trouble-free, the 3.5L EcoBoost V6 can experience turbocharger and purge valve failures. The 3.2L diesel can be prone to DPF and glow plug issues. The 6R80 transmission can suffer from harsh shifting and torque converter shudder. Owners should also be aware of potential suspension sagging, electrical problems, and sliding door issues. The cost of repairs can range from minor fixes costing under $100 to major repairs exceeding $3000 or more.
