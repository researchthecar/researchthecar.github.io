The 2018 Ford Transit-350 HD is a popular choice for commercial use, van conversions, and large families. This model year offers a range of configurations and engine options. The standard engine is a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing around 275 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. There is also an optional 3.5L EcoBoost V6, boasting roughly 310 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L Power Stroke inline-5 diesel engine, rated at 185 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Common praises for the Transit-350 HD include its spacious interior, versatile configurations, and car-like handling. Criticisms often center on the ride quality, fuel economy (especially with the larger engines), and some reported reliability issues. All engine options are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission.
