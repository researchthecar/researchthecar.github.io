The 2019 Ford Transit, while offering versatility and space, can be susceptible to a range of issues. Engine problems, particularly with the EcoBoost turbochargers and Diesel DPF, can be costly. Transmission issues and electrical gremlins, like battery drain, are also fairly common. Suspension problems, especially with leaf springs, are prevalent due to the vehicle's workhorse nature and frequent heavy loading. Interior rattles and sliding door issues add to the list of potential headaches. Overall, while some issues are minor, others can lead to significant repair bills, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
