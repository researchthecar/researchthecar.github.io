## Engine

### 3.7L V6 Ti-VCT
**Coolant Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible coolant puddles under the vehicle, low coolant level warning light, engine overheating.
- **Solution:** Inspect and replace leaking hoses, water pump, or radiator. Ensure proper sealing.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700

**Oil Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Visible oil stains under the engine, burning oil smell, low oil level.
- **Solution:** Identify and replace leaking gaskets (e.g., valve cover, oil pan) or seals.
- **Cost:** $250 - $600


### 3.5L EcoBoost V6
**Turbocharger Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Loss of power, whistling or hissing sounds from the engine bay, increased exhaust smoke.
- **Solution:** Inspect and replace faulty turbocharger or associated plumbing (hoses, intercooler).
- **Cost:** $1200 - $2500

**Intake Manifold Leaks**
- **Symptoms:** Rough idle, check engine light, potential vacuum leaks.
- **Solution:** Replace the intake manifold gasket or the manifold itself if cracked.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800


### 3.2L Power Stroke I5 Diesel
**DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine power, check engine light, increased fuel consumption, regeneration failures.
- **Solution:** Perform forced regeneration, clean or replace the DPF. Ensure proper driving cycles for regeneration.
- **Cost:** $800 - $2000

**EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) System Problems**
- **Symptoms:** Rough idle, stalling, check engine light, black smoke from exhaust.
- **Solution:** Clean or replace EGR valve and cooler. Ensure proper exhaust flow.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1200


## Transmission

### 6-Speed Automatic (6R80)
**Harsh Shifting / Slipping**
- **Symptoms:** Jerky gear changes, delayed engagement, slipping between gears, transmission warning light.
- **Solution:** Check transmission fluid level and condition. May require transmission fluid flush, solenoid replacement, or internal transmission repair.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2500

**Torque Converter Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Shuddering at low speeds, slipping, whining noise.
- **Solution:** Replace the torque converter and potentially transmission fluid.
- **Cost:** $1000 - $2000


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints / Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, loose steering, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replace worn ball joints and tie rod ends. Perform wheel alignment.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

**Leaf Spring Issues**
- **Symptoms:** Sagging rear end, squeaking noises, reduced load capacity.
- **Solution:** Inspect and replace broken or fatigued leaf springs.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1000


## Electrical

### General Electrical System
**Battery Drain**
- **Symptoms:** Vehicle fails to start, dim lights, electrical components malfunctioning intermittently.
- **Solution:** Test battery and charging system. Identify parasitic draw from faulty modules or accessories.
- **Cost:** $150 - $500

**Sensor Failures (e.g., ABS, O2)**
- **Symptoms:** Check engine light, ABS warning light, poor fuel economy, rough running.
- **Solution:** Diagnose and replace faulty sensors.
- **Cost:** $200 - $600


## Exterior

### Body Panels & Doors
**Door Latch/Lock Actuator Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Doors not locking/unlocking properly, difficulty opening/closing doors.
- **Solution:** Replace faulty door latch mechanisms or lock actuators.
- **Cost:** $200 - $500


### Lighting System
**Headlight/Taillight Condensation**
- **Symptoms:** Moisture or fogging inside light housings.
- **Solution:** Inspect seals and vents. Replace housing if seal is compromised.
- **Cost:** $150 - $400


## Interior

### HVAC System
**Blower Motor Failure**
- **Symptoms:** No air coming from vents, or air only at certain speeds.
- **Solution:** Replace the blower motor or blower motor resistor.
- **Cost:** $250 - $600


### Infotainment System
**Screen Freezing/Unresponsiveness**
- **Symptoms:** Touchscreen becomes unresponsive, system freezes or reboots randomly.
- **Solution:** Software update or reset. May require replacement of the head unit.
- **Cost:** $300 - $1000

### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Ford Transit demonstrates good overall reliability, especially considering its commercial application. The most frequently cited issues tend to be related to the diesel engine's emissions control systems (DPF, EGR) and potential leaks in the gasoline engines. Automatic transmission issues like harsh shifting are also noted, though often repairable. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, can occur but are not pervasive. Exterior and interior components are generally durable, with isolated reports of door lock issues and HVAC blower motor failures. Regular maintenance and addressing early warning signs are crucial for maximizing the longevity and reliability of the 2019 Transit.
