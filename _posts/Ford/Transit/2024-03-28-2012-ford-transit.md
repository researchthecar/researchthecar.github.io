    * **Valve Cover Gasket Leak:** A faulty valve cover gasket can allow oil to leak, potentially leading to engine overheating or decreased performance. Symptoms include visible oil leaks and oil consumption. Solution involves replacing the gasket. Cost: $200 - $400+
* **3.5L V6**
    * **Intake Manifold Failure:** Cracks or warping in the intake manifold can cause vacuum leaks, resulting in rough idling, reduced power, and increased fuel consumption. Solution involves replacing the intake manifold. Cost: $800 - $1,200+
    * **Spark Plug Failure:** Premature failure of the spark plugs can cause misfiring, rough idling, and decreased performance. Solution involves replacing the spark plugs. Cost: $150 - $300+

**Transmission**

* **6-Speed Automatic**
    * **Shifting Issues:** Hard shifting, slipping, or refusal to shift gears can indicate transmission problems. Symptoms include difficulty changing gears, jerking, or loss of power. Solution may involve fluid changes, solenoid replacement, or transmission rebuild. Cost: $1,000 - $3,500+
    * **Torque Converter Failure:** A faulty torque converter can cause shuddering, slipping, or overheating during gear changes. Symptoms include vibration, noise, and loss of power. Solution involves replacing the torque converter. Cost: $1,500 - $2,500+
* **6-Speed Manual**
    * **Clutch Failure:** The clutch may slip, chatter, or become difficult to engage. Symptoms include difficulty shifting gears, grinding noises, and a burning smell. Solution involves replacing the clutch assembly. Cost: $800 - $1,500+
