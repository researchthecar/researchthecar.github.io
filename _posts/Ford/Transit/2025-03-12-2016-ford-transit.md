The 2016 Ford Transit is a versatile van popular for commercial use and camper conversions. It offered three engine options: a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing 275 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 delivering 310 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel I5 outputting 185 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Transit's spacious interior, cargo capacity, and relatively good fuel economy for its size. Common complaints include wind noise, some reliability concerns, and the van's overall size making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces.
