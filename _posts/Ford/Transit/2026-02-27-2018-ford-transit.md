### Summary Verdict
The 2018 Ford Transit demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly for its gasoline V6 engines and automatic transmission. The 3.5L EcoBoost can experience turbocharger issues, and the 3.2L Power Stroke diesel is more prone to DPF and EGR cooler problems, which are common for this type of engine under demanding use. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and infotainment glitches, are present but not overwhelmingly prevalent. The suspension, exterior, and interior components generally hold up well. For fleet operators, choosing the gasoline V6 engines may offer a slightly more reliable long-term ownership experience, while diesel variants require diligent maintenance to mitigate potential issues.
