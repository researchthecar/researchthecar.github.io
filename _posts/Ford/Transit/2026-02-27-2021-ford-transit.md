### Summary Verdict
The 2021 Ford Transit demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly for its intended commercial use. While some engine options, like the EcoBlue Diesel, have reported issues with their AdBlue systems and turbochargers, these are generally manageable with proper diagnosis and repair. The automatic transmission can occasionally exhibit shifting anomalies, but manual transmissions are typically robust. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment glitches and battery drain, are not uncommon in modern vehicles and are present in the Transit. However, these are often resolved with software updates or component checks. Suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread defects. For fleet operators, proactive maintenance and addressing early warning signs are key to maximizing the longevity and dependability of the 2021 Transit.
