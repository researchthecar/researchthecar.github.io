**Introduction:**

The 2016 Ford Transit is a versatile full-size van that debuted with three engine options: a 3.5L V6 EcoBoost, a 3.7L V6, and a 3.2L I5 Power Stroke diesel. Transmission options varied depending on the engine: the EcoBoost came with a 6-speed automatic, the 3.7L V6 could be paired with a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual, and the diesel was exclusively paired with a 6-speed automatic.

Despite its spacious interior, powerful engine, and available all-wheel drive, the 2016 Transit has faced some reliability concerns since its release.
