### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Ford Transit generally presents a solid reliability record for a commercial vehicle, particularly concerning its core powertrain components when maintained properly. However, owners should be aware of potential issues such as cooling system leaks in the V6 gasoline engines and DPF/EGR problems in the diesel variants. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can arise, often related to shifting quality. Suspension components like leaf springs and ball joints may require attention over time due to the nature of commercial use. Electrical gremlins, such as battery drain and sensor failures, are not uncommon. Exterior and interior components, like door latches and HVAC blowers, can also experience wear. Overall, proactive maintenance and addressing early signs of trouble are key to maximizing the lifespan and minimizing unexpected downtime for the 2016 Transit.
