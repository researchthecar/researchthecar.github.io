**Introduction:**

The 2015 Ford Transit is a versatile full-size cargo van available with a wide range of engine and transmission options. Its powerful engines and spacious cargo area make it popular for commercial and personal use. However, like any vehicle, it has its share of reported issues.

**Engine**

* **3.7L V6**
    * **Leaking coolant pipe:** Engine coolant leaks from a cracked or faulty coolant pipe, causing overheating and potential engine damage. Solution: Replacing the coolant pipe costs around $200 - $400+. Recall: None Found
    * **Oil leak from timing cover:** Oil seeps from a leaking timing cover gasket, resulting in low oil levels and potential engine wear. Solution: Replacing the timing cover gasket costs around $300 - $500+. Recall: None Found
* **3.5L EcoBoost V6**
    * **Turbocharger failure:** The turbocharger may fail prematurely, resulting in reduced engine power and poor fuel economy. Solution: Replacing the turbocharger is a major repair that can cost $2,000 - $3,000+. Recall: NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V570000
* **6.2L V8**
    * **No major issues reported.**

**Transmission**

* **6-speed automatic (6R80)**
    * **Transmission slipping:** The transmission may slip gears during acceleration or shifting, causing loss of power and potential gearbox damage. Solution: Repairing or rebuilding the transmission can cost $2,000 - $4,000+. Recall: None Found
* **10-speed automatic (10R80)**
    * **Early failure:** Some early production models experienced premature transmission failures due to manufacturing defects. Solution: Ford issued a recall to replace the faulty transmissions. Recall: NHTSA Campaign Number: 17V535000
* **4-speed automatic (4R70W)**
    * **No major issues reported.**

**Suspension**

* **Front suspension noise:** A rattling or clunking noise from the front suspension may indicate worn or damaged control arms or ball joints. Solution: Replacing the affected suspension components costs around $200 - $500+ per side. Recall: None Found
* **Rear leaf springs sagging:** The rear leaf springs may sag over time, reducing the vehicle's load capacity and stability. Solution: Replacing the leaf springs costs around $500 - $1,000+. Recall: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Battery drain:** A parasitic battery drain may occur when the vehicle is parked, causing the battery to discharge prematurely. Solution: Diagnosing and repairing the electrical issue can cost $100 - $300+. Recall: None Found
* **Headlight failure:** Premature failure of the headlights has been reported, causing poor visibility at night. Solution: Replacing the headlights costs around $200 - $400+ per side. Recall: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Door handle failure:** The door handles may become loose or break, making it difficult to enter or exit the vehicle. Solution: Replacing the door handles costs around $100 - $200+ per handle. Recall: None Found

**Interior**

* **Overhead console panel peeling:** The overhead console panel may peel or warp, causing an unsightly appearance. Solution: Replacing the console panel costs around $100 - $200+. Recall: None Found
* **HVAC system failure:** The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system may malfunction, resulting in poor temperature control or airflow. Solution: Repairing or replacing the HVAC components can cost $200 - $1,000+. Recall: None Found

**Summary:**

The 2015 Ford Transit offers a range of capabilities, but potential issues may arise with its engines, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. Although some issues can be minor, others, such as turbocharger failure, transmission slipping, and electrical problems, can be costly to repair. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and take preventative measures to maintain the vehicle's reliability and safety.
