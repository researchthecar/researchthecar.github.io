The 2014 Ford Transit marked a significant redesign and modernization of Ford's full-size van offering, moving away from the older E-Series vans. The 2014 Transit offers a range of engine and transmission options. One common engine option is the 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 engine, producing around 275 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Other engine options include the 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine, and the 3.2L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel I5 engine. All engines are paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (6R80). Owners often praise the Transit for its improved fuel economy, car-like handling, and increased cargo space compared to older vans. Common complaints include some reliability issues, especially with the early model years, and the relatively high cost of repairs.

**Engine**

**3.7L Ti-VCT V6**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: External coolant leaks. Common leaks appear to originate from the water pump or the thermostat housing. The vehicle may overheat if coolant levels get too low.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump and gasket, or the thermostat housing, as needed. Thoroughly inspect the cooling system for other potential leak points.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Ignition Coil Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Misfires, rough running engine, check engine light illuminated. Faulty ignition coils are a common cause.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder misfiring and replace the corresponding ignition coil. It is often recommended to replace all ignition coils at the same time for preventative maintenance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L EcoBoost V6**

*   **Turbocharger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Loss of power, excessive smoke from the exhaust, unusual noises from the engine bay (whining or screeching). Turbocharger failure is a common issue.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty turbocharger. Inspect oil lines feeding the turbo for blockages and ensure proper lubrication.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: External coolant leaks. Common leaks appear to originate from the water pump or the thermostat housing. The vehicle may overheat if coolant levels get too low.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump and gasket, or the thermostat housing, as needed. Thoroughly inspect the cooling system for other potential leak points.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L Power Stroke Turbo Diesel I5**

*   **Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine power, frequent regeneration cycles, check engine light illuminated. DPF can become clogged, especially with excessive short trips.
    *   Solution: Attempt to force a regeneration cycle using a scan tool. If unsuccessful, the DPF may need to be professionally cleaned or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough running engine, excessive smoke, poor fuel economy, difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific faulty fuel injector and replace it. Consider replacing all fuel injectors simultaneously.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (6R80)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, transmission slipping between gears, erratic shifting behavior.
    *   Solution: Start by checking the transmission fluid level and condition. If the fluid is dark or burnt, a fluid flush and filter change may help. If the problem persists, the valve body may need to be rebuilt or replaced, or the transmission itself may require an overhaul.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $4000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering at low speeds, stalling, or a complete failure to engage.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter and flush the transmission. Inspect the transmission for further damage.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Leaf Spring Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear of the van sits lower than normal, especially when loaded. This can affect handling and ride quality.
    *   Solution: Replace the rear leaf springs with new or heavy-duty units.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains overnight or within a few days, leading to a no-start condition.
    *   Solution: Perform a parasitic draw test to identify the source of the drain. Common culprits include aftermarket accessories, faulty door switches, and the Body Control Module (BCM).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power door locks fail to function correctly. The door may not lock or unlock.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty door lock actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Sliding Door Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Difficult to open or close the sliding door, noisy operation, or failure of the power sliding door mechanism.
    *   Solution: Lubricate the door tracks and rollers. If the problem persists, inspect and replace the rollers, cables, or the power sliding door motor as needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **HVAC Blower Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The blower motor stops working, resulting in no air conditioning or heat. The blower motor resistor may also fail, resulting in only one speed setting working.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty blower motor or blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2014 Ford Transit, while a modern and capable van, can suffer from various reliability issues, especially in its early model years. Engine issues such as coolant leaks, turbocharger failures (EcoBoost), and DPF problems (diesel) are common. Transmission issues with the 6R80 can be costly. Electrical problems, such as battery drain and door lock actuator failure, are also reported. The severity and cost of repairs can range from minor fixes to major component replacements. Owners should be aware of these potential issues and perform regular maintenance to minimize problems.
