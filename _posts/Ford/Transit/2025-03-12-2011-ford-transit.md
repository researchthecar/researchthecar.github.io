**Engine**

**2.3L Duratec I4 Gasoline Engine**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report higher than expected oil consumption between oil changes. This may be indicated by low oil levels and the need to add oil more frequently. Blue smoke from the exhaust can also be a symptom.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks and using the recommended oil type and viscosity are essential. If consumption is severe, a mechanic should inspect for leaks, worn piston rings, or valve stem seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (leak repairs) - $2,000+ (engine rebuild).
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The catalytic converter may fail prematurely, leading to poor fuel economy, a check engine light (usually code P0420), and reduced engine performance.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the catalytic converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+.
    * Recalls: None Found

**2.4L Duratorq TDCi Diesel Engine**

*   **Fuel Injector Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, misfires, black smoke from the exhaust, and difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of faulty fuel injectors.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ per injector.
