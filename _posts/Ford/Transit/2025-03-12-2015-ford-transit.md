The 2015 Ford Transit marked a significant redesign and expansion of Ford's commercial van lineup. Available in multiple configurations including cargo van, passenger wagon, chassis cab, and cutaway, the 2015 Transit offered a versatile platform for businesses and individuals alike. Engine options included a 3.7L Ti-VCT V6 producing 275 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 delivering 310 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L Power Stroke inline-5 diesel engine with 185 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Transit's spacious interior, improved fuel economy compared to its predecessor (the E-Series), and car-like handling. Common dislikes include some reliability concerns, particularly with early model years, and wind noise at higher speeds.
