The 2012 Ford Transit Connect is a compact cargo van lauded for its fuel efficiency, maneuverability, and practicality in urban environments. While offering versatility for small businesses and tradespeople, it's essential to be aware of its potential drawbacks. Owners often appreciate its compact size, making it easy to park and navigate tight spaces, and its affordability compared to larger vans. However, some common complaints include a lack of power, especially when fully loaded, and a somewhat basic interior. Engine options for the 2012 Transit Connect included a 2.0L Duratec I-4 engine producing 136 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired exclusively with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
