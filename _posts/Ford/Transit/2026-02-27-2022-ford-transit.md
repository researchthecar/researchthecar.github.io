### Summary Verdict
The 2022 Ford Transit demonstrates good overall reliability, particularly with its 3.5L EcoBoost V6 engine and 10-speed automatic transmission, which appear to be robust. The 2.0L EcoBlue diesel, while efficient, has seen some reports of AdBlue system and turbocharger issues, which are not uncommon for modern diesel powertrains and can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins, such as infotainment system glitches and intermittent battery drain, are present but generally manageable with software updates or component replacement. Suspension and exterior/interior components show minimal widespread problems, suggesting solid build quality in these areas. For fleet operators and individual owners, the Transit remains a dependable choice, though vigilance with the diesel's emissions system and electrical components is advised.
