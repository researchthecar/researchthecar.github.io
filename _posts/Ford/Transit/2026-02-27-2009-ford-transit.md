### Summary Verdict
The 2009 Ford Transit is a capable commercial vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with its diesel engines. DPF problems and turbocharger wear are notable concerns for both the 1.9L and 2.4L JTDm variants. Transmission reliability is generally fair, with clutch wear in manuals and torque converter issues in automatics being the most frequently reported. Suspension components like ball joints and bushings can wear out, leading to noise and handling issues. Electrical problems, such as alternator failure, are also present. While not overwhelmingly problematic, these potential repairs should be factored into the ownership cost and vehicle inspection process.
