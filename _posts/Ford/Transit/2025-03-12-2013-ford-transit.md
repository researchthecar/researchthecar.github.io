**Summary**

The 2013 Ford Transit can be a reliable workhorse, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues, particularly with the 2.2L diesel engine and the sliding door mechanism. The severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to more costly repairs. While the 2.2L diesel engine can have more serious repairs, the petrol engine has very little issues, and is more favorable. The most common issues with the automatic and manual transmissions are due to age and wear of the parts. Being vigilant about maintenance and addressing problems promptly can help extend the life of the vehicle. The total cost of ownership can vary significantly depending on the specific engine, maintenance history, and driving conditions.
