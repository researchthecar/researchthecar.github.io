The 2020 Ford Transit is a popular van known for its versatility and cargo capacity. It's available in various configurations, including cargo van, passenger van, and chassis cab, with multiple roof heights and wheelbase lengths. Engine options include a 3.5L PFDI V6 (275 hp, 262 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (310 hp, 400 lb-ft of torque), and a 2.0L EcoBlue Diesel I4 (121 hp, 221 lb-ft of torque). All engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Transit for its spaciousness, payload capacity, and driving comfort. However, some common complaints include issues with the infotainment system, build quality, and certain engine/transmission components.
