# 2023 Rivian RCV-700

### Overview
The 2023 Rivian RCV-700, a versatile electric pickup truck, has garnered attention for its innovative design and electric powertrain. As a relatively new entrant, its long-term reliability is still being established. Initial data suggests a strong performance in core areas, particularly with its electric drivetrain, which inherently has fewer moving parts than traditional internal combustion engines. However, as with any new vehicle, some early adopters have reported specific issues, primarily related to software integration and certain electronic components. The focus for this analysis is on documented technical failures, excluding routine maintenance and expected wear and tear, to provide a clear picture of the RCV-700's reliability.
