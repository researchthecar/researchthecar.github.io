*   **Motor Stator Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a "clunking" or "grinding" noise emanating from one or more of the electric motors, often during acceleration or deceleration. This is sometimes accompanied by a reduction in power or efficiency. The root cause has been identified as stator failures in certain motors.

**Summary**

The 2022 Rivian R1S presents a mixed bag of innovative technology and early production challenges. While the electric powertrain and off-road capabilities are widely praised, owners have reported a number of issues, primarily related to the electrical system, software, and powered accessories. Many of these issues are addressed under warranty, and Rivian has been actively working to improve quality through software updates and hardware revisions. The severity of the issues varies, but some can lead to vehicle immobilization or diminished functionality. The cost of repairs outside of warranty can be significant, especially for complex components like the air suspension and electric motors.
