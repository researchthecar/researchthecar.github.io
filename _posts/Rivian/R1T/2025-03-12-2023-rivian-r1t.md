The 2023 Rivian R1T is an all-electric pickup truck known for its impressive performance, innovative features, and off-road capabilities. All R1T models utilize a quad-motor all-wheel-drive system. The initial powertrain produced over 835 hp and 908 lb-ft of torque, with later dual-motor configurations offering different power levels. What people love about the R1T is its quick acceleration, comfortable ride, and practical bed design. Common dislikes include early build quality issues, software glitches, and the high price tag.
