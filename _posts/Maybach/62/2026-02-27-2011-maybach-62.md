### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Maybach 62, while a marvel of luxury engineering, presents potential reliability concerns primarily related to its complex, bespoke systems. The V12 Bi-Turbo engine, while powerful, can experience issues with ignition coils and turbochargers. The advanced 5-speed automatic transmission may encounter problems with its control module or torque converter. The sophisticated Active Body Control suspension is prone to hydraulic leaks and pump failures, which can be costly to repair. Electrical gremlins can surface in the infotainment and power-assisted door systems. Interior comfort features like massaging seats and climate control actuators also have documented failure points. Owners should anticipate higher maintenance costs and the need for specialized technicians familiar with Maybach's unique engineering.
