The 2007 Maybach 62 is the extended wheelbase version of the ultra-luxury Maybach 57 sedan, both based on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class platform. The 2007 model year was offered with a single engine option: a 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 543 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque. This engine was paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the car's opulent interior, smooth ride, and exclusivity. Common dislikes include its high maintenance costs, complex systems, and large size which makes it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces. Given its age, some parts are also becoming increasingly difficult to source.
