### Summary Verdict
The 2010 Maybach 62, while a marvel of engineering, exhibits some potential reliability concerns typical of high-end, complex vehicles of its era. The V12 twin-turbo engine can experience issues with ignition coils and turbochargers, and the 5-speed automatic transmission may face problems with its control module or torque converter. The active suspension system, a hallmark of its luxury, can be prone to hydraulic leaks and sensor malfunctions. Electrical components, particularly within the infotainment and power-closing systems, can also require attention. While the exterior remains largely robust, interior elements like the climate control and seat adjustment motors may require repairs. Owners should be prepared for potentially high repair costs associated with these luxury components, emphasizing the importance of diligent maintenance and specialized servicing.
