The 2011 Maybach 57 is the epitome of ultra-luxury, boasting handcrafted interiors, a smooth ride, and distinctive styling. It is powered by a hand-built 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine producing 543 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Maybach 57 offers an unparalleled level of customization and passenger comfort, often cited as its biggest strength. However, downsides include its high maintenance costs, complex systems prone to failure, and the sheer size of the vehicle making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces. A higher performance "S" model was available, powered by a 621-hp version of the same engine.

**Summary**

The 2011 Maybach 57, while offering unparalleled luxury, is prone to a variety of costly issues, particularly related to its complex engine, Airmatic suspension, and electrical systems. Engine oil leaks, turbocharger problems, suspension failures, and electrical gremlins are the most concerning. The estimated repair costs can range from several hundred to thousands of dollars per incident, making ownership an expensive proposition. Due to the scarcity of parts and the specialized knowledge required to service these vehicles, repairs can often only be performed at authorized Maybach or Mercedes-Benz dealerships, further increasing costs.
