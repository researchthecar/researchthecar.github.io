The 2008 Chrysler Pacifica is a crossover SUV that offered a blend of car-like handling and minivan practicality. It was available with two engine options: a 3.8L V6 producing 205 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 4.0L V6 generating 255 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Pacifica's comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available features, while common complaints included poor fuel economy, reliability issues, and a relatively uninspired driving experience.
