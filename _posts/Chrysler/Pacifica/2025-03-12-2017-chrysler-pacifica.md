**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, loss of power, check engine light illumination. Often related to worn or fouled spark plugs, faulty ignition coils, or fuel injector issues. Can sometimes be caused by internal engine issues.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the specific cylinder and component causing the misfire, followed by replacement of the faulty spark plug, ignition coil, or fuel injector. More extensive repairs may be necessary if the issue stems from compression problems or valve issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil spots under the vehicle, burning oil smell, low oil level warning light. Often associated with valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, or oil filter adapter housing.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the leaking gasket or component. Some oil leaks may be minor and monitored, while others require immediate attention.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electric Motor**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (948TE)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts between gears, hesitation when accelerating, especially at lower speeds, occasional clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Software update to the transmission control module (TCM) is often the first step. In some cases, a transmission fluid flush and filter change can help. More severe cases may require valve body replacement or, in rare instances, a complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (software update) - $4000+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete loss of forward or reverse gears, inability to shift, loud grinding or clunking noises, transmission warning light.
    *   Solution: Usually requires a complete transmission rebuild or replacement. Root causes can vary, but often involve internal component failure due to design flaws or wear and tear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3500 - $7000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

No Issues Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, crashing, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity issues, navigation malfunctions, loss of audio, or the screen going black.
    *   Solution: Software updates are frequently released to address Uconnect system glitches. A hard reset (disconnecting the battery) can sometimes temporarily resolve the issue. If problems persist, the Uconnect module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $1200+ (module replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sliding Door Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sliding doors failing to open or close properly, getting stuck, making unusual noises, or the power door function not working.
    *   Solution: Check and clean the door tracks, inspect the door latches and sensors, and lubricate moving parts. The door motor or actuator may need to be replaced. Faulty wiring or control modules can also be the cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Dead battery, requiring frequent jump starts. Often caused by a parasitic draw from a faulty module, accessory, or wiring issue.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the source of the parasitic draw. This may involve disconnecting circuits one by one to identify the faulty component. The battery itself may also need to be replaced if it has been repeatedly drained.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Liftgate failing to open or close, getting stuck, making unusual noises, or the power liftgate function not working.
    *   Solution: Check the liftgate struts, sensors, and latch mechanism. The liftgate motor or actuator may need to be replaced. Faulty wiring or control modules can also be the cause.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Automatic Climate Control Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Inconsistent temperature, one side blowing hot while the other blows cold, the system not responding to adjustments, or the blower motor not working.
    *   Solution: Check the blend door actuators, temperature sensors, and refrigerant level. The climate control module may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $800+
