Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2022 Chrysler Pacifica, organized by category and engine/transmission configuration.

The 2022 Chrysler Pacifica is a minivan known for its spaciousness, comfort, and available features. It caters to families needing practicality and versatility.  A common selling point is the Stow 'n Go seating, which allows the second and third-row seats to fold completely into the floor, creating a large cargo area. The Pacifica is also available as a plug-in hybrid, offering electric-only driving range. However, some owners have reported issues with the vehicle's reliability, particularly with the electrical systems and some drivetrain components. Engine options for the 2022 Pacifica include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine producing 287 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission, and a plug-in hybrid version that uses a modified version of the 3.6L V6 with an electric motor.
