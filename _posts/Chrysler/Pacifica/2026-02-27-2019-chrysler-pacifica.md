# 2019 Chrysler Pacifica

### Overview
The 2019 Chrysler Pacifica, a popular minivan, generally offers a solid ownership experience with a focus on family utility and comfort. Reliability data suggests that while most systems perform as expected, certain areas have seen more attention from owners and technicians. The powertrain, particularly the gasoline V6 engine, is a strong point, demonstrating good durability.

### Summary Verdict
The 2019 Chrysler Pacifica is a generally reliable minivan, especially with its standard 3.6L V6 engine. The most commonly cited issues revolve around the 9-speed automatic transmission's shifting behavior and occasional infotainment system glitches. The hybrid model introduces potential complexities with its specialized powertrain components, though widespread issues are not as frequently reported as with some other hybrid systems.
