The 2020 Chrysler Pacifica is a popular minivan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available hybrid powertrain. The standard engine is a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 287 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. A plug-in hybrid variant is also available, combining a modified 3.6L V6 with an electric motor and a 16-kWh battery pack. Owners often praise the Pacifica's Stow 'n Go seating, user-friendly infotainment system, and smooth driving experience. However, some common complaints include electrical issues, specifically with the infotainment system and power sliding doors, as well as some concerns about the reliability of the 9-speed transmission.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

* **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    * Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. This can manifest as low oil level warnings, engine noise, or even engine damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: Monitoring oil levels regularly and addressing any leaks promptly. In some cases, a PCV valve replacement has been reported to resolve the issue. More severe cases may require piston ring replacement, or, in rare instances, engine replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (PCV valve) to $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Engine Misfires**
    * Description/Symptoms: Occasional misfires, particularly at idle or during acceleration. Can be triggered by faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. The check engine light may illuminate, accompanied by a diagnostic trouble code (DTC).
    * Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause of the misfire using a scan tool. Replacing faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Hybrid 3.6L Pentastar V6**

* **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic Transmission (948TE)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    * Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or delayed shifts between gears, particularly at lower speeds. Some owners have reported a "clunking" sound during shifts, along with hesitation upon acceleration.
    * Solution: Software updates to the transmission control module (TCM) have been known to improve shifting performance. In more severe cases, replacement of valve body or the entire transmission may be required.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (Software update) to $4,000+ (Transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: The engine RPMs will increase but the car will not accelerate as expected or the transmission may shift into neutral on its own.
    * Solution: In some cases a software flash has corrected the issue, but often the transmission will need to be rebuilt or replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electric Motor**

* **No Issues Found**

**Suspension**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Freezing, lagging, or crashing of the Uconnect system. Intermittent display blackouts, unresponsive touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation malfunctions have been reported.
    *   Solution: Performing a "soft reset" of the Uconnect system (holding the power and volume buttons). Software updates from Chrysler can address some of these issues. If problems persist, replacement of the Uconnect module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (reset/software update) to $1,000+ (module replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Sliding Door Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors failing to open or close reliably. Doors may become stuck, make unusual noises, or exhibit erratic behavior. This can be due to faulty door latches, motor issues, or problems with the door control module.
    *   Solution: Inspecting and lubricating door tracks and rollers. Replacing faulty door latches, motors, or the door control module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+

    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Power Liftgate Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power liftgate may fail to open or close properly. It may also stop midway.
