The 2006 Chrysler Pacifica was a crossover SUV available in front-wheel drive (FWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) configurations. Engine options included a 3.5L V6 producing 250 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Later in the model year, a 3.8L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque was introduced. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Pacifica was appreciated for its spacious interior and comfortable ride, however it faced criticisms regarding reliability, fuel economy, and overall build quality.
