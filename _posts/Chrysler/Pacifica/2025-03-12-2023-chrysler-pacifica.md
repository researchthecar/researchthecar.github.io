The 2023 Chrysler Pacifica is a popular minivan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and available hybrid powertrain. It offers a blend of practicality and features that appeal to families. The Pacifica is available with a 3.6L V6 engine producing 287 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission, or as a plug-in hybrid with the same 3.6L V6 engine paired with two electric motors. The hybrid powertrain delivers a combined 260 horsepower and offers an EPA-estimated all-electric range. Some things people like about the Pacifica are its Stow 'n Go seating, smooth ride, and user-friendly infotainment system. Common dislikes include occasional reliability concerns and the somewhat bland styling.
