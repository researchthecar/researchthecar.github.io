The 2005 Chrysler Pacifica was an early attempt at a crossover SUV, offering a blend of minivan space and SUV styling. It was available with two engine options: a 3.5L V6 producing 250 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 producing 210 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque, both paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Pacifica's comfortable ride and spacious interior, making it a decent family hauler. However, it also received criticism for its lackluster fuel economy, complicated electronics, and a reputation for unreliability. Many of the issues below occur across all engine options.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Significant oil consumption, requiring frequent topping off. Can lead to engine damage if not addressed.
    *   Solution: Inspect for leaks, perform a compression test to assess cylinder condition. If no external leaks are found, worn piston rings are likely the cause, which requires an engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $6,000+ for engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, decreased power, check engine light with misfire codes. Often caused by faulty ignition coils or spark plugs.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder misfiring, replace the ignition coil and/or spark plug.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per cylinder.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6**

*   **Valve Cover Gasket Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the valve cover, often noticeable by oil pooling around the engine or a burning oil smell.
    * Solution: Replace the valve cover gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $350.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed gear changes, slipping between gears, transmission not engaging properly, transmission error codes.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cause with a scan tool. Possible causes include low transmission fluid, faulty solenoids, or internal damage requiring a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Fluid Change) - $3,000+ (Rebuild or Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration at low speeds, particularly during light acceleration. Can also cause stalling.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll, poor handling, noises over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and/or shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sway Bar Link Failure**
