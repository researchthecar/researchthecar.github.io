### 1990 Chrysler TC by Maserati

The 1990 Chrysler TC by Maserati is a two-door, front-wheel-drive luxury coupe built by Chrysler and designed by Maserati. It was based on the Chrysler K platform shared with vehicles such as the Dodge Daytona and Plymouth Fury. The TC came equipped with a 2.2L turbocharged engine paired with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The engine produced 160 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Unfortunately, the TC received mixed reviews upon release due to its poor reliability, high price, and weak performance despite its luxurious interior and sleek exterior design.
