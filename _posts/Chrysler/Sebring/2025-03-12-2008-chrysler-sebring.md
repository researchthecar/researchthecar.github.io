The 2008 Chrysler Sebring aimed to offer a stylish and affordable mid-size sedan or convertible option. It was available with three engine choices: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing 189 horsepower and 191 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 235 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.7L and 3.5L engines came with a 6-speed automatic. Many liked the Sebring's available convertible option and its relatively low price point, while common dislikes included its perceived cheap interior quality, uninspired driving dynamics, and a reputation for reliability issues.
