### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chrysler Sebring presents a mixed reliability profile. While the 3.0L V6 engine and manual transmission generally fare well, the 2.4L I4 and particularly the 2.7L V6 engines are prone to significant issues like oil leaks and head gasket failures, respectively. Automatic transmissions can also develop shifting problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as window regulators and BCM issues, can be frustrating. Exterior rust, especially on coupes and convertibles, and convertible top mechanism failures are also notable concerns. Interior issues like HVAC blower motors are relatively common. Buyers should be particularly cautious of models with the 2.7L V6 and ensure thorough inspection of these known problem areas.
