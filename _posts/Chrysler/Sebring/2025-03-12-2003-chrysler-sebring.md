Here's a breakdown of common issues and complaints for the 2003 Chrysler Sebring, categorized as requested.

The 2003 Chrysler Sebring was offered as a sedan and convertible, aiming for affordability and style. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder engine producing around 150 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 engine producing around 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine producing around 200 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices typically consisted of a 4-speed automatic. Owners often appreciate the Sebring's comfortable ride and relatively low price point, but common complaints revolve around reliability issues and the quality of interior materials.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4 Cylinder Engine**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common, often originating from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal. Symptoms include visible oil drips under the car, a burning oil smell, and low oil levels.
    *   Solution: Replacing the leaking gasket or seal is necessary. Sometimes sealant can be applied to the valve cover and oil pan to resolve small leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on the location of the leak and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Overheating can be caused by a faulty thermostat, radiator leaks, a failing water pump, or a clogged radiator. Symptoms include the temperature gauge reading high, steam coming from under the hood, and coolant leaks.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the overheating and replace the faulty component. This might include replacing the thermostat, radiator, water pump, or flushing the cooling system.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80 - $500+ depending on the component needing replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6 Engine**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 is notorious for sludge buildup due to its oiling system design and relatively small oil capacity. Sludge restricts oil flow, leading to engine damage and potential failure. Symptoms include engine knocking, poor performance, and illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and shorter intervals can help prevent sludge. In severe cases, engine flushing or even engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (for flushing) to $2,000+ (for engine replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water pump failure is common in this engine. Symptoms include coolant leaks, overheating, and a whining noise from the front of the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump. It's often recommended to replace the timing chain at the same time due to its location and associated labor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6 Engine**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L, oil leaks are common, often from valve cover gaskets and oil pan gasket.
    *   Solution: Replace leaking gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ depending on location.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Transmission problems are common as the vehicle ages. Symptoms include harsh shifting, slipping between gears, delayed engagement, and complete transmission failure.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If that doesn't resolve the issue, more extensive repairs or a transmission rebuild/replacement may be needed.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid change) to $1,500+ (rebuild/replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter can fail, leading to shuddering during acceleration or a complete loss of drive.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500-$1200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll in turns.
    *   Solution: Replace the struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ for all four corners.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Sway Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Sway bar links are prone to breaking, causing clunking noises when driving over bumps and reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken sway bar links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+ per link, depending on labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows are prone to failure, often due to a faulty window motor or regulator.
    *   Solution: Replace the window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sensor Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various sensors, such as the oxygen sensor, crankshaft position sensor, and camshaft position sensor, can fail, leading to poor engine performance, and an illuminated check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the faulty sensor and replace it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per sensor, including diagnosis and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust is common, especially in areas where salt is used on roads. It affects the body panels, undercarriage, and exhaust system.
    *   Solution: Repairing rust depends on the severity. Minor surface rust can be sanded and repainted. More extensive rust may require welding in new metal panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the severity and extent of the rust.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Chrysler Sebring is prone to a variety of issues, particularly relating to the engine (especially the 2.7L), transmission, and electrical systems. Sludge buildup and water pump failure are major concerns for the 2.7L engine. Transmission problems are common across the board. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to costly repairs, and the overall cost of ownership can be higher compared to more reliable vehicles. Potential buyers should thoroughly inspect the vehicle and consider a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic.
