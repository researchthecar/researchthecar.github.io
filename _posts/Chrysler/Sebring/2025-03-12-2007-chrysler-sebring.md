The 2007 Chrysler Sebring was a mid-size car offered in sedan, convertible, and coupe body styles. It aimed to offer a blend of affordability and comfort. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 (173 hp, 166 lb-ft of torque), a 2.7L V6 (189 hp, 191 lb-ft of torque), and a 3.5L V6 (235 hp, 232 lb-ft of torque). The 2.4L was typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 2.7L and 3.5L engines used a 6-speed automatic. Drivers often liked the Sebring's styling, particularly the convertible, and its comfortable ride. Common dislikes included reported issues with reliability, build quality, and engine performance.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**
*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.4L engine in the 2007 Sebring sometimes experienced excessive oil consumption, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Owners may notice the need to frequently add oil between oil changes.
    *   Solution: Regular oil level checks are crucial. Some cases may require piston ring replacement or engine rebuild if the issue is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
