### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chrysler Sebring can be a budget-friendly option, but potential buyers should be prepared for common issues, particularly with the engines and transmissions. Head gasket failures on the 2.0L, timing belt concerns on the 2.4L, and intake manifold leaks on the V6 are notable engine problems. Automatic transmission issues like slipping and harsh shifting are also frequently reported. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and window regulators, can be frustrating. Convertible models may face specific top mechanism problems. While suspension and interior components can also wear out, the powertrain and electrical systems represent the most significant potential repair expenses. Thorough inspection and maintenance history review are crucial.
