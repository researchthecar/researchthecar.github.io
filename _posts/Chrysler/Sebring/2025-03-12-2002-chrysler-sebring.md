The 2002 Chrysler Sebring was available as a coupe, sedan, and convertible. It's often praised for its affordability and styling, particularly the convertible model. However, it's also frequently criticized for reliability issues, particularly with the 2.7L engine and the automatic transmissions. Owners often appreciate the comfortable ride but dislike the Sebring's overall build quality and tendencies for various components to fail. Engine options include a 2.4L I4 producing around 150 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 producing around 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 producing around 200 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options primarily consist of a 4-speed automatic.
