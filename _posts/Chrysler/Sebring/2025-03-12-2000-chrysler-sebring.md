The 2000 Chrysler Sebring was offered as a coupe, convertible, and sedan, with different engine and transmission options depending on the body style. Common owner gripes include the car's overall build quality, some cheap interior materials, and lackluster handling. Positives include decent styling (especially the convertible), comfortable ride, and relatively affordable pricing. The most common engine options for the 2000 Sebring were the 2.4L inline-4 cylinder (150 hp, 167 lb-ft of torque) and the 2.7L V6 (200 hp, 190 lb-ft of torque). A 3.0L V6 (200 hp, 205 lb-ft of torque) was also available on some models. The transmissions consisted primarily of the 4-speed automatic.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks are common around the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and crankshaft seals. Visible oil drips, burning oil smell, and low oil levels are symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Knocking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report engine knocking noises, especially during cold starts or acceleration. This may be due to excessive piston wear or worn connecting rod bearings.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions can range from using thicker oil or fuel additives to a complete engine rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (additives/oil change) - $3000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup/Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine is known for potential sludge buildup due to its oiling system design. This can lead to oil starvation, overheating, and ultimately, engine failure. Symptoms include a knocking engine, low oil pressure, and overheating.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and verifying the oil level is correct. Engine flush may help in the early stages. Major engine damage will require a rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50-$100 (Engine flush) - $3000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the water pump and intake manifold are common. Overheating and loss of coolant are symptoms.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking water pump and intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.0L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L engine, oil leaks around the valve cover gaskets and oil pan gasket are possible.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

* **4-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report rough or delayed shifting, especially between 2nd and 3rd gear. Transmission slipping can also occur.
    *   Solution: Start with a transmission fluid flush and filter change. If the problem persists, valve body issues or internal wear may require a transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200 (fluid/filter) - $1500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Torque converter failure can cause shuddering, stalling, and poor acceleration.
    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, the entire transmission may need to be replaced if damage has occurred.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn struts and shocks lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (for all four)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Sway Bar Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clicking or clunking noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the broken sway bar links.

    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Faulty Crankshaft/Camshaft Sensors**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalling, rough running, or difficulty starting can be caused by faulty crankshaft or camshaft position sensors.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**

**Summary**

The 2000 Chrysler Sebring has a variety of potential issues, with engine problems being a significant concern, particularly for the 2.7L V6 due to the potential for sludge buildup and engine failure. Transmission issues, suspension wear, and electrical problems are also common. The cost to repair these issues can range from relatively minor expenses for replacing sensors or gaskets to substantial costs for engine or transmission rebuilds/replacements. Overall, the 2000 Sebring can be an affordable car, but potential buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle and be aware of these common problems.
