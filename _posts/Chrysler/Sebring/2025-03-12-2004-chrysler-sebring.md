Here's a breakdown of common problems reported for the 2004 Chrysler Sebring, organized by category and engine/transmission option. This information is based on common complaints and repair data available for this model year.

The 2004 Chrysler Sebring came in sedan and convertible body styles and offered a blend of affordability and comfort, which appealed to many buyers. It was available with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 engine producing 150 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, a 2.7L V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.0L V6 engine producing 200 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Sebring's smooth ride and attractive styling (particularly the convertible). Common dislikes included the car's perceived lack of reliability and occasionally lackluster performance from the base engine.

**Summary:**

The 2004 Chrysler Sebring is known for certain engine issues, particularly the 2.7L V6 sludge problem, which can be quite expensive to fix. Suspension and electrical problems are also common. Repair costs can range from relatively minor (e.g., replacing gaskets) to very significant (e.g., engine or transmission replacement). Prospective buyers should carefully inspect the vehicle's maintenance history and condition, paying close attention to potential engine sludge and transmission performance. The convertible models add another layer of potential expense with top-related issues.
