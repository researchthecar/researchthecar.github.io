### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chrysler Sebring presents a mixed reliability profile. While the 3.0L V6 engine option appears to be the most robust, the 2.7L V6 is prone to significant issues like head gasket failure and timing chain problems, which can be costly to repair. Automatic transmission issues, particularly harsh shifting and slipping, are also a concern across models. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and alternator, can lead to frustrating intermittent problems. Exterior concerns like convertible top mechanism failures and interior issues such as HVAC blower motor and power window regulator failures are common. Owners should be aware of these potential weak points and budget for possible repairs, especially if purchasing a used model.
