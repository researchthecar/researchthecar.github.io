The 2001 Chrysler Town & Country is a minivan known for its versatility and family-friendliness. Engine options included a 3.3L V6 producing 158 horsepower and 203 lb-ft of torque and a 3.8L V6 rated at 180 horsepower and 240 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission (41TE). Owners often appreciated the spacious interior and comfortable ride, but common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the transmission and electrical components, and issues with the power sliding doors.
