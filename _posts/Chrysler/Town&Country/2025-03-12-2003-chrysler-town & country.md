The 2003 Chrysler Town & Country is a popular minivan known for its spaciousness, comfort, and versatility. It was offered with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 hp and 165 lb-ft of torque, a 3.3L V6 producing 180 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 producing 215 hp and 245 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the van's comfortable ride, ample cargo space, and convenient features like power sliding doors. However, common complaints include issues with reliability, particularly electrical problems, transmission issues, and premature wear of some components.
