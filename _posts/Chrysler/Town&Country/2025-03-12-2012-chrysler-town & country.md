Here is a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints associated with the 2012 Chrysler Town & Country, organized by category and component. The 2012 Chrysler Town & Country is a minivan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and Stow 'n Go seating. The sole engine option for this year is the 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine, producing 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. People generally appreciate the van's practicality and features, while some common dislikes revolve around reliability concerns and the cost of repairs.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak originating from the oil filter housing. This can manifest as oil drips under the vehicle, a burning oil smell, and/or low oil pressure warning lights. The plastic oil filter housing is prone to cracking or warping, especially due to heat cycling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the entire oil filter housing assembly. It's recommended to replace with an updated aluminum housing to prevent future issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rocker Arm Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or tapping noise from the engine, particularly at startup or idle. This may worsen over time and can lead to misfires and reduced engine performance. The rocker arms, especially those with needle bearings, can wear down or fail.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the faulty rocker arm(s). In severe cases, camshaft damage may also require replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**6-Speed Automatic (62TE)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt or jerky shifts, delayed engagement, or slipping between gears. This can be caused by valve body issues, worn clutch packs, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to pinpoint the cause (valve body, solenoids, clutch packs). Repair could range from a fluid flush and filter change to valve body replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,500+ (transmission replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering or vibration, especially at lower speeds or when accelerating. Can also cause stalling or difficulty shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Suspension Sag**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rear of the vehicle sitting noticeably lower than the front, especially when loaded with passengers or cargo. Weak or worn rear coil springs are often the cause.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the rear coil springs. Upgrading to heavy-duty springs may be recommended if the vehicle is frequently used for hauling.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Strut Mount Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or popping noise from the front suspension when going over bumps or turning. Worn strut mounts can cause noise and reduced handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the front strut mounts. It's often recommended to replace the struts at the same time if they are also worn.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Sliding Door Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors failing to open or close properly, getting stuck, or making unusual noises. This can be due to issues with the door motor, latch, or wiring harness.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis to identify the faulty component (motor, latch, wiring). Repair may involve replacing the affected part or repairing damaged wiring.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical problems, including stalling, fuel pump failure, power window issues, and difficulty starting. The TIPM controls many of the vehicle's electrical functions, and failures are relatively common.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**
