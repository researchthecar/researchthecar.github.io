The 2014 Chrysler Town & Country is a minivan known for its spacious interior, Stow 'n Go seating, and comfortable ride. It only came with one engine option, a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine that produces 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the van's practicality, family-friendly features, and relatively affordable price point. Common dislikes include reports of electrical issues, transmission problems, and the van's somewhat dated styling compared to newer minivans.
