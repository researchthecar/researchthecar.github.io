The 2012 Chrysler 200 aimed to offer a stylish and affordable mid-size sedan option. However, it was often criticized for its somewhat unrefined driving experience compared to rivals. Available engines included a 2.4L inline-4 cylinder producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.6L Pentastar V6 generating 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options consisted of a 4-speed automatic (with the 2.4L engine) and a 6-speed automatic (standard with the 3.6L and optional with the 2.4L). Owners often appreciated the 200's attractive styling and comfortable interior, especially at its price point. However, common complaints revolved around the base engine's lack of power, the 4-speed transmission's outdated feel, and various reliability issues.

**Engine**

**2.4L I4**

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly, especially at low speeds or when idling. This can be intermittent and difficult to diagnose.
    *   Solution: Check and clean the throttle body. Inspect the crankshaft position sensor and camshaft position sensor for damage or malfunction and replace if necessary. Update PCM software.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report needing to add oil frequently between oil changes. Can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: Regular monitoring of oil levels. Consider having a leak-down test performed to assess cylinder condition. If rings are worn, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idling, loss of power, check engine light. Often caused by faulty ignition coils.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the specific cylinder misfiring and replace the ignition coil on that cylinder. Replace spark plugs as necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from the oil filter adapter housing, often dripping onto the exhaust and causing a burning smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the oil filter adapter housing, including the seals and gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (paired with 2.4L I4)**

*   **Rough or Delayed Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or jerky shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear. Delayed engagement when shifting into drive or reverse.
    *   Solution: Fluid change. Consider replacing the transmission if issues persist or worsen.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Automatic (paired with 3.6L V6 and optional with 2.4L I4)**

*   **Torque Converter Shudder**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A shudder or vibration felt at highway speeds, often when the transmission is in the torque converter lockup mode.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush using the correct Mopar fluid. In some cases, the torque converter may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Shift Hesitation/Delay**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable delay when shifting gears, especially when accelerating or decelerating. The transmission may seem to "hunt" for the correct gear.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition. A software update may address some shifting issues. Internal damage may require transmission repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Clunking Noises**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling sounds coming from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps.
    *   Solution: Inspect and replace worn sway bar links, struts/shocks, ball joints, or control arm bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ per component
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A wide range of electrical problems, including fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling), difficulty starting, erratic windshield wipers, and malfunctioning power windows.
    *   Solution: Replace the TIPM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to roll up or down, often intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Headlight Condensation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Moisture buildup inside the headlight housings, reducing visibility.
    *   Solution: Remove the headlight assembly and dry it thoroughly. Check and seal any cracks or openings in the housing. Replace the headlight assembly if the damage is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+ per headlight

**Summary:**

The 2012 Chrysler 200 is plagued by a variety of issues, some more severe than others. Electrical problems related to the TIPM and engine issues such as stalling can cause significant headaches and expense. Suspension clunking and transmission shifting problems contribute to a less-than-refined driving experience. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others like replacing the TIPM or rebuilding the transmission can be quite costly. Prospective buyers should be aware of these potential issues and thoroughly inspect any 2012 Chrysler 200 before purchasing.
