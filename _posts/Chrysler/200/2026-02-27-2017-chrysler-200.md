# 2017 Chrysler 200

### Overview
The 2017 Chrysler 200, a mid-size sedan, aimed to offer a blend of style, comfort, and performance. It was available with two engine options: a standard 2.4-liter Tigershark four-cylinder and an optional more potent 3.6-liter Pentastar V6. Both were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While the 200 presented a compelling package for its segment, like any vehicle, it has specific areas where owners have reported concerns. This analysis focuses on documented technical reliability issues, excluding routine maintenance and general wear and tear, to provide a clear picture of potential long-term ownership considerations.

### Summary Verdict
The 2017 Chrysler 200 generally presents a reasonable reliability profile, with the 3.6L V6 engine being particularly robust. The primary areas of concern tend to be related to the 9-speed automatic transmission, which can exhibit shifting issues, and the 2.4L engine, which has seen reports of oil and coolant leaks. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, potential buyers should be aware of these specific components and consider pre-purchase inspections, especially for vehicles with the 2.4L engine and the 9-speed transmission. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate some of these potential issues.
