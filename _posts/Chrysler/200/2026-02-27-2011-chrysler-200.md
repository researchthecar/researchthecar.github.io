### Summary Verdict
The 2011 Chrysler 200 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the powertrain options (2.4L I4 and 3.6L V6) are generally functional, they are prone to common issues like oil and coolant leaks, which require attention. The 6-speed automatic transmission can experience shifting problems and leaks. Suspension components, particularly bushings and struts, may show wear. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, are also reported. Exterior paint issues like clear coat peeling and interior concerns such as HVAC blower motor failure and Uconnect system glitches are not uncommon. Overall, while not a vehicle plagued by catastrophic failures, owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to leaks, electrical systems, and wear items.
