The 2017 Chrysler 200 is a mid-size sedan that offered a stylish design and comfortable ride, although it was discontinued after this model year. Owners appreciated its attractive interior and user-friendly infotainment system. Criticisms frequently mentioned its cramped rear seats, uninspired handling, and reliability concerns. Engine options included a 2.4L Tigershark I4 producing 184 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 delivering 295 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**2.4L Tigershark I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored.
    *   Solution: The fix depends on the cause. In some cases, replacing the PCV valve might help. In more severe cases, engine rebuild or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCV valve) - $3000+ (engine rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine stalls unexpectedly while driving.
    *   Solution: The vehicle is a 2017, so ensure the battery is still in good condition first. If issues continue, the cause may be a faulty crank or cam position sensor, fuel pump, or other engine management components. Diagnosis is key.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners have reported coolant leaks, often from the thermostat housing or water pump.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty component (thermostat housing or water pump).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine misfires can cause rough idling, loss of power, and illumination of the check engine light.
    *   Solution: Diagnose the cause of the misfire (e.g., faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors) and replace the faulty components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have complained about harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between lower gears. Hesitation during acceleration is also reported.
    *   Solution: First, ensure the transmission fluid level is correct and perform a transmission fluid and filter change. If problems persist, the valve body or the transmission control module (TCM) may need replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid/filter change) - $2000+ (valve body/TCM replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure resulting in the inability to shift or move the vehicle.
    *   Solution: Replace the entire transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Owners report premature wear of struts, shocks, and control arm bushings, leading to a bumpy ride and clunking noises.
    *   Solution: Replace worn suspension components.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the components replaced)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect Infotainment System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect system can experience glitches, freezing, or failure to respond to inputs.
    *   Solution: Try updating the Uconnect software. If that doesn't work, the unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (software update) - $500+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Battery Drain**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The battery drains quickly, especially when the car is not driven for a few days.
    *   Solution: Have the battery and charging system tested. A parasitic draw test can help identify the source of the drain. Replace the battery or the faulty component causing the drain (e.g., faulty module, short circuit).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (new battery) - $500+ (diagnosis and repair of parasitic draw)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

**Summary**

The 2017 Chrysler 200 is plagued by a number of potential issues, primarily concerning the engine and transmission. The 9-speed automatic transmission is particularly problematic, with reports of harsh shifting and even complete failure. Engine issues like excessive oil consumption and coolant leaks also contribute to reliability concerns. Electrical issues with the Uconnect system and battery drain are also common. While some fixes are relatively inexpensive, others, like transmission or engine replacement, can be costly. Overall, the 2017 Chrysler 200 has below average reliability compared to other cars in its class.
