The 2013 Chrysler 200 was offered as a mid-size sedan and convertible, aiming to provide a stylish and affordable option in its class. It was available with three engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4L FlexFuel inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 generating 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engines were typically paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission (though some higher trims had the 6-speed), while the 3.6L came standard with a 6-speed automatic. Owners often appreciated the 200's sleek design and comfortable ride, especially the V6 model's strong acceleration. However, common complaints included the 2.4L engine's lack of power, the outdated 4-speed transmission in the base models, and some reliability concerns.

**Engine**

**Summary**

The 2013 Chrysler 200 can be a decent value for its price, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. Engine and transmission problems, particularly with the 2.4L engine and 4-speed transmission, can lead to significant repair costs. Electrical issues, particularly related to the TIPM, are also a concern. Suspension and interior issues are less severe but can still impact the overall ownership experience. Prioritizing a well-maintained example with the 3.6L V6 and thoroughly inspecting the vehicle for these common problems is crucial.
