### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Chrysler 200 presents a mixed reliability profile. While the powertrain options (2.4L I4 and 3.6L V6) are generally capable, they are prone to oil and cooling system leaks, which require attention. The 6-speed automatic transmission can exhibit issues with shifting quality and overheating, necessitating potential costly repairs. Suspension components like struts and ball joints may wear prematurely, leading to ride quality and noise issues. Electrical problems, particularly with the Body Control Module and alternator, are also noted. Exterior paint and interior upholstery can show signs of wear, and the Uconnect infotainment system may experience glitches. Overall, while not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, owners should be aware of these common issues and budget for potential repairs beyond standard maintenance.
