### Summary Verdict
The 2014 Chrysler 200 presents a mixed reliability profile. The most commonly reported issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly oil and coolant leaks in both the 2.4L and 3.6L engines, and transmission issues like harsh shifting or overheating with the 6-speed automatic. Suspension components, such as struts and control arms, can also wear out, leading to ride quality and handling concerns. Electrical gremlins, including power window problems and infotainment system glitches, are also noted. While not plagued by catastrophic failures across the board, potential buyers should be aware of these common repair areas and factor in potential maintenance costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms can help mitigate some of these reliability concerns.
