### Summary Verdict
The 2016 Chrysler 200 presents a mixed reliability profile. The most commonly reported issues revolve around the powertrain, specifically oil and coolant leaks in both engine variants and transmission performance problems with the 9-speed automatic, such as harsh shifting. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect infotainment system and occasional battery drain, are also noted. The suspension, exterior, and interior components generally appear to be more robust, with fewer widespread complaints. Prospective buyers should be aware of potential transmission and engine leak concerns and factor in possible repair costs for these areas.
