The 2014 Chrysler 200 was an attempt by Chrysler to compete in the mid-size sedan market. It offered two engine options: a 2.4L Tigershark I4 producing 184 horsepower and 173 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 295 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. The 2.4L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic or a 9-speed automatic transmission (depending on the trim level and production date), while the 3.6L engine was exclusively paired with the 9-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the stylish exterior design and available V6 power. Common dislikes included the complicated 9-speed transmission, cramped rear seating, and some build quality concerns.

**Engine**

**2.4L Tigershark I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported excessive oil consumption, requiring frequent oil top-offs between scheduled oil changes. Blue smoke may be visible from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, the issue can be addressed by replacing the PCV valve. In more severe cases, piston ring replacement or engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+, $3000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Engine Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine may stall unexpectedly while driving or idling.
    *   Solution: The issue could be caused by a faulty crankshaft or camshaft position sensor, a dirty throttle body, or a vacuum leak. Diagnosis and repair will depend on the root cause.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

**Summary**

The 2014 Chrysler 200 has several common issues, with the 9-speed automatic transmission being the most problematic. Issues with the 2.4L engine (oil consumption) and 3.6L engine (oil filter housing leaks) are also prevalent. Electrical and suspension issues are also present. While some issues can be addressed with relatively inexpensive fixes, others, such as transmission failure, can be very costly. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and thoroughly inspect any prospective vehicle before purchase. Obtaining a pre-purchase inspection from a qualified mechanic is highly recommended, with a focus on the transmission's condition.
