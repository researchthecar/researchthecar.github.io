The 2011 Chrysler 200 was an attempt to revamp the lackluster Sebring. It offered a more refined exterior, updated interior, and improved driving dynamics. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, a 2.4L "World Engine" producing 173 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 boasting 283 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 4-speed automatic (available only with the 2.4L), and a 6-speed automatic (standard with the V6 and optional on the 2.4L). Owners often praised the 200 for its comfortable ride and available V6 power, while common complaints centered around reliability issues, cheap interior materials (despite the improvements over the Sebring), and uninspired handling (especially with the base engine).

**Summary**

The 2011 Chrysler 200, while offering improvements over its predecessor, suffers from a range of reliability issues that potential buyers should be aware of. Engine problems, especially with the 2.4L, can lead to costly repairs. Electrical issues with the TIPM are also a significant concern. While some suspension and interior issues are common for vehicles of this age, the 200 seems to experience them more frequently. The severity of these issues ranges from minor annoyances to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly. Careful inspection and a thorough pre-purchase inspection are highly recommended.
