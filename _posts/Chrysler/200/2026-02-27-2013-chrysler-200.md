### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Chrysler 200 presents a mixed reliability profile. Common issues tend to revolve around the powertrain, particularly oil and coolant leaks in both the 2.4L and 3.6L engines, and occasional transmission performance problems with the 6-speed automatic. Suspension components like struts and ball joints can also experience wear. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior paint issues and interior wear are also reported. While not plagued by widespread catastrophic failures, owners should be aware of these potential repair costs and consider them when evaluating the vehicle's long-term ownership experience.
