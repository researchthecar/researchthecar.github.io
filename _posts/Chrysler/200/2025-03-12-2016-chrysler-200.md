The 2016 Chrysler 200 is a mid-size sedan that aimed to offer a stylish and well-equipped alternative in a competitive segment. Engine options included a 2.4L Tigershark I4 producing 184 hp and 173 lb-ft of torque and a 3.6L Pentastar V6 generating 295 hp and 262 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Drivers often appreciated the 200's attractive design and available features, however, some common complaints involved the car's reliability, particularly concerning the transmission and electrical systems. The limited rear visibility and tight back seat were also cited as drawbacks.

**Engine**

**2.4L Tigershark I4**
*   **Engine Stalling/Failure to Start**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls while driving or fails to start. Often occurs intermittently. May be related to the Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP) or Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP).
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty CKP or CMP sensor. Check wiring harness for damage or corrosion.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Significant oil consumption requiring frequent top-offs. May be accompanied by blue exhaust smoke.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) may help regulate oil consumption. In severe cases, engine component replacement may be necessary (piston rings, valve seals).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (PCM update) - $2000+ (engine repairs)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Engine Stalling/Failure to Start**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls while driving or fails to start. Often occurs intermittently. May be related to the Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP) or Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP).
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty CKP or CMP sensor. Check wiring harness for damage or corrosion.

**Summary**

The 2016 Chrysler 200 presents some reliability concerns, most notably with its 9-speed automatic transmission. Issues such as harsh shifting and potential failures are common and can be costly to repair. Electrical problems with the Uconnect system and battery drain also surface frequently. While the 2.4L and 3.6L engines have some common issues like stalling, the transmission problems appear to be the most significant and widespread. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor them into their purchasing decision, including budgeting for potential repairs.
