The 2002 Chrysler Concorde is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. Available engines included a 2.7L V6 (200 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.5L V6 (250 hp and 250 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Concorde for its smooth ride and ample space but cited issues with reliability and some maintenance costs as downsides.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 engine is notorious for sludge buildup, especially with infrequent oil changes. This can lead to oil starvation, causing engine knocking, overheating, and ultimately, engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and shorter intervals (3,000 miles) are crucial. If sludge is already present, engine flushing may help, but complete engine disassembly and cleaning or replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Engine flush $100 - $200; Engine replacement $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature water pump failure can lead to overheating, coolant leaks, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump. It's often recommended to replace the timing chain simultaneously, as the water pump is driven by it.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks from various locations such as valve cover gaskets and oil pan gaskets are common.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Valve cover gasket $150 - $300; Oil pan gasket $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic idling, stalling, or difficulty starting.
    *   Solution: Clean or replace the IAC valve.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $200
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (Both Engines)**

*   **Shift Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears, hard shifting, or failure to shift at all. Can be caused by worn-out clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid flush and filter change may help in minor cases. More severe cases may require valve body repair/replacement or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Fluid flush $100 - $200; Valve body repair $500 - $1000; Transmission rebuild $2,000 - $4,000+

**Summary**

The 2002 Chrysler Concorde can be a comfortable and spacious vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of some common issues. The 2.7L engine is particularly susceptible to sludge buildup, which can lead to costly repairs. Transmission problems and electrical issues can also arise. Suspension components wear out and are prone to failure on older models. Overall, the severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs potentially ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended.
