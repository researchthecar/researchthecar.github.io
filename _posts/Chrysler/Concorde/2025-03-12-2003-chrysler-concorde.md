The 2003 Chrysler Concorde is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. It was available with two engine options: a 2.7L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 generating 250 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many owners appreciated the Concorde's smooth ride and roomy cabin, particularly in the rear seats. However, some common complaints included less than stellar fuel economy, some reliability concerns, and dated styling even when new.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil consumption, engine knocking, potential engine failure. The 2.7L engine is known for its susceptibility to sludge buildup, especially if oil changes are neglected or if the incorrect type of oil is used. The small oil passages within the engine become clogged.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes using high-quality synthetic oil, engine flush treatments. In severe cases, engine replacement or rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (engine flush) - $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **No Issues Found**

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (42LE)**

*   **Shift Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Hard or delayed shifting, slipping between gears, failure to shift, "limp mode." These issues are often related to worn valve body components or solenoids within the transmission.
    *   Solution: Replacing the valve body, replacing solenoids, or performing a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (valve body/solenoid replacement), $2,000 - $4,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in corners, poor handling, premature tire wear. Struts and shocks wear out over time, especially on vehicles with high mileage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800 (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Broken Springs**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Vehicle sitting lower on one side, clunking noises over bumps. Springs can corrode and break, especially in regions with harsh winters.
    *   Solution: Replacing the broken springs, usually in pairs.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges malfunctioning, flickering lights, complete failure of the instrument cluster. This issue is often related to faulty solder joints or electronic components within the cluster itself.
    *   Solution: Repairing or replacing the instrument cluster. Some owners attempt to repair the cluster themselves by resoldering connections, while others opt for professional repair services or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on repair method and parts)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Window moving slowly or not at all, clicking sound from the door panel when attempting to operate the window.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the lower body panels, wheel wells, and undercarriage. This is more common in areas with road salt.
    *   Solution: Treating rust with rust converters and applying rust inhibitors. Significant rust damage may require panel replacement or welding.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $100 (DIY rust treatment), $500+ (panel replacement/welding)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fabric of the headliner detaching from the roof, drooping down into the cabin.
    *   Solution: Re-gluing or replacing the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ (depending on repair method and materials)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Chrysler Concorde has some known issues, with the most significant being the potential for sludge buildup in the 2.7L engine and transmission issues with the 4-speed automatic. Electrical problems with the instrument cluster and power windows are also common. Suspension issues and rust can be expected given the vehicle's age. While some repairs can be relatively inexpensive, major engine or transmission work can be costly, so a thorough inspection is essential before purchasing a used 2003 Concorde. The severity of these issues ranges from minor inconveniences to potentially catastrophic engine failure, highlighting the importance of preventative maintenance and careful inspection.
