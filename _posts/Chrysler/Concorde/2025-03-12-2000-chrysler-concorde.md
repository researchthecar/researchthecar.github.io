The 2000 Chrysler Concorde was a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.7L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.2L V6 producing 225 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. The larger 3.2L engine provided more confident acceleration and a smoother overall driving experience. Owners generally appreciated the Concorde's roomy cabin, smooth ride, and attractive styling. Common complaints included issues with reliability, particularly concerning electrical components and certain engine-related problems, as well as the car's somewhat lackluster fuel economy.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 engine is notorious for its propensity to develop excessive sludge buildup due to its oiling system design. Symptoms include engine knocking, poor performance, overheating, and eventually engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and shorter intervals can help mitigate sludge buildup. In severe cases, engine cleaning or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Engine replacement $3000 - $5000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump on the 2.7L engine is known to fail prematurely. Symptoms include coolant leaks, overheating, and a whining noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump. It's often recommended to replace the timing chain at the same time, as the water pump is driven by the timing chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

*No Issues Found*

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (42LE)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 42LE transmission can experience harsh or erratic shifting, particularly between first and second gear. This can be due to worn solenoids or valve body issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the affected solenoids or rebuilding the valve body can often resolve the issue. A complete transmission rebuild or replacement may be necessary in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 for solenoids/valve body work, $1500 - $3000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut Mount Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The strut mounts, especially on the front, can wear out and cause clunking noises, particularly when going over bumps.
    *   Solution: Replace the strut mounts. Often, it's recommended to replace the struts at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600 per axle
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Lower Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The lower control arm bushings can fail over time. Symptoms include clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the lower control arms or just the bushings.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500 per side
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Motor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power window motors are prone to failure, causing the windows to become stuck or move intermittently.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Body Control Module (BCM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The BCM can experience failures, leading to a variety of electrical problems such as intermittent lights, malfunctioning power locks, and issues with the security system.
    *   Solution: Replacing or reprogramming the BCM.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Body Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can form on the lower body panels, especially around the wheel wells and rocker panels.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or replacement of affected panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ depending on the severity
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner is prone to sagging and detaching from the roof.
    *   Solution: Replacing or re-gluing the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Chrysler Concorde, while offering a comfortable ride and spacious interior, has several potential problem areas. The most significant concerns revolve around the 2.7L engine's sludge issues, which can lead to costly repairs or engine replacement. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and power windows, are also common. Suspension components are prone to wear and require replacement. The overall cost of ownership can be higher due to these potential issues, and careful inspection and maintenance are crucial for keeping a Concorde in good running condition.
