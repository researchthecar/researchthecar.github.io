### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chrysler Concorde, while offering a comfortable ride, exhibits some common issues typical for its age and class. The powertrain, particularly the 3.5L V6 engine and 4-speed automatic transmission, can experience oil leaks, cooling system problems, and transmission shifting issues. Suspension components like ball joints and springs are also prone to wear. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and instrument cluster, can arise.
