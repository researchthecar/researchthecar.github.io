The 2004 Chrysler Concorde is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride. Engine options included a 2.7L V6 producing 200 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque and a 3.5L V6 producing 250 hp and 250 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the Concorde for its smooth ride and generous passenger room, but some common complaints revolve around reliability issues, particularly with the electrical system and some engine components. Some complaints are about the vehicle's bland styling.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

* **Sludge Buildup/Engine Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L engine is notorious for developing sludge buildup in the oil passages, leading to oil starvation and eventual engine failure. Symptoms include low oil pressure, engine knocking, and overheating.
    * Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil can help prevent sludge buildup. If the engine is already sludged, a professional engine flush might offer a temporary solution, but often engine replacement or rebuild is necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Water Pump Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The water pump on the 2.7L V6 is prone to failure, leading to coolant leaks and overheating.
    * Solution: Replacing the water pump. It's often recommended to replace the timing chain at the same time, as access requires significant labor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

* **Oil Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, particularly from valve cover gaskets and the oil pan gasket, are common on the 3.5L engine as the car ages.
    * Solution: Replacing the leaking gaskets.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per gasket replacement.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

* **Harsh Shifting/Transmission Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms:  The 4-speed automatic transmission can exhibit harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to engage. This is often due to worn valve body components or internal wear.
    * Solution:  Transmission fluid flush and filter change may help in mild cases. Valve body replacement or transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary for more severe issues.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300 (fluid/filter), $800 - $2500+ (rebuild/replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

* **Strut/Shock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms:  Worn struts and shocks lead to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and increased tire wear.
    * Solution: Replacing the struts and shocks.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800+ (for all four)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Worn or cracked control arm bushings cause clunking noises, especially when going over bumps, and can affect alignment.
    * Solution: Replacing the control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ per control arm
    * Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

* **Power Window/Door Lock Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power windows and door locks can fail due to worn motors, faulty switches, or broken wiring.
    * Solution: Replacing the faulty motors, switches, or repairing the wiring.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+ per window/lock
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Instrument cluster malfunctions, such as erratic gauge readings or complete failure, can occur.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

* **Rust**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rust can form along the bottom of the doors, fenders, and rocker panels.
    * Solution: Repair or replacement of affected body panels.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on severity.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

* **Headliner Sagging**
    * Description/Symptoms: The headliner fabric can detach from the backing board and sag.
    * Solution: Replacing the headliner.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Chrysler Concorde can be a comfortable and affordable vehicle, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues, particularly those related to the 2.7L engine's sludge problem and potential transmission issues. Electrical problems and suspension wear are also common concerns. Repair costs can range from relatively minor for some electrical or suspension components to potentially significant for engine or transmission rebuilds/replacements. The severity of the issues can range from annoying inconveniences to major mechanical failures, leading to high repair bills. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended.
