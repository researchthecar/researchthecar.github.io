The 2002 Chrysler Neon was a compact car known for its sporty handling and relatively spacious interior for its class. It came standard with a 2.0L SOHC 4-cylinder engine producing 132 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. A higher-output 2.0L DOHC engine, producing 150 hp, was also available in the R/T and ACR models. The transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 3-speed automatic. Owners generally appreciated the Neon's affordability and fuel efficiency, while common complaints revolved around reliability issues and build quality.

**Summary**

The 2002 Chrysler Neon has several common issues, with engine and transmission problems being the most significant. Oil leaks, head gasket failures, and transmission shifting problems can be costly to repair. Suspension and electrical issues, while less severe, also contribute to the overall ownership experience. Rust is a concern in certain climates. The cost of repairs can range from a few hundred dollars for minor issues to several thousand dollars for major engine or transmission work.
