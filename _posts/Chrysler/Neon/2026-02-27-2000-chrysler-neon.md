# 2000 Chrysler Neon

### Overview
The 2000 Chrysler Neon, part of the second generation of the Neon model, aimed to improve upon its predecessor's shortcomings. It featured a more refined exterior design and a slightly updated interior. Under the hood, it offered a choice of two main gasoline engines, paired with either a manual or automatic transmission. While generally considered an economical compact car, like many vehicles of its era, it had certain areas that were more prone to issues than others. This analysis focuses on common technical reliability concerns reported by owners and mechanics, excluding routine maintenance.

### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Chrysler Neon, while offering an affordable entry into compact car ownership, exhibits common issues for its age and class. Engine reliability is a key concern, with head gasket failures and oil leaks being frequently reported for both engine variants. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic, can include fluid leaks and torque converter problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are also susceptible to wear. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, can cause various system malfunctions. Exterior rust can be a significant problem in corrosive environments, and interior components like the blower motor and seat fabric may show premature wear. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early signs of trouble are crucial for managing the long-term reliability of a 2000 Neon.
