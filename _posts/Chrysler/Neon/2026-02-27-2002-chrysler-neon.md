### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chrysler Neon, while offering an economical entry into car ownership, is not without its reliability concerns. Common issues tend to revolve around the engine's head gasket and oil seals, particularly on the SOHC variant. Automatic transmissions can experience harsh shifting or torque converter problems. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the Body Control Module, are also a notable area of concern. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts may require attention. While the manual transmission is generally more robust, clutch wear is a typical maintenance item. Rust can be an issue on the exterior, especially in corrosive climates. Overall, expect potential repair costs related to these common issues, and diligent maintenance is key to mitigating them.
