The 2000 Chrysler Neon was a compact car offered in sedan and coupe body styles. It was generally considered a decent value for its price, offering reasonable fuel economy and a somewhat sporty driving experience, especially with the manual transmission. However, it suffered from a reputation for mediocre build quality and reliability. The 2000 Neon came with a 2.0L SOHC 4-cylinder engine producing 132 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options included a 5-speed manual and a 3-speed automatic. People generally liked the Neon's affordability and nimble handling. Common dislikes included its unrefined engine noise, cheap interior materials, and questionable reliability.

**Summary**

The 2000 Chrysler Neon, while affordable and somewhat sporty, suffers from a variety of reliability issues. The most significant problems are related to the engine, specifically head gasket failures, oil leaks, and timing belt issues. The automatic transmission can also experience problems. Suspension components are prone to wear, and electrical and interior issues are also common. The severity of these issues can range from minor annoyances to major repairs. The cost to fix these issues can also vary greatly, from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the problem and the extent of the damage.
