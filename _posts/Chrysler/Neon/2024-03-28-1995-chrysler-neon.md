**Introduction:**

The 1995 Chrysler Neon is a subcompact car that was available with three different engine and transmission options. The base model featured a 1.8L SOHC 132 hp engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission, while an optional 2.0L DOHC 148 hp engine was available with either a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. The Neon was well-received for its sporty handling and affordability, but it was also criticized for its lack of features and poor build quality.
