# 2001 Chrysler Neon

### Overview
The 2001 Chrysler Neon, a compact car known for its affordability and sporty handling, presented a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. While it offered an engaging driving experience for its class, certain mechanical and electrical components were prone to issues that could impact ownership costs. Owners often reported problems related to the powertrain, particularly with specific engine and transmission configurations. The electrical system also showed some vulnerabilities. Despite these potential drawbacks, many owners found the Neon to be a relatively inexpensive vehicle to maintain and repair, especially for common wear items. However, for those considering a used 2001 Neon, a thorough pre-purchase inspection focusing on these known problem areas is highly recommended.

### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chrysler Neon is a budget-friendly compact car with a history of moderate reliability concerns. Key areas to watch for include potential head gasket issues and oil leaks in the 2.0L engines, as well as transmission problems, particularly with the automatic variants. Electrical gremlins, such as BCM failures and alternator issues, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and struts can wear out prematurely. Exterior rust can be a concern depending on climate. While not a paragon of reliability, many of its issues are common to vehicles of its age and class, and repairs are generally not prohibitively expensive. Regular maintenance and addressing minor issues promptly can help mitigate larger problems.
