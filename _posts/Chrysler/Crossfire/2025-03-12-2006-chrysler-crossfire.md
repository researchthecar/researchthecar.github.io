The 2006 Chrysler Crossfire is a sporty two-seater coupe and roadster that aimed to blend American design with German engineering, as it was built on the R170 platform shared with the Mercedes-Benz SLK. The standard engine is a 3.2L naturally aspirated V6 producing 215 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque. The SRT-6 variant boasts a supercharged version of the same engine, delivering 330 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque. Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 5-speed automatic.
