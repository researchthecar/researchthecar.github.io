The 2007 Chrysler Crossfire is a unique vehicle, known for its distinctive styling and sporty handling. It came with two engine options: a 3.2L V6 producing 215 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque, and a supercharged 3.2L V6 in the SRT-6 model, boasting 330 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The base engine was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission, while the SRT-6 was exclusively equipped with the 5-speed automatic.
