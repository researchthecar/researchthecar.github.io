Here's a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2005 Chrysler Crossfire, organized by category and powertrain configuration. This information is compiled from owner reports, forums, and repair databases. The 2005 Chrysler Crossfire is a sporty coupe/roadster known for its distinctive styling and shared components with the Mercedes-Benz SLK320. Many owners appreciate the car's unique looks and handling. However, some dislike its limited practicality and reliance on Mercedes-Benz parts for repairs. The 2005 model year was offered with a 3.2L naturally aspirated V6 engine producing 215 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. It was available with either a 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission.

**Engine**

**3.2L Naturally Aspirated V6**

*   **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Engine stalls intermittently, particularly when hot. May also experience hard starting or no start condition. Diagnostic codes related to the crankshaft position sensor (CKP) will be present.
    *   Solution: Replace the crankshaft position sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Camshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to crankshaft sensor issues, potential for stalling, rough running, and trouble starting.
    *   Solution: Replace the Camshaft position sensor(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Vacuum Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough idle, poor fuel economy, Check Engine Light illumination. Vacuum leaks can stem from cracked hoses or failing intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Solution: Identify and repair or replace the leaking vacuum lines or gaskets. Smoke testing is often helpful.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ (depending on the location and severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Catalytic Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reduced engine performance, Check Engine Light (typically P0420 or P0430 codes), rattling noise from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty catalytic converter(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+ (depending on the brand and location)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic (722.6)**

*   **Transmission Conductor Plate Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, harsh shifting, getting stuck in a gear, or complete loss of gear engagement. Diagnostic trouble codes related to speed sensors or valve body performance are common.
    *   Solution: Replace the transmission conductor plate, often along with the filter and fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Fluid Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Fluid leaking from the transmission pan, shift shaft seal, or electrical connector. Low transmission fluid can lead to shifting problems and eventual transmission damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty seals or pan gasket and top up the transmission fluid.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**6-Speed Manual**

*   No Issues Found

**Suspension**

*   **Rear Spring Perch Corrosion/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms:  This is a well-documented issue, especially in areas with road salt.  The rear spring perches can corrode and eventually separate from the frame/body. This can cause a sudden drop in ride height and dangerous handling.
    *   Solution:  Welding a reinforcing plate or replacing the entire spring perch assembly.  In severe cases, the affected area of the frame/body may need repair as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the extent of the corrosion and repair method)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Front Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, especially over bumps.  Vague steering and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Central Locking System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The central locking system may fail to operate properly, either partially or completely. Doors may not lock/unlock with the remote or the interior switch.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the system can be complex, often involving checking the PSE pump (pneumatic system equipment) and related vacuum lines or electrical connections. Replacement of the PSE pump may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ (depending on the cause)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Intermittent or complete failure of the instrument cluster. Gauges may stop working, and the display may become unreadable.
    *   Solution: The instrument cluster may need to be repaired or replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Spoiler Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The automatic rear spoiler fails to deploy or retract.  The spoiler is designed to raise at higher speeds for improved aerodynamics.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty spoiler actuator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $700+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Handle Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door handles can break or become difficult to operate.

**Summary**

The 2005 Chrysler Crossfire, while stylish, has several known issues. Suspension problems, particularly rear spring perch corrosion, are a major concern due to the potential safety implications and high repair costs. Engine and transmission issues, related to sensors and conductor plates respectively, can also be costly. Electrical gremlins in the central locking system and instrument cluster can be frustrating. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can run into the thousands of dollars. Potential buyers should have a pre-purchase inspection performed by a mechanic familiar with the car and its Mercedes-Benz underpinnings. Thoroughly inspect the rear spring perches for corrosion.
