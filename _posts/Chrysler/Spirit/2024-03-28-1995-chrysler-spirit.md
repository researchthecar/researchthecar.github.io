**Introduction:**

The 1995 Chrysler Spirit is a midsize sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price. It came with two engine and transmission options:

- 2.5L V6, 152 hp, 173 lb-ft torque with a 4-speed automatic transmission (A604)
- 3.0L V6, 162 hp, 195 lb-ft torque with a 4-speed automatic transmission (A606)

Drivers generally appreciate the Spirit's reliability, fuel efficiency, and value for money. However, some common issues have been reported.

**Engine**
- **2.5L V6:**
    - **Intake Manifold Gasket Failure:** Intake manifold gaskets degrade over time, causing coolant and oil leaks. Symptoms include overheating, coolant loss, and poor engine performance. Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500
    - **Rear Main Seal Leak:** The rear main seal can fail, leading to oil leaks from the rear of the engine. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle and low oil levels. Solution: Replace the rear main seal. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $800
- **3.0L V6:**
    - **Head Gasket Failure:** Head gaskets can fail, allowing coolant and oil to leak into the cylinders. Symptoms include overheating, white or blue smoke from the exhaust, and poor engine performance. Solution: Replace the head gaskets. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    - **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure:** The timing chain tensioner can fail, causing the timing chain to slip and potentially damage the engine. Symptoms include a rattling noise from the engine, misfires, and poor performance. Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioner. Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1,000

**Transmission**
- **A604 4-Speed Automatic:**
    - **Solenoid Pack Failure:** Solenoids in the transmission can fail, causing shifting problems, slipping, and premature gear engagement. Symptoms include rough shifting, delayed shifts, and inability to shift gears. Solution: Replace the solenoid pack. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
    - **Torque Converter Failure:** The torque converter can fail, preventing the transmission from engaging and causing the vehicle to stall. Symptoms include slipping, shuddering, and stalling. Solution: Replace the torque converter. Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,000 - $1,500+
- **A606 4-Speed Automatic:**
    - **Overdrive Band Failure:** The overdrive band can fail, causing slipping in overdrive gear and a loss of power. Symptoms include delayed shifts into overdrive, slipping while cruising, and poor highway performance. Solution: Replace the overdrive band. Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500
    - **Valve Body Leaks:** The valve body can develop leaks, leading to shifting problems, fluid leaks, and premature failure. Symptoms include hard shifting, inconsistent shifting, and fluid leaking from the transmission pan. Solution: Repair or replace the valve body. Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,000
