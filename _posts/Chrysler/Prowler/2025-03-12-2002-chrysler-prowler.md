The 2002 Chrysler Prowler, the final year of production, is a unique retro-styled roadster that draws attention with its distinctive design. All Prowlers came standard with a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 253 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission with AutoStick. Many owners appreciate the Prowler for its head-turning aesthetics and fun driving experience, while some criticisms focus on its limited storage space, ride quality, and reliance on a V6 engine rather than a V8, which some felt was more appropriate for its hot rod styling.

**Engine**

**3.5L V6**

*   **Timing Chain Tensioner Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking or rattling noise coming from the engine, especially on startup. This noise is due to worn or failing timing chain tensioners, leading to slack in the timing chain. Left unaddressed, this can cause serious engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replace the timing chain tensioners, guides, and possibly the timing chain itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L V6 engine has been known for leaking coolant, often from the water pump, thermostat housing, or radiator hoses. This can lead to overheating if coolant levels drop too low. Visible coolant puddles under the vehicle, a sweet smell, or the engine overheating are signs of a leak.
    *   Solution: Identify and replace the source of the leak, which may involve replacing the water pump, thermostat housing, hoses, or the radiator itself.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location and severity of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (42LE)**

*   **Shifting Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or delayed shifts, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear. The transmission may also slip or fail to engage gears properly.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair or replace the transmission valve body, or perform a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $3000+ depending on the extent of the damage.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Torque Converter Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The torque converter on the 42LE transmissions is known to fail causing shuddering in gear or complete engine stall.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the torque converter is the most common remedy.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $600 - $1200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Bushing Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The bushings in the front suspension arms can wear out, leading to clunking noises, loose steering, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace worn bushings or, in some cases, the entire control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Headlight Switch Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Headlights malfunctioning, flickering, or not turning on at all. This is often due to a faulty headlight switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the headlight switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges may become inaccurate or stop working altogether. This is often due to a fault within the instrument cluster itself.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rear Window Defogger Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The rear window defogger lines become damaged, causing partial or complete failure of the defogger system.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the defogger system, which may involve specialized repair of the grid lines or replacement of the rear window.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Air Conditioning Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The air conditioning system may blow warm air or not function at all. This can be caused by leaks in the system, a faulty compressor, or other component failures.
    *   Solution: Diagnose and repair the A/C system, which may involve recharging the refrigerant, replacing the compressor, or repairing leaks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found
