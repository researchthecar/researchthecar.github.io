### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chrysler Prowler, while a niche vehicle, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and design. The 3.5L V6 engine can experience oil and cooling system leaks, and the 4-speed automatic transmission may develop shifting issues. Suspension components, particularly ball joints and rear leaf springs, are also noted areas for potential wear. Electrical gremlins can manifest in the instrument cluster and power window systems. Exterior fiberglass and headlight condition, along with interior seat wear and HVAC blower motor, are also points to consider. Proactive inspection and maintenance are recommended for owners to preserve the Prowler's unique appeal and performance.
