The 2004 Chrysler Voyager is a minivan that offers practicality and affordability. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 generating 180 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. All models used a 4-speed automatic transmission.
