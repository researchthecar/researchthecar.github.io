### Summary Verdict
The 2002 Chrysler Voyager, while offering practical space, exhibits common issues for its age, particularly concerning the engine (head gaskets on the 2.4L, oil leaks on all engines) and transmission (slipping and harsh shifting). Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and alternator failures are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear out, and exterior rust is a concern in certain regions. Interior climate control issues, specifically blend door actuators, are frequent. Despite these potential problems, many Voyagers can be maintained with regular servicing and addressing these known weak points.
