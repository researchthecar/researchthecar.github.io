The 2000 Chrysler Voyager is a minivan known for its spacious interior and comfortable ride, making it a popular choice for families. Engine options include a 2.4L Inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0L V6 making 150 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 that puts out 180 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. All engines are paired with a 3-speed or 4-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine. Many owners appreciate the Voyager's practicality and affordability. However, it is often criticized for its reliability issues, particularly concerning the transmission and electrical systems, and the overall build quality is not considered to be very high.
