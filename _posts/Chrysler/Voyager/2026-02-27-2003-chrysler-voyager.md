### Summary Verdict
The 2003 Chrysler Voyager, while a practical choice, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and class. Engine issues like head gasket failures on the 2.4L and intake manifold leaks on V6 models, along with transmission problems such as slipping and harsh shifting, are frequently reported. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Body Control Module and alternators, can also arise. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods, and interior elements such as HVAC actuators and instrument clusters, may require attention over time. Owners should be prepared for potential repairs related to these areas to maintain optimal performance and longevity of their vehicle.
