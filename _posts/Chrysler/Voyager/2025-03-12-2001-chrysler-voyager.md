The 2001 Chrysler Voyager is a minivan that offers practicality and versatility for families. It was available with two engine options: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 producing 180 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Voyager's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordable price point. However, common complaints include build quality issues, electrical problems, and a somewhat unrefined driving experience.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks, often originating from the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, or rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rough Idling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rough or erratic idling, sometimes accompanied by stalling, can be caused by a faulty idle air control (IAC) valve or a dirty throttle body.
