# 2006 Chrysler Voyager

### Overview
The 2006 Chrysler Voyager, a minivan known for its practicality and family-oriented features, presented a mixed bag in terms of long-term reliability. While generally offering a comfortable ride and ample space, certain model years and specific component groups experienced more frequent issues than others. Owners often reported concerns related to the powertrain, particularly with transmission performance and some engine-related problems. Electrical systems also showed some vulnerabilities, contributing to a less than stellar reliability record for some units. However, the exterior and interior components, while subject to normal wear, did not typically present widespread systemic failures. Understanding these common problem areas is crucial for potential buyers and current owners looking to maintain their Voyager.

### Summary Verdict
The 2006 Chrysler Voyager exhibits moderate reliability concerns, with the powertrain (engine and transmission) being the most frequent source of significant issues. Head gasket failures on the 2.4L engine and transmission slipping on the automatic gearbox are notable problems. Diesel variants can face turbocharger and glow plug issues. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the BCM and alternator, also require attention. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items that can lead to problems if neglected. While exterior and interior components are generally robust, the HVAC system's blend door actuators can fail. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are recommended to mitigate potential repair costs and ensure continued operation.
