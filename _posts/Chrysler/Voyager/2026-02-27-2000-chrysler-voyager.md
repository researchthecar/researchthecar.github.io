### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Chrysler Voyager, while a practical choice, exhibits common issues for its age and model line. Powertrain reliability can be a concern, with head gasket failures on the 2.4L engine and oil leaks across various engines being notable. Transmissions, particularly the automatic units, can suffer from slipping and overheating, often requiring significant repair. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are prone to wear, leading to steering and noise issues. Electrical problems, such as BCM failures and power window motor issues, are also reported. Exterior rust and interior wear, like dashboard cracking and HVAC blower motor failures, are also areas to monitor. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential problems are crucial for maintaining the Voyager's functionality.
