### Summary Verdict
The 2008 Chrysler Voyager exhibits a mixed reliability profile. While the core powertrain components like the V6 engines are generally robust, specific issues such as intake manifold leaks on the 3.3L and head gasket concerns on the 3.8L V6 have been noted. Diesel variants (2.8L CRD) are more prone to turbocharger and injector problems. Transmission issues, particularly with the automatic gearbox, including slipping and torque converter problems, are a recurring theme. Suspension components like ball joints and strut mounts require attention over time. Electrical gremlins, often linked to the BCM or alternator, can cause significant inconvenience. Exterior and interior components, such as sliding door mechanisms and power window regulators, also present common repair needs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for managing the reliability of this minivan.
