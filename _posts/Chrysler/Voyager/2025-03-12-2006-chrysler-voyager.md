The 2006 Chrysler Voyager is a minivan that offers a practical and spacious option for families. This model year offered two engine choices: a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.3L V6 generating 180 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Voyager for its affordability and cargo space, but common complaints include concerns about reliability and some outdated interior features.

**Engine**

**2.4L Inline-4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 2.4L engine consuming an excessive amount of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This can lead to engine damage if not monitored and addressed. Symptoms include low oil levels, blue smoke from the exhaust, and potential engine knocking.
    *   Solution: The root cause can vary, including worn piston rings, valve stem seals, or issues with the PCV valve. A compression test and leak-down test can help pinpoint the source. Replacement of the affected components is typically required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2000+ (depending on the cause and repair needed)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**

*   **EGR Valve Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The EGR valve, responsible for recirculating exhaust gases to reduce emissions, can become clogged or fail. Symptoms include a rough idle, stalling, poor acceleration, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Replacing the EGR valve is the common solution. Cleaning the EGR valve can be a temporary fix, but replacement is often recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engine Options)**

*   **Shift Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission may exhibit shift problems, including harsh shifting, slipping between gears, or failure to shift properly. This can be caused by worn-out solenoids, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: A transmission fluid flush and filter change might resolve minor issues. However, if the problem persists, further diagnosis is required, potentially leading to solenoid replacement, valve body repair, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (fluid/filter) - $3000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the struts and shocks can wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, reduced handling, and increased braking distances. Noises, such as clunking, may also be present.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks is the standard solution. It's often recommended to replace them in pairs (front or rear) for balanced performance.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (per pair)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Sliding Door Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors are known to develop issues, including failing to open or close properly, getting stuck, or making unusual noises. This can be due to problems with the motor, wiring harness, or latch mechanisms.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the specific cause is necessary. Solutions may include replacing the motor, repairing the wiring, or replacing the latch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ (depending on the component)
    *   Recalls: None Found
*   **Central Locking System Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Problems with the central locking system, such as doors not locking/unlocking or alarm activation.
    * Solution: Check fuses, wiring harness, and relays. Replace faulty parts as needed.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$400+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rocker Panels and Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Voyager is susceptible to rust, particularly on the rocker panels and around the wheel wells, especially in areas with harsh winters and road salt.
    *   Solution: Rust repair can range from surface treatment to welding in new metal panels. Early treatment is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ (depending on the severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Dashboard Cracking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The dashboard can be prone to cracking, especially in areas with high temperatures.
    *   Solution: There is no perfect fix for this beyond replacing the entire dashboard, which is very costly. Dashboard covers are a common workaround.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 (cover) - $1000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2006 Chrysler Voyager, while a practical minivan, faces several common issues. Engine problems such as excessive oil consumption (2.4L) and EGR valve failures (3.3L), transmission shift problems, and electrical issues with the power sliding doors are among the most frequently reported concerns. Suspension wear and tear and rust issues also contribute to the ownership experience. The cost of repairs can vary widely depending on the specific problem and its severity, but some issues can be quite expensive to resolve, potentially making it a less reliable used vehicle option compared to its competitors.
