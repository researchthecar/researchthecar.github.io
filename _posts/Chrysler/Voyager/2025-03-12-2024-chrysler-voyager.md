Here's a comprehensive breakdown of common issues and complaints reported for the 2024 Chrysler Voyager, formatted for your website.

The 2024 Chrysler Voyager is a budget-friendly minivan primarily geared towards fleet customers. It comes with a single engine option: a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 producing 287 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. While some appreciate its affordability and spaciousness, others find the Voyager lacking in features and refinement compared to higher-end minivans. Common dislikes include its limited trim levels and options, basic interior materials, and less advanced technology compared to competitors.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**
* **Engine Oil Cooler Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Coolant and/or oil leaks near the oil filter adapter housing or around the engine block. May also be a burning oil smell if the oil leaks onto the exhaust. Can cause overheating and engine damage if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: Replacement of the engine oil cooler and related gaskets/seals.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Faulty Rocker Arms**
    * Description/Symptoms: Ticking noise emanating from the engine, especially at idle or low speeds. Potential for misfires, reduced performance, and eventual engine damage if the rocker arms fail completely. This issue has been reported on various Pentastar V6 engines across multiple model years, potentially affecting the 2024 Voyager as well.
    * Solution: Replacement of the affected rocker arms and lifters. In some cases, the camshaft may also need replacement.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (948TE)**
* **Harsh Shifting/Slipping**
    * Description/Symptoms: Rough or jerky gear changes, especially between lower gears. Transmission may slip or hesitate during acceleration. In some cases, the transmission may fail to shift altogether.
    * Solution: Diagnosis may involve software updates to the transmission control module (TCM). In more severe cases, valve body replacement or complete transmission rebuild/replacement may be necessary.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (Software update) - $4000+ (Transmission replacement)
    * Recalls: None Found

* **Transmission Fluid Leaks**
    * Description/Symptoms: Puddles of red or brown fluid under the vehicle. May also notice difficulty shifting or transmission slipping. Leaks can occur from the transmission pan gasket, seals, or cooler lines.
    * Solution: Identify the source of the leak and replace the faulty component (gasket, seal, line). Check and refill the transmission fluid level.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+ depending on the source of the leak.
    * Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**
* **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    * Description/Symptoms: Clunking or rattling noises from the front or rear suspension, especially when driving over bumps. Uneven tire wear. Vehicle may feel unstable or "floaty" at higher speeds.
    * Solution: Inspection of suspension components (struts, shocks, control arms, bushings, ball joints, sway bar links). Replacement of worn or damaged parts.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+ per corner, depending on the parts needing replacement.
