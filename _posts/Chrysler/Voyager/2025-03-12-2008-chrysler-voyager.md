The 2008 Chrysler Voyager is a minivan known for its practicality and affordability. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 generating 175 horsepower and 205 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Voyager's spacious interior and comfortable ride. However, common complaints include unreliability, build quality, and relatively poor fuel economy compared to newer minivans.

**Engine**

**2.4L I4**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners report the 2.4L engine consuming excessive amounts of oil, requiring frequent top-offs between oil changes. This may be indicated by blue smoke from the exhaust, low oil pressure light, or engine knocking.
    *   Solution: Depending on the severity, solutions range from using a higher viscosity oil and monitoring levels closely to replacing piston rings or the entire engine.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Stalling**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported the vehicle randomly stalling while driving. This seems to happen most often while at low speeds or stopped.
    *   Solution: The throttle position sensor may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6**

*   **Rough Idle**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine exhibits a noticeably shaky or unstable idle, which may be more apparent when the vehicle is stationary. This can be caused by a vacuum leak, dirty throttle body, or a faulty sensor.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the root cause via a scan tool and addressing the specific issue. This could involve cleaning the throttle body, replacing a vacuum hose, or replacing a sensor such as the mass airflow (MAF) sensor or oxygen sensor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Abrupt and jerky gear changes during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: Transmission fluid change/flush, replacement of solenoids, or a transmission rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The engine revs up without a corresponding increase in vehicle speed, or the transmission struggles to engage a gear.
    *   Solution: Similar to harsh shifting, this may require a fluid change, solenoid replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild/replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts/Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncy ride, excessive body roll in turns, nose diving during braking, uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Control Arm Bushings**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front end, especially over bumps, loose steering.
    *   Solution: Replacement of control arm bushings or complete control arm assembly.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Power sliding doors malfunctioning, failing to open or close properly, or becoming stuck.
    * Solution: The power sliding door motor or the door rollers may need to be replaced.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1000+
    * Recalls: None Found

*   **TIPM (Totally Integrated Power Module) Failures**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Various electrical issues including fuel pump relay failure (leading to stalling or no-start conditions), erratic wiper operation, power window malfunctions, and horn issues.
    *   Solution: TIPM replacement or repair (if possible). Note: after market parts may be available at a cheaper price
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges not working, incorrect readings, or the entire cluster going blank.
    *   Solution: Instrument cluster repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Door Handles Breaking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The exterior door handles, particularly the sliding door handles, are prone to breaking, making it difficult or impossible to open the doors.

**Summary**

The 2008 Chrysler Voyager is a budget-friendly minivan that offers practicality, but it is prone to various issues that can lead to significant repair costs. The engine and transmission can suffer from oil consumption, rough idling, and shifting problems. The electrical system is also a weak point, with TIPM failures causing a range of issues. Suspension components wear out over time, affecting ride quality. Although the Voyager is affordable to purchase, potential owners should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs. The severity of the issues ranges from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, and the cost to fix them can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.
