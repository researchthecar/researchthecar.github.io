The 2005 Chrysler Voyager is a minivan known for its affordability and spaciousness. While it offers practicality, it's also known to have a fair share of issues. Engine options included a 2.4L inline-4 producing 150 hp and 165 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.3L V6 producing 180 hp and 210 lb-ft of torque. The 3.3L was generally preferred for its smoother power delivery and ability to handle a fully loaded van. Owners often appreciated the Voyager's comfortable ride and easy maneuverability, but fuel economy and reliability were common complaints.
