The 2020 Chrysler Voyager is a minivan offering practicality and value. This model year was offered exclusively with a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine, producing 287 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Voyager's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and affordability. Common criticisms include the relatively basic features compared to higher-end minivans, and some reported issues with the transmission.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Engine Misfires**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported engine misfires, particularly at higher mileage. This can manifest as rough idling, decreased power, and the check engine light illuminating. Diagnosis often points to faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty ignition coils, spark plugs, or fuel injectors. A thorough diagnostic scan should pinpoint the affected cylinder(s).
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $600+ depending on the number of parts being replaced and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leaks around the oil cooler adapter and valve cover gaskets have been reported. The leaks can be minor drips or more significant losses of oil, leading to low oil levels and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the oil cooler adapter and/or valve cover gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak and labor costs.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (948TE)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Hesitation**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Many owners have complained about rough or delayed shifting, especially between lower gears. The transmission may hesitate before engaging a gear, or shift abruptly. This can be more noticeable during acceleration or deceleration.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a software update/reflash of the transmission control module (TCM) can improve shifting performance. If the issue persists, valve body replacement or a full transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (for software update) - $4,000+ (for rebuild). Valve body replacement can be around $800 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Complete transmission failure, sometimes with little warning, has been reported, though less frequently than shifting issues. Symptoms include complete loss of drive, loud noises coming from the transmission, or the vehicle refusing to shift into any gear.
    *   Solution: Transmission replacement or a full rebuild.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $4,000 - $6,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of premature wear of struts, shocks, and sway bar links, leading to clunking noises, poor handling, and uneven tire wear. This seems to be more prevalent in vehicles used for frequent heavy loads or on rough roads.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn suspension components. A front end alignment after repairs is recommended.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ per corner, depending on the part needing replacement and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Uconnect System Freezing/Malfunctioning**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Issues with the Uconnect infotainment system, including freezing, slow response times, and the screen going blank. In some cases, the system may require a reset or software update to restore functionality.
    *   Solution: Performing a system reset, updating the Uconnect software, or replacing the Uconnect module.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (for reset/software update) - $500+ (for module replacement).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Sliding Door Problems**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power sliding doors sometimes fail to open or close properly, or the doors may make loud noises. This can be due to a faulty motor, sensor, or damaged track.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty motor, sensor, or repairing the track.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+, depending on the specific issue and parts needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

The 2020 Chrysler Voyager has reported issues that range in severity and cost. Transmission problems are a significant concern, potentially leading to expensive repairs. Electrical gremlins with the Uconnect system and sliding doors are also common complaints.
