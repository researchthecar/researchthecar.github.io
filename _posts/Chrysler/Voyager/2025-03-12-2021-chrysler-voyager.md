The 2021 Chrysler Voyager is a minivan offering a more budget-friendly option compared to the Chrysler Pacifica. It typically comes with a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 engine producing 287 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciate the Voyager's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and user-friendly infotainment system.
