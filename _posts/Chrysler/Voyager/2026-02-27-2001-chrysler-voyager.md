### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chrysler Voyager is a functional minivan that, while generally reliable for its age, exhibits some common issues. Powertrain components, particularly head gaskets on the 2.4L engines and intake manifold gaskets on V6s, along with transmission solenoid and torque converter problems, are notable concerns. Suspension wear, electrical gremlins related to the BCM and window motors, and exterior rust are also frequently reported. Interior wear, especially on seats, and HVAC blend door failures are common. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these potential issues can significantly extend the life and usability of the vehicle.
