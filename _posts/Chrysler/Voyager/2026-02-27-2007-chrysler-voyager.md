### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chrysler Voyager, while a practical choice, exhibits some common issues typical for vehicles of its age and segment. The diesel engine variants, particularly the 2.8L CRD, are more prone to specific problems like turbocharger and glow plug failures. Automatic transmission issues, such as slipping gears and torque converter problems, are also noted. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods can wear out, leading to steering and noise issues. Electrical gremlins, often related to the BCM or alternator, can cause various malfunctions. Exterior rust can be a concern in certain climates, and interior components like the HVAC blower resistor and dashboard trim are also areas to watch. Despite these potential issues, many Voyagers remain on the road with proper maintenance and timely repairs.
