The 2022 Chrysler Voyager is a budget-friendly minivan primarily aimed at fleet sales, but also available to individual consumers. It shares many components with the Chrysler Pacifica. The sole engine option is a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine producing 287 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the Voyager's spacious interior, comfortable ride, and value proposition. Common criticisms include a lack of features compared to higher-trim minivans, basic interior materials, and some concerns about long-term reliability.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Excessive Oil Consumption**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported higher than expected oil consumption. Symptoms include needing to add oil frequently between oil changes, low oil level warnings, and potentially blue smoke from the exhaust.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a faulty PCV valve can contribute to oil consumption. Replacement of the PCV valve may resolve the issue. Other potential causes can be attributed to damaged valve seals, piston rings, or issues with the cylinder walls.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: PCV valve replacement: $50 - $150. More extensive engine work is significantly more expensive, potentially ranging from $1,000 - $5,000+ depending on the needed repair.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**9-Speed Automatic (948TE)**

*   **Harsh or Erratic Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Reports of harsh shifts, especially between lower gears, are common. Some owners describe feeling a "clunk" or "jerk" during gear changes. Hesitation when accelerating is also reported.
    *   Solution: A software update to the Transmission Control Module (TCM) may resolve some shifting issues. In other cases, valve body replacement or transmission replacement may be required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: TCM software update: $100-$200. Valve body replacement: $800 - $1500+. Transmission replacement: $3000 - $6000+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported total transmission failure at relatively low mileage. Symptoms include the vehicle not moving when in drive, loud noises coming from the transmission, and error messages on the dashboard.
    *   Solution: Replacing the transmission is the most common fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $6000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Uconnect System Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The Uconnect infotainment system can experience various glitches, including freezing, slow response times, screen blackouts, Bluetooth connectivity problems, and navigation malfunctions.
    *   Solution: Try resetting the Uconnect system by holding down the power and volume buttons for 15 seconds. If the problem persists, a software update or replacement of the Uconnect module may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Software Update: $0 - $200 (if covered under warranty or recall, often free). Uconnect module replacement: $500 - $1500+.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Malfunction**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera may fail to display an image, show a distorted or blurry image, or have intermittent functionality.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows not functioning properly, including failing to open or close, moving slowly, or making unusual noises.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the window motor or regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2022 Chrysler Voyager presents a mixed bag of potential issues. While the engine itself seems relatively reliable (aside from the oil consumption reports), the transmission is a significant area of concern, with reports of harsh shifting and outright failures. Electrical glitches with the Uconnect system and backup camera also appear to be common. The severity of the issues ranges from minor annoyances to potentially expensive repairs. Buyers should be aware of the possibility of transmission problems and factor that into their purchasing decision, and ensure that the Uconnect system is functioning correctly.
