Here is a breakdown of common issues reported for the 2002 Chrysler Grand Voyager, categorized by component and engine/transmission options.

The 2002 Chrysler Grand Voyager is a popular minivan known for its spaciousness and practicality. Engine options included a 2.4L I4 producing around 150 horsepower and 165 lb-ft of torque, a 3.3L V6 generating approximately 180 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.8L V6 outputting about 215 horsepower and 245 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Voyager for its comfortable ride, cargo capacity, and features like Stow 'n Go seating (on some models). Common dislikes included reliability issues, particularly with the transmission and electrical systems, as well as a somewhat dated design.

    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.3L V6 Engine**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Similar to the 2.4L, oil leaks commonly occur around the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80-$250+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Coolant Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks are frequently observed at the water pump, radiator hoses, or intake manifold gasket. This can lead to overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump, radiator hoses, or intake manifold gasket.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $500+, depending on the source of the leak and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.8L V6 Engine**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine shares the same oil leak tendencies as the other engines, commonly found at the valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and rear main seal.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gasket or seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $80-$250+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Overheating**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine is prone to overheating if the cooling system is not properly maintained. Issues include a clogged radiator, faulty thermostat, or failing water pump.
    *   Solution: Flush the cooling system, replace the thermostat, or replace the water pump.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $75 - $500+, depending on the failed component.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic Transmission (All Engines)**

*   **Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can develop harsh shifting, particularly between 1st and 2nd gear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the solenoid pack can solve the problem. A complete transmission rebuild may also be needed to restore the transmission to factory spec.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $250 - $1500+ depending on the severity and repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Transmission Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Slipping between gears is another common problem, often accompanied by a loss of power and increased engine RPM without a corresponding increase in speed.
    *   Solution: A transmission rebuild is often necessary to correct slipping.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $3000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Worn Struts and Shocks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Over time, the struts and shocks wear out, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ for parts and labor.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Sway Bar Bushings and End Links**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Worn sway bar bushings and end links can cause clunking noises, especially when going over bumps or turning.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn bushings and end links.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $200+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Door Lock Issues**

**Summary**

The 2002 Chrysler Grand Voyager is prone to several common issues, primarily related to the engine, transmission, electrical system, and suspension. Oil and coolant leaks are frequent engine concerns, while the 4-speed automatic transmission often experiences harsh shifting and slipping. Electrical issues like power door lock and window motor failures are also common. Suspension components wear out over time, affecting ride quality and handling. The severity and cost of these repairs can vary widely, with some issues being relatively inexpensive to fix while others, like transmission rebuilds, can be quite costly. The most significant and expensive repairs are related to engine and transmission problems, so it's crucial to have a mechanic inspect these areas.
