**Introduction to the 1996 Chrysler Grand Voyager:**

The 1996 Chrysler Grand Voyager, part of the second generation of the popular minivan, was available with a variety of engine and transmission options. The base engine was a 3.3-liter V6 that produced 158 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. A more powerful 3.8-liter V6 that produced 166 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque was optional. Both engines were mated to a four-speed automatic transmission.

The symptoms include a rough idle, hesitation during acceleration, and increased fuel consumption. The solution is to replace the intake manifold gasket. The estimated cost of the repair is $300 to $500.
- **PCV valve failure:** The PCV valve could fail, causing a buildup of pressure in the crankcase. The symptoms include a rough idle, oil leaks, and increased emissions. The solution is to replace the PCV valve. The estimated cost of the repair is $50 to $100.

**3.8L V6**
- **Head gasket failure:** The head gasket could fail, causing a loss of coolant and a decrease in engine power. The symptoms include overheating, a white or milky substance in the oil, and a loss of coolant. The solution is to replace the head gasket. The estimated cost of the repair is $1,000 to $2,000.
- **Timing belt failure:** The timing belt could fail, causing the engine to lose power and stall.

The estimated cost of the repair is $500 to $1,000.

**Transmission**

**Four-Speed Automatic**
- **Transmission slipping:** The transmission could slip, causing a loss of power and acceleration. The symptoms include a lack of response when shifting gears, a whining or grinding noise from the transmission, and a check engine light. The solution is to rebuild or replace the transmission. The estimated cost of the repair is $1,500 to $3,000.
- **Solenoid failure:** The transmission solenoids could fail, causing a loss of power and acceleration.

The estimated cost of the repair is $500 to $1,000.

**Suspension**

- **Strut failure:** The struts could fail, causing a loss of stability and control. The symptoms include a rough ride, uneven tire wear, and a decrease in handling. The solution is to replace the struts. The estimated cost of the repair is $500 to $1,000.
- **Ball joint failure:** The ball joints could fail, causing a loss of control and stability. The symptoms include a clunking noise when turning, a loose steering wheel, and uneven tire wear. The solution is to replace the ball joints. The estimated cost of the repair is $200 to $400.

**Electrical**

- **Alternator failure:** The alternator could fail, causing a loss of electrical power. The symptoms include a dim or flickering dashboard, a loss of power to the headlights and other electrical components, and a dead battery. The solution is to replace the alternator. The estimated cost of the repair is $500 to $1,000.
- **Starter failure:** The starter could fail, causing the engine to not start. The symptoms include a clicking noise when turning the key, a lack of response from the engine, and a dead battery. The solution is to replace the starter. The estimated cost of the repair is $200 to $400.

**Exterior**

- **Rust:** The body of the vehicle could rust, causing a loss of structural integrity and a decrease in value. The symptoms include bubbling paint, rust spots, and holes in the body. The solution is to repair or replace the rusted parts. The estimated cost of the repair varies depending on the extent of the damage.
- **Window regulator failure:** The window regulators could fail, causing the windows to become stuck or to fall down. The symptoms include a lack of response when operating the windows, a rattling noise from the windows, and a loose or broken window. The solution is to replace the window regulators. The estimated cost of the repair is $200 to $400 per window.

**Interior**

- **Climate control failure:** The climate control system could fail, causing a lack of heating or cooling. The symptoms include a lack of response from the climate controls, a lack of airflow from the vents, and a decrease in temperature. The solution is to repair or replace the climate control system. The estimated cost of the repair varies depending on the extent of the damage.
- **Power seat failure:** The power seats could fail, causing a loss of adjustment and comfort. The symptoms include a lack of response from the seat controls, a loose or broken seat, and a lack of support. The solution is to repair or replace the power seats.
