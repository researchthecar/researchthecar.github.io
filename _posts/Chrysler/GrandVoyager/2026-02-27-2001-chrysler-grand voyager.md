### Summary Verdict
The 2001 Chrysler Grand Voyager can be a practical choice for families, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. Engine reliability, particularly with the 2.4L and 3.8L engines, can be compromised by head gasket failures and oil leaks. The automatic transmission, while generally functional, is prone to torque converter and solenoid problems. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, such as faulty power window motors and instrument clusters, are also frequently reported. Exterior rust, especially in harsh climates, and interior issues like sagging headliners can detract from the vehicle's appeal. Thorough pre-purchase inspection and budgeting for potential repairs are highly recommended.
