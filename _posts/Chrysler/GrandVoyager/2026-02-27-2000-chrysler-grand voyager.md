### Summary Verdict
The 2000 Chrysler Grand Voyager offers a spacious and versatile package for families, but potential buyers should be aware of common reliability concerns. The engines, particularly the V6 options, can be prone to head gasket and intake manifold leaks. Automatic transmissions may develop issues like slipping or overheating, often requiring significant repair costs. Suspension components like ball joints and springs can wear out, leading to noise and handling problems. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the BCM and power accessories, are also frequently reported. Exterior rust can be an issue on older models, and interior components like the HVAC blower motor may fail. Despite these potential drawbacks, many Grand Voyagers have provided reliable service with diligent maintenance and timely repairs of known issues.
