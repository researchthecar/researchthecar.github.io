**Introduction**

The 1993 Chrysler Grand Voyager was a popular minivan that offered a spacious interior, comfortable ride, and a variety of engine and transmission options. It was available with a 3.0L V6 engine producing 150 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque, mated to a 3-speed automatic transmission; or a 3.3L V6 engine producing 162 horsepower and 212 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Grand Voyager was praised for its roomy cabin, smooth handling, and versatile seating configurations, but it was also criticized for its lack of power, especially when equipped with the smaller 3.0L engine.
