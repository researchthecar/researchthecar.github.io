    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets or seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ depending on the location of the leak and the shop rates.

* **Sludge Buildup**
    * Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L engine can be prone to sludge buildup if oil changes are not performed regularly, or are performed with low-quality oil.
    * Solution: Perform regular oil changes with high-quality oil, or perform an engine flush. Major sludge buildup may require more extensive engine cleaning or even engine replacement.

    *   Solution: Replace the torque converter. In some cases, a transmission rebuild may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $2000+

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut/Rear Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises, poor handling, and excessive bouncing.
    *   Solution: Replace worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ per axle, depending on parts and labor.

*   **Sway Bar Link Wear**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises, especially when going over bumps or turning.
