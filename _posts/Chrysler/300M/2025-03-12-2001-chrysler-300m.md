The 2001 Chrysler 300M is a full-size, front-wheel-drive sedan known for its sleek styling and relatively sporty handling for its class. All 2001 Chrysler 300M models came equipped with a 3.5-liter 24-valve V6 engine, producing 253 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. The sole transmission option was a 4-speed automatic transmission (42LE). People often appreciate the 300M for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and distinctive design. Common dislikes include some reliability issues and relatively poor fuel economy compared to more modern cars.

**Engine**

**3.5L 24-Valve V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Plenum Gasket Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A common issue is failure of the intake manifold plenum gasket, leading to vacuum leaks. Symptoms include rough idling, poor fuel economy, and a possible check engine light (CEL) with codes related to lean conditions (e.g., P0171, P0174).
    *   Solution: Replacing the intake manifold plenum gasket resolves the vacuum leak.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Timing Belt Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L V6 utilizes a timing belt. If not replaced at the recommended interval (around 100,000 miles), the timing belt can fail, leading to significant engine damage. Symptoms include engine stalling, misfires, and complete engine failure if the belt snaps.
    *   Solution: Replacing the timing belt at the recommended interval. If the belt breaks, the engine may need extensive repair or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400-$800 for preventative replacement. $1500+ for engine repair after failure.
    *   Recalls: None Found

* **Crankshaft Position Sensor Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: The crankshaft position sensor is prone to failure. Symptoms include the engine stalling or refusing to start. A check engine light may be illuminated.
    * Solution: Replacing the crankshaft position sensor.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $250
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (42LE)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Harsh Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 42LE transmission can experience slipping between gears, harsh shifting, and delayed engagement. This can be caused by worn valve body components, low fluid level, or internal damage to the clutches and bands.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the cause is critical. A fluid flush and filter change *may* help in minor cases. More severe cases may require valve body replacement, a transmission rebuild, or a complete transmission replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100-$200 for fluid and filter, $500-$1000+ for valve body, $1500-$3000+ for rebuild/replacement.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shocks can wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll in corners.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn struts and shocks.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor).
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Control Arm Bushing Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The control arm bushings can deteriorate, causing clunking noises, especially over bumps, and play in the steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the worn control arm bushings or the entire control arm.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power window regulators are known to fail, causing the windows to be inoperable or slow to move.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $400+ per window.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Gauges in the instrument cluster may malfunction or become inaccurate. Sometimes the entire cluster can fail.
    *   Solution: Repair or replacement of the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ depending on the issue.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust (Especially in Northern Climates)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the undercarriage, rocker panels, and around wheel wells, particularly in areas where road salt is used.
    *   Solution: Rust repair or panel replacement. Prevention with rustproofing treatments can help slow the spread.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: Varies greatly depending on the extent of the rust. $200 - $1000+ per area.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Climate Control Malfunctions**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The climate control system can experience issues such as failing blend door actuators (causing temperature inconsistencies) and blower motor resistor failures (leading to only one fan speed working or no fan at all).
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty blend door actuator or blower motor resistor.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2001 Chrysler 300M has several common issues, ranging from relatively minor electrical problems to more serious engine and transmission concerns. Engine issues like timing belt failure and intake manifold leaks are significant. Transmission issues such as slipping and harsh shifting are common. Suspension components are also prone to wear. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, others can be costly, making it important to inspect a used 300M thoroughly before purchase and be prepared for potential maintenance.
