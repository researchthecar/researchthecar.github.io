The 2009 Chrysler Aspen is a full-size SUV that aimed to blend truck-like capability with some level of luxury. Engine options included a 4.7L V8 producing 303 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L Hemi V8 producing 355 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciated the Aspen's towing capacity and spacious interior, but disliked its fuel economy and some aspects of its reliability.

**Summary**

The 2009 Chrysler Aspen, while offering good towing capacity and interior space, is prone to a variety of issues. Engine problems, especially the "Hemi tick" and oil consumption in the 5.7L, can be expensive to fix. Electrical issues with the TIPM can cause a multitude of problems. Suspension and transmission problems are also relatively common. Overall, potential buyers should be aware of these potential issues and factor in repair costs when considering purchasing a 2009 Aspen. The severity ranges from minor electrical glitches to major engine and transmission repairs, with costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.
