The 2008 Chrysler Aspen is a full-size SUV that offers a blend of truck-like capability and passenger comfort. Engine options included a 4.7L V8 producing 235 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque, and a 5.7L HEMI V8 delivering 335 hp and 370 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners generally appreciated the Aspen's spacious interior and towing capacity, but common complaints revolved around fuel economy and reliability issues.

**Engine**

**4.7L V8**

*   **Valve Train Noise/Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ticking or knocking noise coming from the engine, especially at idle or low speeds. Often attributed to worn or damaged hydraulic lash adjusters (lifters).
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected hydraulic lash adjusters.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolts Breaking**
    * Description/Symptoms: Exhaust leak noise, decreased fuel economy, and potential for exhaust fumes entering the cabin.
    * Solution: Replacement of broken exhaust manifold bolts and potentially the exhaust manifold itself if warped or damaged.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **HEMI Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A distinct ticking noise emanating from the engine, particularly noticeable at idle and low speeds. This is often caused by excessive clearance in the valve train, typically related to the lifters or exhaust manifold bolts.
    *   Solution: Inspect exhaust manifold bolts for breakage or leakage and replace. For lifter issues, replacement of the affected lifters and possibly the camshaft.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1500+

**Summary**

The 2008 Chrysler Aspen presents a mixed bag. While it offers the space and capability of a full-size SUV, it is prone to several issues. Engine problems, particularly with the HEMI's "tick" and potential oil consumption, can be costly. Electrical gremlins stemming from the TIPM are also a concern. Suspension and interior issues are also prevalent. Potential buyers should be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repair costs when considering this vehicle.
