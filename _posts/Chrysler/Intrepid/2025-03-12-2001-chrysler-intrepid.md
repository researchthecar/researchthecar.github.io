The 2001 Chrysler Intrepid was a full-size, front-wheel-drive sedan known for its spacious interior and distinctive styling. Available engine options included a 2.7L V6, a 3.2L V6, and a 3.5L V6. The 3.5L V6 engine produces around 242 horsepower and 234 lb-ft of torque. It was offered with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Intrepid for its roomy cabin, comfortable ride, and relatively affordable price. Dislikes often centered around its reliability issues and somewhat lackluster fuel economy.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil sludge formation in the engine, leading to oil starvation, potential engine knocking, and ultimately engine failure. This is exacerbated by infrequent oil changes or use of incorrect oil.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil. Some may try engine flushing, but it's not always effective. In severe cases, engine replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump, often driven by the timing chain, is prone to failure. Symptoms include overheating, coolant leaks, and a whining noise from the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump and timing chain as a preventative measure as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

No Issues Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Intake Manifold Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Coolant leaks from the intake manifold gaskets, leading to coolant loss and potential overheating.
    *   Solution: Replace the intake manifold gaskets.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

    *   Solution: Replacing the solenoid pack, rebuilding the transmission, or replacing the transmission.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $500 (solenoid pack), $1,500 - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Bouncing, excessive body roll, and poor handling. Leaking fluid from the struts/shocks is a visual indicator.

**Summary**

The 2001 Chrysler Intrepid can be a comfortable and spacious sedan, but it's plagued by a number of reliability issues. The most significant concern is the potential for engine sludge, particularly in the 2.7L V6. Transmission problems and electrical gremlins are also common. Repair costs can range from relatively minor to very expensive, depending on the specific issue. Due to the age of these vehicles, finding well-maintained examples is crucial, and a pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic is highly recommended.
