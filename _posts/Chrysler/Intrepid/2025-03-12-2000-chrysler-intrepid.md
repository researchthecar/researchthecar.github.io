The 2000 Chrysler Intrepid was a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior and sleek design. Available engine options included a 2.7L V6 (200 hp, 190 lb-ft of torque) and a 3.2L V6 (225 hp, 235 lb-ft of torque). Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. People generally liked the Intrepid's comfortable ride and ample passenger room, but common complaints included reliability issues and build quality concerns.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Engine Sludge**
    *   Description/Symptoms: This engine is prone to oil sludge buildup due to its design. Symptoms include poor engine performance, engine knocking, overheating, and eventually, engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and shorter intervals can help prevent sludge. Once sludge has formed, engine cleaning or replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 (cleaning) - $3000+ (replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump is located inside the engine, driven by the timing chain. If the water pump fails it can cause the engine to overheat and cause damage to the engine.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump which requires extensive engine disassembly. It is recommended to replace the timing chain at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1500 - $2500
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2000 Chrysler Intrepid, while spacious and comfortable, is prone to several reliability issues, especially with the 2.7L V6 engine. Sludge build-up and water pump failure can be costly to repair. Transmission problems are also common. Electrical issues and interior wear (headliner sag) add to the ownership experience. Potential buyers should be aware of these issues and factor in potential repair costs when considering this vehicle. The most severe issue is engine sludge, as it can lead to complete engine failure. While other issues are less severe, the cost of repairs across the board can add up.
