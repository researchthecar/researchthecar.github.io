The 2004 Chrysler Intrepid is a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. It came with three engine options: a 2.7L V6 producing 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, a 3.2L V6 producing 225 horsepower and 235 lb-ft of torque, and a 3.5L V6 producing 250 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. All engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Intrepid for its roomy cabin and smooth highway performance. Common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with certain engine configurations, and some electrical gremlins.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**
*   **Sludge Buildup and Engine Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive oil sludge accumulation within the engine, often leading to oil starvation and catastrophic engine failure. Symptoms include knocking noises, overheating, and oil pressure warning lights. This is largely due to the design of the oil pan and the small oil passages.
    *   Solution: Regular and frequent oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil are crucial. Some owners have had success with installing an auxiliary oil cooler. Complete engine replacement is often required if the issue is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3,000 - $5,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump is located within the engine and driven by the timing chain. When the water pump fails, it will cause coolant loss, overheating, and potential engine damage.
    *   Solution: Replacing the water pump can be a difficult and involved process due to its location, which will require removal of the timing chain.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,200 - $2,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.2L V6**

No Issues Found

**3.5L V6**

No Issues Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (All Engines)**

*   **Shifting Problems / Transmission Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Erratic shifting, slipping between gears, harsh shifting, or complete transmission failure. This can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or internal damage.
    *   Solution: In some cases, a transmission flush and filter change may resolve minor issues. However, more often than not, a transmission rebuild or replacement is necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,800 - $3,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Strut Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Clunking noises from the front suspension, excessive bouncing, and poor handling. Worn struts can also lead to uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replacing the front struts is the most common repair. It is recommended to replace both struts at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $400 - $800
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Rear Shock Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Excessive bouncing from the rear, poor ride quality, and reduced handling stability.
    *   Solution: Replacing the rear shocks is the standard fix.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200-$400
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Malfunctioning gauges (speedometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge), flickering lights, or complete failure of the instrument cluster.
    *   Solution: Sometimes, resoldering connections on the circuit board can fix the problem. Otherwise, replacement or refurbishment of the instrument cluster is required.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Power Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Power windows failing to operate, making grinding noises, or moving slowly.
    *   Solution: Replacing the power window regulator is the standard repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Door Lock Actuator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Door locks failing to lock or unlock remotely or manually.
    *   Solution: Replacing the faulty door lock actuator will fix the issue.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150-$300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Rear Quarter Panels**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust developing on the lower rear quarter panels, especially around the wheel wells. This is a common issue in areas with road salt use.
    *   Solution: Rust repair involves removing the rust, patching any holes, and repainting the affected area.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,500+ per panel (depending on severity)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner material detaching from the roof, causing it to sag or droop.
    *   Solution: Replacing the headliner material, which involves removing the old headliner and installing a new one.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2004 Chrysler Intrepid, while offering a comfortable and spacious ride, is prone to certain reliability issues. The most significant concern is the potential for engine failure in the 2.7L V6 due to sludge buildup, which can be very costly to repair. Other common issues include transmission problems, suspension wear, and electrical glitches. While some repairs are relatively inexpensive, the potential for major engine or transmission work should be a key consideration for prospective buyers. Overall, the cost of ownership can be high if these issues are not addressed proactively.
