## Engine

### 2.7L V6
**Head Gasket Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Coolant loss, white smoke from exhaust, engine overheating, milky oil.
- **Solution:** Replacement of head gaskets and associated seals. May require cylinder head machining.
- **Cost:** $1500 - $2500

**Oil Sludge Buildup**
- **Symptoms:** Reduced engine performance, increased oil consumption, potential for bearing damage.
- **Solution:** Regular oil changes with high-quality oil and frequent flushing. In severe cases, engine disassembly and cleaning may be necessary.
- **Cost:** $300 - $800 (for flushing and oil change), significantly more for engine rebuild.


### 3.2L V6

- **Symptoms:** N/A
- **Solution:** N/A
- **Cost:** Varies


## Transmission

### 42LE Automatic Transmission
**Slipping Gears**
- **Symptoms:** Delayed engagement, harsh shifting, loss of power during acceleration.
- **Solution:** Transmission fluid and filter change, solenoid replacement, or full transmission rebuild.
- **Cost:** $500 - $2500+

**Overheating**
- **Symptoms:** Transmission fluid smells burnt, erratic shifting, potential for transmission failure.
- **Solution:** Check and top off transmission fluid, flush and replace fluid, inspect transmission cooler for blockages.
- **Cost:** $200 - $600


## Suspension

### Standard Chassis
**Worn Ball Joints and Tie Rod Ends**
- **Symptoms:** Clunking noises over bumps, vague steering, uneven tire wear.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
- **Cost:** $400 - $800

**Leaking Struts/Shocks**
- **Symptoms:** Bouncy ride, reduced handling, visible fluid leaks on shock/strut bodies.
- **Solution:** Replacement of worn struts or shocks.
- **Cost:** $300 - $700


## Electrical

### Body Control Module (BCM)
**Intermittent Electrical Failures**
- **Symptoms:** Malfunctioning power windows, door locks, interior lights, or instrument cluster issues.
- **Solution:** Diagnosis and potential reprogramming or replacement of the BCM.
- **Cost:** $500 - $1200


### Alternator
**Premature Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Dimming headlights, battery warning light, difficulty starting.
- **Solution:** Replacement of the alternator.
- **Cost:** $400 - $700


## Exterior

### Body Panels and Paint
**Clear Coat Peeling**
- **Symptoms:** Fading paint, peeling clear coat, especially on horizontal surfaces.

### Summary Verdict
The 2004 Chrysler Intrepid presents a mixed reliability profile. The 2.7L V6 engine is a notable weak point, prone to head gasket issues and oil sludge, requiring diligent maintenance and potentially costly repairs. The automatic transmission can also develop issues like slipping or overheating. Suspension components like ball joints and tie rods are common wear items. Electrical gremlins, particularly related to the Body Control Module, can cause frustrating intermittent problems. Exterior paint can suffer from clear coat degradation, and interior components like HVAC blend doors and power window regulators are also known to fail. While the 3.2L and 3.5L V6 engines are generally more robust, potential buyers should be aware of these common issues and factor in potential repair costs.
