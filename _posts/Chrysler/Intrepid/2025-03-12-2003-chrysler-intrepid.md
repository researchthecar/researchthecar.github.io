The 2003 Chrysler Intrepid was a full-size sedan known for its spacious interior, comfortable ride, and distinctive styling. It was available with two engine options: a 2.7L V6 producing approximately 200 horsepower and 190 lb-ft of torque, and a more powerful 3.5L V6 generating around 244 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. Both engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praised the Intrepid's interior space and trunk capacity, making it a practical choice for families. Common complaints revolved around reliability issues, particularly with the 2.7L engine, as well as some electrical and suspension problems.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Engine Sludge/Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L engine is known for developing sludge in the oil passages due to a poor oiling design and lack of proper maintenance. This sludge can lead to overheating, oil starvation, and ultimately engine failure. Symptoms include engine knocking, low oil pressure, overheating, and a check engine light.
    *   Solution: Regularly change the oil with high-quality synthetic oil and use a shorter oil change interval (3,000-5,000 miles). In severe cases, the engine may need to be replaced or rebuilt.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $3000 - $5000+ (Engine replacement or rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Water Pump Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The water pump is located inside the engine, driven by the timing chain. When it fails, it can leak coolant into the engine oil, leading to engine damage. Symptoms include overheating, coolant loss, and milky-colored oil.
    *   Solution: Replace the water pump, timing chain, and perform an oil change.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1000 - $2000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   **Oil Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 3.5L V6 can develop oil leaks from various locations, including valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, and crankshaft seals. Symptoms include oil spots under the vehicle and a burning oil smell.
    *   Solution: Replace the leaking gaskets and seals.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $800+ depending on the location of the leak.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (Both Engines)**

*   **Transmission Slipping/Hard Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 4-speed automatic transmission can experience slipping between gears, hard or delayed shifting, and a general lack of responsiveness. This can be caused by worn-out clutches, a faulty valve body, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Perform a transmission fluid flush (if the condition is not severe). Replace the valve body or rebuild/replace the transmission if the issue persists.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 - $300+ (Fluid flush); $800 - $3000+ (Valve body/Rebuild/Replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Strut/Shock Absorber Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The struts and shock absorbers can wear out over time, leading to a bouncy ride, poor handling, and excessive body roll.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn struts and shock absorbers.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $800+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Worn Ball Joints/Tie Rod Ends**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Ball joints and tie rod ends can wear out, causing loose steering, clunking noises, and uneven tire wear.
    *   Solution: Replace the worn ball joints and tie rod ends.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on parts and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Power Window Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The power windows can stop working due to a faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Solution: Replace the faulty window motor, regulator, or switch.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $400+ (depending on the component and labor)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Instrument Cluster Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The instrument cluster can experience intermittent failures, such as the speedometer or other gauges not working properly.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the instrument cluster.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $600+ (depending on the repair or replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust can develop on the rocker panels, quarter panels, and other areas of the vehicle, especially in regions with harsh winters.
    *   Solution: Repair or replace the rusted panels.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1000+ per panel (depending on the extent of the rust)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Headliner Sagging**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The headliner can sag and detach from the roof due to deterioration of the adhesive.
    *   Solution: Replace the headliner.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $500+ (depending on the shop)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2003 Chrysler Intrepid can be an affordable and comfortable car, but potential buyers should be aware of the common issues. The 2.7L engine is prone to sludge and failure, which can be a costly repair. Other issues, such as transmission problems, suspension wear, and electrical glitches, can also contribute to the overall cost of ownership. Pre-purchase inspections are highly recommended, and focusing on models with the 3.5L engine with documented maintenance can help mitigate some risks. Overall, the severity of these issues can range from minor inconveniences to major mechanical failures, with repair costs varying accordingly.
