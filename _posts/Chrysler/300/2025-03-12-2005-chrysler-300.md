The 2005 Chrysler 300 marked a return to rear-wheel-drive full-size sedans for Chrysler, offering bold styling and a comfortable ride. Available engine options included a 2.7L V6 (200 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque), a 3.5L V6 (250 hp and 250 lb-ft of torque), and a 5.7L HEMI V8 (340 hp and 390 lb-ft of torque). The 2.7L engine was paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 3.5L and 5.7L engines used a 5-speed automatic. Owners praised the 300's distinctive look, spacious interior, and powerful V8 option. Common complaints included some reliability issues, especially with electrical components, and fuel economy, especially with the HEMI engine.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Engine Sludge Build-up**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 engine is prone to sludge build-up if oil changes are not performed regularly and with the correct oil. Symptoms include rough idling, decreased performance, and potential engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality synthetic oil and potentially an engine flush. In severe cases, engine replacement may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 (oil change) to $3,000+ (engine replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

*   No Issues Found

**5.7L HEMI V8**

*   **HEMI Tick**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A ticking noise, especially at idle, that comes from the engine bay. This is often related to the MDS (Multi-Displacement System) lifters or exhaust manifold leaks.
    *   Solution: Depending on the cause, solutions can range from replacing exhaust manifold bolts to replacing the lifters, or even replacing the camshaft in severe cases.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+ depending on the repair needed.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**4-Speed Automatic (2.7L V6)**

*   No Issues Found

**5-Speed Automatic (3.5L V6 & 5.7L HEMI V8)**

*   **Torque Converter Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Shuddering during acceleration or cruise, especially at lower speeds. Can also manifest as harsh shifting.
    *   Solution: Replacing the torque converter. Flushing the transmission is recommended along with the repair.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $800 - $1,500+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Suspension**

*   **Front Suspension Ball Joint Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Knocking or clunking noise from the front end, especially when going over bumps or turning. Excessive play in the steering.
    *   Solution: Replacing the lower ball joints. It is recommended to replace both front ball joints at the same time.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Electrical**

*   **Total Integrated Power Module (TIPM) Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A wide range of electrical problems, including stalling, non-starting, erratic wiper operation, horn malfunction, and fuel pump issues.
    *   Solution: Replacing the TIPM. Some owners have had success with repairing specific relays within the TIPM, but replacement is the more common solution.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $1,200+ (for replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found. However, this was a recurring issue that led to recalls on later Chrysler models.

*   **Window Regulator Failure**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Windows failing to operate, often accompanied by a grinding noise.
    *   Solution: Replacing the window regulator.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $400 per window
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Exterior**

*   **Rust on Lower Door Panels/Wheel Wells**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Rust formation on the lower sections of the doors and around the wheel wells, especially in regions with salt usage on roads.
    *   Solution: Rust repair, panel replacement or patching, and repainting.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $1,000+ depending on severity.
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Interior**

*   **Sunroof Leaks**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Water leaking into the cabin, typically from the headliner around the sunroof.
    *   Solution: Cleaning the sunroof drain tubes and potentially replacing the sunroof seal.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $50 - $300
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Summary**

The 2005 Chrysler 300 has a mix of potential issues that prospective buyers should be aware of. The most concerning problems involve the TIPM, which can cause a multitude of electrical issues, and the 2.7L engine, which is prone to sludge. The HEMI V8 can experience the "HEMI tick," which while usually not catastrophic can be concerning. Suspension components and transmission issues are also common failure points. Depending on the specific issue and engine/transmission configuration, repairs can range from relatively inexpensive to potentially costly, especially if engine or transmission replacement is required.
