### Summary Verdict
The 2005 Chrysler 300, while offering a compelling package, exhibits some common reliability concerns typical for its age and class. Engine issues, particularly oil leaks across all variants and specific problems like timing chain wear on the 3.5L and cylinder deactivation faults on the 5.7L HEMI, are notable. The automatic transmission can also develop shifting problems and torque converter issues. Suspension components like ball joints and struts may require replacement due to wear. Electrical gremlins, often stemming from the BCM or alternator, are also reported. Exterior paint and interior comfort features like HVAC and seat heaters can also be sources of repair. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to early symptoms are crucial for mitigating these potential issues.
