### Summary Verdict
The 2013 Chrysler 300 offers a compelling package for those seeking a large, comfortable sedan. While its V6 and V8 engines are generally robust, owners have reported some specific issues, notably with intake manifold and oil cooler leaks on the 3.6L Pentastar, and occasional fuel injector problems on the 5.7L HEMI. The 8-speed automatic transmission can sometimes exhibit harsh shifting, often rectifiable with software updates or fluid services. Electrical gremlins, particularly with the Uconnect system and potential battery drain, are also noted. The suspension, exterior, and interior components are largely free from widespread significant problems. Overall, the 2013 300 is a decent choice, but prospective buyers should be mindful of these potential repair areas and ensure thorough pre-purchase inspections.
