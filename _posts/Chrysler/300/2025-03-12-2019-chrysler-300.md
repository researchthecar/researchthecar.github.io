The 2019 Chrysler 300 is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and stylish design. It offers a blend of luxury and performance at a relatively accessible price point. Engine options include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (or 300 hp and 264 lb-ft in the 300S) and a 5.7L Hemi V8 delivering 363 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often appreciate the 300's smooth ride, quiet cabin, and distinctive styling. Some common dislikes include the dated infotainment system compared to competitors and fuel economy that isn't the best, especially with the V8 engine.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Tick Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported a ticking noise coming from the engine, particularly at idle or low speeds. This can be due to a variety of engine components.
    *   Solution: Diagnosing the source of the tick noise may involve checking the engine oil level and pressure, inspecting the valve train components (such as lifters, rocker arms, and valve springs), and examining the exhaust manifold for leaks. Replacement of the affected components may be necessary.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $1,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick Noise**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A noticeable ticking or tapping sound, typically heard at idle or low engine speeds. Often attributed to the Multi-Displacement System (MDS) lifters, though other valve train components can be responsible.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis typically involves listening to the engine with a stethoscope to pinpoint the source of the noise. If MDS lifters are the issue, replacing them, along with the camshaft, is the common solution. Some owners opt to disable the MDS system as well.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**8-Speed Automatic (All Engine Options)**

*   **Harsh Shifting/Jerking**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Some owners have reported experiencing harsh or jerky shifts, particularly during acceleration or deceleration. This can be more pronounced in certain gear ranges.
    *   Solution: Check the transmission fluid level and condition, then consider a transmission fluid flush if the fluid is dirty. If the problem persists, it might require valve body replacement or a transmission rebuild. A software update may also address shifting issues.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $150 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (transmission rebuild)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Hesitation or Delay in Shifting**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Experiencing a delay or hesitation when shifting gears, which is most noticeable during acceleration.
    *   Solution: The issue may be caused by a faulty solenoid pack, valve body, or transmission control module (TCM). The solution is to diagnose the root cause and replace faulty parts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $500 - $2,000+
    *   Recalls: None Found

    *   Solution: Try a soft reset by holding the power button down. If the problem persists, a software update from the dealership may be necessary. In some cases, the head unit may need to be replaced.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $0 (soft reset) - $1,200+ (head unit replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Backup Camera Issues**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The backup camera displays a black screen, distorted image, or fails to activate when the vehicle is in reverse.
