### Summary Verdict
The 2007 Chrysler 300 presents a mixed reliability profile. While its V6 and V8 engines are generally robust, owners should be aware of potential oil and coolant leaks, particularly with the 2.7L and 3.5L V6s, and specific issues like cylinder deactivation problems in the HEMI. The automatic transmission can experience harsh shifting or slipping, often requiring significant repair. Electrical gremlins, especially related to the Body Control Module and alternator, are not uncommon. Exterior paint and headlight clarity can degrade over time. Interior climate control and seat heater issues are also reported. Despite these potential issues, many 300s remain reliable with diligent maintenance and timely repairs of known problem areas.
