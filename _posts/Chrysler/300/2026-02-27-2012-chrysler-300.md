### Summary Verdict
The 2012 Chrysler 300 is a capable and stylish sedan, but potential buyers should be aware of common issues. The Pentastar V6 and HEMI V8 engines can experience coolant and oil leaks, with the HEMI also susceptible to lifter wear. The 5-speed automatic transmission may develop problems with the torque converter or valve body. Electrical gremlins related to the BCM and Uconnect system are not uncommon. Suspension components can wear, leading to noises, and interior climate control actuators are a known failure point. While many issues are repairable, they can represent significant costs. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to warning signs are crucial for maintaining reliability.
