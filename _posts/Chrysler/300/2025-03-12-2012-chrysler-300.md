The 2012 Chrysler 300 is a full-size sedan that offered a blend of luxury and performance at a relatively accessible price point. Engine options included a 3.6L Pentastar V6 (292 hp, 260 lb-ft torque), a 5.7L Hemi V8 (363 hp, 394 lb-ft torque), and a 3.0L V6 diesel in some markets. All engines were paired with either a 5-speed or 8-speed automatic transmission, depending on the engine and trim level. People liked the 300 for its spacious interior, bold styling, and available V8 power. Common dislikes included its fuel economy (especially with the V8), some lower-quality interior materials, and occasionally reported electrical glitches.

**Engine**

**3.6L Pentastar V6**

*   **Oil Filter Housing Leak**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Oil leak from the plastic oil filter adapter housing. This can lead to low oil levels and potential engine damage. Symptoms include visible oil leaks, oil spots under the vehicle, and the smell of burning oil.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the oil filter adapter housing with an updated design, preferably one made of aluminum instead of plastic.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $300 - $600+
    *   Recalls: None Found

**5.7L Hemi V8**

*   **Hemi Tick (Lifter Failure)**
    *   Description/Symptoms: A distinct ticking or tapping sound coming from the engine, often most noticeable at idle or low speeds. This is often due to a failing or collapsed hydraulic lifter. In some cases, it can be caused by broken exhaust manifold bolts.
    *   Solution: Replacement of the affected lifters and potentially the camshaft if it has been damaged. Replacing exhaust manifold bolts.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $4,000+ for lifters/cam; $300 - $800 for manifold bolts.
    *   Recalls: None Found

*   **Exhaust Manifold Bolt Failure**
    * Description/Symptoms: Broken exhaust manifold bolts leading to exhaust leaks. This can cause a ticking noise, reduced fuel economy, and a noticeable exhaust smell.
    * Solution: Replacement of broken exhaust manifold bolts, typically with upgraded bolts to prevent future failures.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $300-$800+
    * Recalls: None Found

**Transmission**

**5-Speed Automatic**

*   **Rough Shifting/Slipping**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Harsh or delayed shifts, especially between 1st and 2nd gear, or slipping during acceleration. Can be caused by worn clutches, valve body issues, or low transmission fluid.
    *   Solution: Diagnosis by a qualified mechanic, which may involve a transmission fluid flush, valve body repair or replacement, or a complete transmission rebuild or replacement.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 (fluid flush) - $3,000+ (rebuild/replacement)
    *   Recalls: None Found

**8-Speed Automatic (specifically models equipped with it)**

**Suspension**

*   **Premature Wear of Suspension Components**
    *   Description/Symptoms: Premature wear of ball joints, tie rod ends, and control arm bushings. This can result in clunking noises, uneven tire wear, and poor handling.
    *   Solution: Replacement of worn suspension components with quality aftermarket or OEM parts. Regular inspection and lubrication of suspension components can help prevent premature wear.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $200 - $1,000+, depending on the components needing replacement.
