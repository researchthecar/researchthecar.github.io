The 2008 Chrysler 300 is a full-size sedan that offered a blend of classic American styling and comfort. Engine options ranged from the base 2.7L V6 producing 190 hp and 190 lb-ft of torque, to the 3.5L V6 rated at 250 hp and 250 lb-ft of torque, the 5.7L HEMI V8 with 340 hp and 390 lb-ft of torque, and the top-of-the-line 6.1L HEMI V8 found in the SRT8 model, boasting 425 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque. The 2.7L and 3.5L engines were paired with a 4-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.7L and 6.1L HEMI engines used a 5-speed automatic transmission. Owners appreciate the 300's distinctive look, spacious interior, and smooth ride. Criticisms often include fuel economy, some build quality issues, and repair costs.

**Engine**

**2.7L V6**

*   **Engine Sludge Buildup**
    *   Description/Symptoms: The 2.7L V6 engine is prone to sludge buildup, especially if oil changes are not performed regularly. Symptoms include engine knocking, reduced performance, and potential engine failure.
    *   Solution: Regular oil changes with high-quality oil. Chemical engine flush may provide temporary relief but can also dislodge large pieces of sludge, potentially causing more issues. Engine replacement or rebuild if the issue is severe.
    *   Estimated Cost to Fix: $100 - $300 for chemical flush. $3,000 - $6,000+ for engine replacement/rebuild.
    * Recalls: None Found

**3.5L V6**

* **Timing Chain Issues**
    * Description/Symptoms: Premature wear or failure of the timing chain due to insufficient lubrication or age, resulting in a rattling noise, especially upon startup. Can lead to poor engine performance or complete engine failure if left unaddressed.
    * Solution: Replacement of the timing chain, tensioners, and guides. Inspection of the oil pump for proper function.
    * Estimated Cost to Fix: $1,500 - $2,500+
    * Recalls: None Found
