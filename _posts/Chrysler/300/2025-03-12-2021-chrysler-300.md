The 2021 Chrysler 300 is a full-size sedan known for its comfortable ride, spacious interior, and available V8 power. Engine options include a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 292 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (300 horsepower and 264 lb-ft of torque in the 300S) and a 5.7L HEMI V8 producing 363 horsepower and 394 lb-ft of torque. All engine options are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Owners often praise the 300 for its classic styling, smooth ride, and powerful engine options. Common dislikes include its aging platform, fuel economy (especially with the V8), and some interior materials.
